People often speak about THE open source community but there are actually many open source communities which differ in a number of ways, including aspects related to technology, processes, governance and philosophy. Each open source community has its own culture and norms. In this talk, we'll talk about open source culture and community norms and discuss how to get started contributing to open source. I'll use Debian as an example of one open source community but the lessons learned will be applicable to other projects.

to Martin who is a free and open-source

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,460
software developer advocate from the

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,319
Debian developer community currently

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,900
president of software in the public

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,889
interest

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,580
Martin was elected the Debian project

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,580
lead in 2003 so people often speak about

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,289
the open-source community but there's

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,850
actually many different communities and

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,800
many different configurations of this

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,500
and they differ greatly in many

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,390
different ways so Martin will take us

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,610
into the journey of these communities

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,910
and what it means to be supporting them

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,910
can we change

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,100
hi I'm Marty Makaha I'm very excited to

00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,440
be here it's my first for Asia and I've

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,710
actually wanted to come for for many

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,369
years and I just briefly wanted to talk

00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,289
about open source community and and

00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:02,619
before I forget I will talk about the

00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:05,439
same topic on Sunday in more detail so

00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:09,130
open source obviously has achieved you

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,549
know many things we have so many so many

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,600
software out there and so many companies

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,899
participating nowaday it's been a huge

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
success from a technology you know from

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:21,159
a point of view of the technology but

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,560
also in terms of the community how how

00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,020
we do things how we produce the software

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,030
I think it's amazing how people all over

00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,979
all around the world collaborate

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,979
together to produce this software

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,390
so one of the things I've noticed is

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:46,909
that a lot of people talk about the open

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,069
source community as if as if there was

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,020
only one community and it and it worked

00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:52,369
the same way but actually there are

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,469
there are so many different communities

00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:57,020
there are really thousands of different

00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:58,789
communities and if you actually look at

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,439
them in detail you will see that they

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,810
work in very different ways

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,759
and if you want to become involved in

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,899
open source you need to learn those

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,819
differences you need to understand you

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,290
know how how the project works and some

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,690
of those differences in terms of

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,870
technologies but some of them also in

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,319
terms of the social norms so for example

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,160
if you look at open source they define

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,360
in a number of ways in in technologies

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,329
you know the different programming

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,150
language is the infrastructure is

00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:35,239
different you know what kind of bug

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,760
tracking system do they use you know how

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,769
do they store the the source code stuff

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,730
like this I mean do be honest because of

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:45,260
github things are getting much more like

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,200
common eyes like a lot of projects are

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,540
using the same processes but especially

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,310
the large open source projects they they

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,169
have their own project infrastructure

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,359
and do things in a different ways the

00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:59,030
process is I was quite different how do

00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:01,340
you submit patches how do things get

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,220
approved the governance of the project

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:07,299
is is vastly different where some

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,220
project have you know several committees

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,650
and other projects have like you know

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,780
one main guy who makes the final

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,480
decision the philosophy of the project

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,889
can can can vary quite a bit and for

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,290
example you can see that in terms of

00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,299
Licensing where you have the permissive

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,040
people on one hand who basically say

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,130
well open source free software it means

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,220
you can do whatever you want even if

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,989
that means closing the software down and

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,639
then on the other hand you have the like

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,400
the copy life people who basically say

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,260
well freedom means that the freedom

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,750
needs to be preserved for everyone so

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,639
you can you can close it down and and

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,509
these are different philosophies we see

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,519
and and the philosophy it doesn't just

00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,640
impact the license but also how how

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,470
people do things how people you know

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,440
govern the project how they lead stuff

00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:02,230
and in the culture can can really bear

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:06,700
inspire so I'm involved in in the Debian

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:09,459
project and Debian has produced you know

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,260
a lot of great software and I could give

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,120
you a lot of facts you know about how

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,570
many how many software packages we have

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,640
how many architectures we suppose a lot

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,850
of those technical details but really

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,320
when I think of Debian III really think

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,970
of something like this you know the

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,300
community this is what it's all about

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,919
and this shows people like where the

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,050
Debian developers can be found so we

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,330
have a lot of people in Europe we've

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,390
quite a few people in in you know in in

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,340
the u.s. America and then we have a few

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,880
people in Asia but really we need we

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,580
need more people in Asia and here is

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,000
another photo from the the Debian

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,419
conference so we have a conference every

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,669
year and this this was an adding bra and

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,830
this is really what Debian is about like

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,320
it's the people and and I've been

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,720
involved in like for like 20 years and

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,669
some of those people have known for for

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,570
that time you know I remember when we

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:10,150
were students when we went to conference

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,190
we would sleep on on the floor will you

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,800
take the bus and then a few years later

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,510
we would suddenly have jobs and we would

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,370
like oh you know let's share a taxi

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,460
who's gonna pay well you know you know

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,500
redhead or HP like who cares

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,520
so things and people people get older

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,240
right I used to look quite different and

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,340
and I think the whole and this is my

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,140
conferences like these are so important

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,830
is because at the end of the day it's

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,330
all about the people the community but

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,280
one thing you have to realize is

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,890
community has different etiquettes it

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,930
has norms it has rituals and it also has

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,200
history and you need to be aware of

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,370
those things in order to be able to

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:56,370
contribute in an active effective manner

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,510
[Music]

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,900
one of the things is that is the

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,850
violating community norms is

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:08,100
is really bad so when someone is new to

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,770
free software open source and they did

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,479
very excited they want to contribute and

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,300
they come to the project but then they

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,220
do something which which the project

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,350
find finds weird because that's not the

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,850
way we do things and actually one thing

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,840
that's very strange

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,850
is that we humans when I meet someone at

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,550
the conference I would go up and say hey

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm Martin and and I would shake the

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,630
hand or something but the thing is an

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,760
open-source project on the internet we

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,220
actually don't do that when actually

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,350
someone sends an email to mailing list

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,300
introducing himself saying hey I'm Marty

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,919
and I will contribute to this project if

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,830
I really need me like this I'm it's like

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,990
weird that's not how we do things you

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,910
contribute not by introducing yourself

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,460
but like sending a patch of bug report

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,169
saying hey this is broken you know you

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,199
can improve it in this way and here is a

00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:00,419
patch so these are things that if you're

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,970
new to open-source you need to learn how

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:06,060
to do things so in order to be an

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:08,160
effective contributor just knowing that

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,889
technology isn't enough you need to

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,810
learn about the social norms but the

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:19,139
thing is that open source is is a lot of

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,030
fun I mean you have the opportunity to

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,919
work with really smart people all around

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,930
the world I mean if you work for a

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,599
company they might have some smart

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,490
people but no single company has has you

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,820
know all the smart people in the world

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,620
but with open source you can work with

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,840
with all those people even if they're

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,190
competitors you can work with them an

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,380
open source attracts some of the

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,940
smartest people out there you can make

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,039
friends all over the world

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,870
so when I travel usually I can meet

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,849
people I have you know invitations to

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,770
stay with people it's it's just so much

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:54,479
fun and you also learn about different

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,820
cultures and and actually I also see

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,949
that a lot of people they come because

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,720
of the technology but then they stay

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,970
because of the community because that's

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,099
who their friends are and and and it

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,320
gives them a sense of belonging it gives

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:11,550
them a sense of accomplishment and and

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,169
of of being part of a tribe so yeah

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,259
that's that's all I wanted to say

00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:18,389
and on Sunday I'm giving a talk going

00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,550
into some of the more details about how

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,290
how to do things or things to look out

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,419
for thank you

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,419
