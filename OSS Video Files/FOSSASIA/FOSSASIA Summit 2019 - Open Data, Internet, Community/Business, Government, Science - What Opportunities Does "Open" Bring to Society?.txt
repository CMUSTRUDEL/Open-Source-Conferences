Title: Business, Government, Science - What Opportunities Does "Open" Bring to Society?
Publication date: 2019-03-31
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Open Data, Internet, Community
Description: 
	15 March 2019 11:40, Lecture Theatre

In the Panel: Mario Behling, Bunnie Huang, Dang Hong Phuc,  Shanker V Selvadurai, Dr. Graham Williams, Carsten Haitzler

2009 Obama promised a New Era of Openness. The idea was that openness prevails. Talking about the Freedom of Information Act at that time Obama said that openness "means more than simply informing the American people how decisions are made." It also means recognizing that the government doesn’t have all the answers. To that end, he directed members of his administration to "find new ways of tapping the knowledge of ordinary Americans" — scientists, educators, entrepreneurs — to find ways to solve the problems of our times. While his message as the US president was directed towards Americans, for the FOSS community, developers, designers, content creators, makers, entrepreneurs and of course companies active in our community “openness prevails” has always been true. Openness for us is not just an idea to access information, it is the basis for amazing collaboration models in the FOSS community.

At FOSSASIA developers work across time zones, countries, and continents and anyone can join development. Imagine how difficult it would be to develop our products if we had to get everyone to sign NDAs and Copyright agreements. This would cause a huge overhead, but there are different models and possibilities to how what extend openness can prevail and in this panel we would like to get insights into how open development, open communication, open tools and technologies, open knowledge and open collaboration has benefited organizations and work of our panelists.


In the second part of the panel we would like to talk about the future. What are plans of panelists for the future in their organization in regards to opening up and creating new opportunities? And in the bigger picture how will society change and open up and what opportunities and challenges lie in opening up areas of society? Panelists will answer these questions from their specific point of view as managers of a large tech corporation, successful Open Hardware makers, representatives of a community driven Open Tech company, or a manager in a computer processor company.

let me give a quick introduction to the

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,069
panel and what this is about

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,530
this is really talking to the bigger

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,540
picture on how society will change and

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,039
open up and what opportunities and

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,180
challenges lie in this area panelists

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,060
will answer questions from the aesthetic

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,789
points of view as managers a blog tech

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,260

have it and yeah so they're always

00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,290
related to tech and and mathematics I

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:17,400
really like these connections to music

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,310

so so you also have different

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,769
perspectives to what open means to

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,810
different players so thank you very much

president and CTO of cloud and cognate

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,329
cloud and cognitive software of IBM and

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,639
yeah

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,739
you lead the technical organization that

00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,870
helps clients across Asia Pacific to

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,019
explore and co-create cloud-based

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,879
solutions that leverage data analytics

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:56,189
and AI capabilities to deliver better

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,269
decisions and outcomes yeah so I know

00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,099
that it down here for me

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,299
so while leading teams varying in size

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:04,799
from six to over a thousand I think very

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,199
different kind of style you have to work

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,359
with different teams like and so and you

00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,449

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,880
and then after onwards you have a like a

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,090
very long story so I think you have the

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,610

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,720
Bachelor of Science and a Master of

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,669
Business Administration you know so even

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:42,020

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:45,040
thank you very much for joining and we

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,380
have doctor grayham Williams here and

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,070
director of data science and at

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:56,090
Microsoft and Graham has been an open

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:59,110

Martin yeah and yeah are and you have

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,850
the developer of various machine

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,770
learning tool kits and he remains a

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,740
strong advocate for open source and his

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,320
practitioner research and educator in AI

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,930
in his current role with Microsoft he

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,120
leads a team of data scientists working

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,650
with business to implement machine

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,660
learning solutions and to drive open

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,169
source product development you know also

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,020

books on the AI topic so thank you very

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,770
much for joining

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,910
and finally Carsten Heights LA so

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,320
probably many know you like many who

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,380
have been to the first Asia Summit

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,419
before but also to other events and you

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,510
we can meet you at many events and

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,970
you've worked in Linux and open source

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,310
industries for twenty years more than 20

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,400
years but you also started originally

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:12,440
actually as a community contributor and

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,630
to the enlightenment desktop in window

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,840
manager project and you have written a

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,610
lots of graphics related code for x11

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,870
him and that's 20 years of programming

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,690
mostly in C and assembly on top of Linux

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,160
shipping in now listen 100 million

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,810
devices around the globe

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,139
that's something so big round of

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,139
applause

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,910
so we see already that we have different

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:46,890
perspectives and for me the perspective

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,890
was in 2009 President Obama said that

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,700
openness prevails so I don't know if

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:56,470
anyone was here 2009 and and remembers

00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,830
how the time was it was all about

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:02,290
openness and there was the Freedom of

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,750
Information Act at that time and it was

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,990
the time when first ADA was founded so

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,480
it just fit it perfectly into that time

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,910
and a lot of politicians were talking

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,720
about this and for us as an open tech

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,600
community

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,720
um it was just natural it was just logic

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,940
that we should have open-source software

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,460
but also like information about how the

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,500
government is doing about open science

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,440
and so on things should be like it

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,010
should be accessible and and not just

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,260
out of a theory because actually out of

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,950
a collaboration model we just have to

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,480
talk how Indian is not many only a

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,220
software project it's like a global

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,500
community you have connections

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:49,420
everywhere you have friends everywhere

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:51,220
so this was very natural for us and the

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,000
question now is like what does this

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,920
panel have like how's the background of

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,800
this penso openness for us it's not just

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,210
an idea it is the basis for

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:07,270
collaboration in the force community and

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:10,000
for example imagine we all have to sign

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,970
NDA's we all have to sign copyright

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,460
agreements what we have ever worked to

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,850
do together maybe many wouldn't have

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:22,650
yeah it would just be too complicated

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:27,840
and it would cause a lot of overhead so

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,840
it really enables us to collaborate

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,490
so um in this panel now I have a few

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,179
questions and I would like to get

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,420
insights into how this idea of openness

00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:50,149
changes your daily work and changes the

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,939
work and your organization on your

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:55,100
community or in your life and how it

00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:57,920
changes your development your

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,209
communications and tools and

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,029
technologies and how you work together

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:08,360
so I think like we have the biggest

00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:11,660
contrast here right next to us like a

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,929
bunny comes from a very like open model

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,449
then also going into business areas I

00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:20,240
saw like some of your projects on a

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:22,040
crowd supply yeah and and we have a

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,629
another area here which is more from a

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,240
corporate perspective and I really don't

00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,100
know who to start with first but as you

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,160
haven't had the chance to say anything

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,740
today and I would like to give Shankar

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,649
here the the opportunity to say

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,720
something first so about openness him in

00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:45,619
IBM I think that microphone should work

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:47,829
yeah yeah yes yeah can we switch on the

00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,829
other

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,800
okay sorry sorry about that

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:13,740
that's all right yeah well thanks my

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,990
things real opportunity before I started

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:21,209
just do a little quick poll here you

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,810
plug your hands how many of you are

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:31,829
aware of IBM's involvement in open

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:35,240
source okay it's a 50% okay it's pretty

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:37,680
good I was expecting lower than that

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,959
some people may be thinking that I'm

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,790
here representing IBM because we

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:46,190
recently announced the acquisition Red

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,899
Hat that's a relationship but actually

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,190
the just wouldn't put in context right

00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:55,620
so iBM has been involved in open source

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,600
way way before it was cool or a lots of

00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,250
people are talking about it so this was

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,300
probably 20 years 20 more than 20 years

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,820
ago in the 90s but we helped establish

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,829
the Apache foundation and then the

00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,029
Eclipse Foundation and the valley next

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:14,490
foundation right and and when we did

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:16,079
that right we how we supported the

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,269
communities and projects was that no

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,480
first you know we either committed money

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,940
to it for example in Linux we committed

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,260
invested of 1 billion dollars to the

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,730
Linux Foundation we committed make

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,029
significant code contributions for

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,370
example the Apache HTTP server the

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:38,699
Eclipse Java IDE framework and more

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,519
recently the high pledge of fabric right

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,890
we also dedicate resources to this as

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,069
well right for example technical

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:50,250
resources engineer developers to

00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:53,610
contribute code on a sustained basis as

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:57,630
well as lead projects immense projects

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:59,760
right and we also provide legal help for

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,610
these communities in terms of writing

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,170
those licenses as well as supporting

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,490
them in marketing activities right

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,990
because we got to create the banners

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,310
around open source and service projects

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,649
right

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,470
wondrous thing we also do is that we

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:16,740
also arbitrate differences within the

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,589
community a good example would be no js'

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,870
right there's a point in time where the

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:23,519
folks in no js' community had

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,519
differences of opinion and they were

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,220
about to fork right and they called came

00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,819
to IGN and we helped arbitrate so that

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,559
it came back together so so those are

00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,720
some of the things that you know we've

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,910
been doing right and in the last five

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,569
years we've actually ramped up further

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,899
our investment commitment to open source

00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:48,059
right and this is from a enabling

00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,309
enterprise capability open source all

00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,439
the way from Cloud Foundry to talker

00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:56,579
Club daily computing foundation

00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:59,249
kubernetes tends to flow no I mean

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:03,300
hundreds of projects right today no from

00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:04,709
a from a monthly perspective right we're

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,600
looking for a month right we are

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,430
contributing to about 400 projects in

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,540
the open source community at any point

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:15,990
in time so that's a real brief around

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:20,160
IBM right so there's one touch a little

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,240
bit about you know how does IBM you know

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,279
what's what's what's why is this

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,290
important I being right

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,480
but before that let me put in context

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:30,360
right what's happening the industry

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,550
today is that lots of and I'm I'm

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,290
speaking from an enterprise perspective

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:38,610
because that's where IBM is focused on

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,949
okay and look at that right and press

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,579
today are most of them are going through

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:45,959
some sort of digital transformation and

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:49,430
and that district transformation is

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:52,199
expected to drive innovation and growth

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,709
but the innovation in growth doesn't

00:13:52,199 --> 00:14:00,300
start with the C expose the guys at the

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:02,699
top right it fundamentally starts with

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,879
the developers the coders did it data

00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:08,189
scientists basic the folks who are here

00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,679
when you guys you guys are the ones were

00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:13,529
fundamentally driving that innovation

00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:18,770
and growth in fact in a recent research

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:21,380
right the study says that 95 percent

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,200
of IT implementation today are

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:28,040
influenced by developers like yourself

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:33,200
right and in half of that are actually

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:36,770
making buying decisions so you know how

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,899
does that whole lot of developers 50%

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,060
are contributing to open source whether

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,140
in an individual capacity or part of a

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:47,089
company right so now you know right

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,520
developers contributing open source

00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,130
driving innovation so that's kind of

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,990
intuitive right innovation power drives

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:58,970
open source is kind of intuitive the

00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:02,300
concept that all of us together are

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,770
smarter than anyone of this right makes

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,020
sense

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,080
and you cannot drive that piece of

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:12,080
innovation without a collaborative

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:16,310
development effort but what is not

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:20,209
intuitive or not obvious is the economic

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,130
benefits of poconos right and let me put

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,660
that little illustrate to you guys right

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,790
for example right you know IBM and I'm

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,360
bringing I've in context sure you've got

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:32,290
IBM engineers participating in this open

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,149
source projects right and they take that

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,579
we're good to go back to our products

00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,980
and put it into our products and then we

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:42,980
enhance it or incorporate enterprise

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,209
capabilities scalability availability

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,420
reliability all those things that

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:50,360
Enterprise need right let me take that

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,779
toward APIs and then sell it right and

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,459
we make profit right we make profits

00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,860
sorry to the customers the customers

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:00,079
come back and tell us feedback use

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,970
feedback or additional requirements

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,980
that's where the reinvestment happens

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,940
the same engine business engineers go

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:12,440
back into the community can now make the

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:15,260
project even better and in turn make the

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,870
product better right and that drives

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,620
even more profit okay

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,230
it creates a whole new market because we

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,260
create new product we've got creating

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:30,270
more of a shareholder value right and

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:34,260
that cycle again right could

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:36,360
expand and accelerate so that's the

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,490
power of you know innovation and you

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,430
know in 10 the economic benefits of open

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:45,990
source and in IBM what we're doing is

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:48,210
that you know if open source technology

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,170
is fundamental to everything that we're

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,160
doing from a strategic perspective

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,950
whether it's cloud data AI even

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,880
component computing right what does that

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:04,950
mean I mean it means that you know open

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:07,950
source open data open standards and an

00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:10,470
architecture that is you know open by

00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,140
design so if you take a look at our

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:16,190
cloud platform you know we're

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,170
incorporating we're trying to drive

00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,700
commonality of platforms across private

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,250
and public cloud whether it's our cloud

00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,410
or anybody else crowd leveraging

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,200
containers and kubernetes and you heard

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,880
my colleague earlier on Rahu talked

00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,820
about how we are leveraging open source

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,970
an AI as well in blockchain we're

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,340
driving the leveraging the hydrologic

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,140
fabric right now even in

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,920
emerging technologies like quantum

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:46,830
computing we have opened up the quantum

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,010
computing to kids like Chris get to the

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,290
public right and and this is you know I

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,000
think it's critical because even the

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,290
emerging technology we strongly believe

00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,490
that the open approach is much better

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:04,830
than a proprietary porridge right so you

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,280
know that's sort of a brief on you know

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,750
why from IBM perspective right I just

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,180
what I had a couple of points here right

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,300
so you may be thinking is this just a

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,180
bender play no it's not just a vendor

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,310
play it's not just a community play also

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,460
it is now I think it's an enterprise

00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,290
play because enterprises now large

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,800
organizations not just technology

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:31,410
providers are invest in open source

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,120
because they are realizing the reward

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,540
and the benefits and reaping the

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,690
benefits of open source innovation right

00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,940
we look at AT&T Morgan Stanley

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,060
what is of enhancing even space program

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,150
right you look at NASA they opened up

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,370
the code for the Mars rover program to

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,140
spur innovation from the 24 million

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,650
developers that we caught we have across

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,000
the roll right so and and the

00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,620
enterprises are not just doing for the

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,380
innovation right they are also trying to

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,070
reduce vendor lockup the trainer is when

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,790
you're walking increase interoperability

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,830
portability as well as and I think

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,950
fundamental to this is they have access

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,140
to this mass pool of developers in the

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,170
open source environment who are driving

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,790
this innovation for them so that's a

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,350
pretty pretty breed look Bri for now you

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,420
know how we know from an enterprise

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:29,640
perspective from a company like IBM

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:32,710
prosperity how open source is Benedictus

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,920
ok thank you very much that was like

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:39,310
kind of a good circle from a corporate

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,120
perspective and but I also remembered

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:47,070
years maybe not so much IBM but other

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:51,220
companies that had a different opinion

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:56,380
about open source and Graham is smiling

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:59,110
already and yeah and like I also know

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,360
your story right I mean about it like

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,700
that you have been a contributor for

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,660
many years to free and open source

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,450
software so for you personally this is

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,850
also a very personal story because today

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,010
you're working for Microsoft and it

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,410
would be very interesting to hear a bit

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:22,630
of your story how things have changed

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:25,000
over time and how you ended up actually

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,100
working for Microsoft today and being

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,410
convinced that this is a good thing

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,720
right because you're really we're in the

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,990
freeze of a community or a member of the

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,180
community and yeah if you could share

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,120
your personal story thank you thank you

00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:43,470
Mario

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:47,980
so I do find myself in a company today

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,070
that I spent most of my life fighting

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,540
against

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:56,630
indeed to the extent that I but my

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,780
children grew up with no Microsoft in

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:03,260
their household at all we were a

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:09,130
completely open-source family if you

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:10,910
like and you know I I date my

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,410
involvement in the open-source community

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:18,500
back to the 1980s back in the a Estonian

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,880
national university in those days andrew

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,150
tridgell was there with us paul

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:28,520
Mackerras martin Schwenke martin shrinky

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:30,530
and i and is in IBM martin shrinky and i

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,570
developed one of the first packaging

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:37,880
tools for Emacs and given that we have

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:46,820
precedents of a poll how many Emacs

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:54,190
users are in the audience how many by

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:54,190
users wrong conference

00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:02,690
how many vs code users Wow

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:06,590
that's a good number two how many V is

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:10,250
code server uses does anyone know V s

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:13,480
code server okay so check inverse code

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:17,540
server web just recently browser-based

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:21,410
all of them are open source tools so I

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:26,080
started off I stuck with v-max Emacs can

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:32,900
do everything that I can do and more but

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:35,720
still alive and still today use Emacs

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,000
and purely open source stack I've been

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,330
involved in the tech tech community as

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,900
well setting up Seaton Seaton the

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:49,340
precursor of cran for our of our Sipan

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:52,340
for for Perl and so on so I've spent 30

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:56,480
or more years very much in the

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:58,390
open-source community and I brought open

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,570
source to the Australian Government's

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,350
data science

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,180
capabilities 12 years ago and it's a

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,290
fairly telling story actually before I

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,140
tell that story let me tell the story

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,640
from the 90s when I was working of our

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,910
Department of Health which really

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,780
underlined for me why open source is so

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:20,940
important we were developing AI based

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:26,070
systems my day job is a machine learning

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:28,800
researcher AI researcher we built AI

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,630
machine learning based tools for health

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,560
in Australia Department of Health and

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:37,830
1990s we used a tremendous really

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:42,360
advanced tool at that time it was IBM's

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:46,790
intelligent miner really nice tool for

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:50,370
doing data science data mining and so on

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,590
we implemented a system for the

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,680
Australian health care to identify

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:59,400
fraudulent behavior amongst medical

00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,190
practitioners and amongst patients we

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,510
implemented that system deployed it

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,510
unfortunately and we had really good

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,970
relationships with IBM I should say

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,950
unfortunately as with many products and

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,350
any vendor they decided that that

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,170
product was end-of-life maybe it was

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:18,840
before its time it was end-of-life and

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:22,310
we had spent in the department millions

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:26,130
of dollars investing in that product and

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:28,800
we came to a dead end now we could use

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,960
the product but we couldn't develop

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,680
further on it we couldn't get into the

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,380
source and maintain it and so on so we

00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,230
were stuck with end-of-life and that was

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,570
a very costly experience for us and that

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:46,140
really reinforced for me the importance

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,390
of open source and another thing I kind

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,870
of probably want to get out of my system

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,760
is it is why do we have F at the

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,940
beginning of fuss and and the question

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,170
was raised earlier on today I I think a

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,830
lot of you in the audience were probably

00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:05,950
sharing with me that I actually F is not

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:08,899
free as in free beer its f as

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,809
freedom and that's the most important

00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:14,539
thing for me about why open-source is so

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:16,729
important it's the freedom that it gives

00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:18,950
me and my teams and developers to

00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:22,429
innovate and to use that software in

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,710
ways that we want to use it now of

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:28,219
course and so I was going to tell the

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,200
story 1215 years ago I joined the

00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:33,109
Australian government from from a

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,179
research organization Australia and they

00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:36,919
wanted me to build their analytics team

00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:39,830
they had a hundred and fifty data

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,369
analysts I was purely open-source they

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:48,049
had already gone through the procurement

00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:49,999
process they acquired SAS assess what's

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:55,099
called minor something minor enterprise

00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:56,899
miner and they asked us to come in I set

00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:00,080
up a team mostly I open source people

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,489
from researchers and they set us in

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,559
front of this commercial software and

00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,450
asked us to stop using the open source

00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,609
software that could already do more than

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,309
what this closed source software could

00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:14,710
do and just use this commercial product

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:16,940
and it took me three years to build

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,969
infrastructure of the first open source

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,580
stack of using Debian across Australia

00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:24,589
we set up a network of servers running

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,629
Debian and an open source stack to do

00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:28,729
data science and took me three years and

00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:31,700
a lot of that three years we spent

00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:35,839
fighting the IT department if you like

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,700
and the fight with IT was around hey

00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,639
we've got a standard operating

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,129
environment it's Microsoft Microsoft is

00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:44,629
telling us open source software is

00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:47,599
really really dangerous

00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:52,279
this was the Halloween times this was

00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,599
the Microsoft CEO telling open-source

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,460
people how bad we are

00:26:53,599 --> 00:27:00,649
we're communists um we are against

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,809
American society that's probably

00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:06,200
exaggerating it a bit or maybe not but

00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:08,960
it was a really challenging time to

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,539
convince our IT departments that

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,359
actually open-source software is so much

00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:16,369
better and more secure we can look at it

00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,769
we can innovate with that we can change

00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,630
it we have the freedom to do what we

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:23,550
want to do with

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:26,350
software and that's been my mantra

00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,380
forever really that I want the freedom

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:33,220
to do with the software what I want to

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,620
do to innovate so three years ago I was

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,670
finishing up my time with the Australian

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:43,600
government and Microsoft came knocking

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:48,070
on the door and hey this is this is

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,860
ludicrous publicly I am very anti very

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,770
anti Microsoft but they are knocking on

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,440
the door and it's been some time

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:59,260
convincing me that Microsoft today is a

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,930
very different company and I'm still

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,720
there after three years which still

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,730
tells me that ok I unconvinced that

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,550
there's a massive cultural change

00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:13,890
happening and to be I think open-source

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:16,720
is going will win always in the end

00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,710
Microsoft is a very big open source

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,020
company today

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,080
now of course I'm from Microsoft I'm

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,380
paid by Microsoft I'm going to say that

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,370
but I stayed with Microsoft because I

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,870
truly see that transformation happening

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,120
Microsoft wouldn't buy wouldn't purchase

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:37,750
github if it wasn't in that

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,390
transformation Microsoft has always been

00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,730
a developer focused company it kind of

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:46,180
wants to be the platform for developers

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,550
and previously it wanted to be the

00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,070
platform for developers and make the

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,740
developers only use whatever they

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,660
produce it was a closed platform it was

00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,850
their platform it was Microsoft and

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:03,210
nothing but Microsoft under our new

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:06,910
executives that culture has changed

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:09,010
dramatically it still wants to be the

00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:11,530
platform of choice for developers and

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,260
everything we're doing now is to support

00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:16,150
developers how do we support any

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,520
developers whatever platform they're

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,800
developing on the other side of it of

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:26,730
course is purely commercial you look at

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:28,990
the cloud what's a major percentage of

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,990
the operating system running on the

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,630
cloud is open source is

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:39,039
a major percentage of that is that you

00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:42,070
want to Debian has a strong presence of

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,710
course Red Hat and Fedora also have

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:48,130
strong presence in the cloud people are

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,929
saying you know we want to use Linux on

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,820
the cloud as well as Windows and hence

00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:58,210
from a commercial point of view from

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,280
annajura and the cloud point of view we

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,809
make money out of Linux on the cloud as

00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,980
well as windows on the cloud and that's

00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:08,230
that's kind of the platform a future for

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,240
Microsoft I have a team of data

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,720
scientists machine learning AI people

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,630
part of a team worldwide there's 60 data

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,960
scientists in our group all of our work

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:24,070
all of my work is open-source we work

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:27,190
with customers we use our of Python deep

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,169
learning algorithms my favorite and

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,350
research areas around ensembles and

00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:34,030
decision trees all using open source and

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,190
only open source software working for

00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:39,309
the enterprise customers everything that

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:43,090
we learn most importantly for me we

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:45,880
feedback into the community so all of

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:48,220
the work that we do of our customers not

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,409
the intellectual property that relates

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,940
to the end of the the competitive

00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:54,010
advantage of the company but the

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,230
intellectual property that relates to

00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,150
the technology that we're using to

00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,760
develop that intellectual property for

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:04,809
the company so that algorithmic

00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:07,330
development we publish in github in open

00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:09,309
source we have recommendation toolkits

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:16,150
that we published computer vision

00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:18,370
toolkits a large collection of open

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:21,159
source software to support the data

00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,380
scientists but more than that we're also

00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,390
trying to see how do we empower everyone

00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,100
to do AI of machine learning everyone's

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,830
talking about AI machine learning at the

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,320
moment I've been in the community for 40

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,840
years this is the fourth surge of

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,480
interest in AI machine learning but how

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,890
do we get that technology into lots of

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,350
hands we do that by packaging and

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,059
sharing things and as I mentioned you

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,790
know one of my first ever open source

00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:53,620
projects was how to package packages for

00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:55,870
Emacs I've been involved with Seton

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,540
comprehensive tech archive packaging

00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:01,270
packages for lar tech packaging packages

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:06,640
for our packaging packages for Debian

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:10,270
and so on I wrote a utility to support

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,280
the administration of packages in Debian

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,040
and Ubuntu as well so I've always been

00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,840
about how do we package up things to get

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,120
that out there as easily as possible

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:25,960
with to anybody and to that extent I see

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,760
you'd wind up but to that extent I might

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,559
just advertise Saturday I'm talking

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,400
about something called ml hub dot a I

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:35,230
feel free to visit it it's a concept of

00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,840
how do we package up and share all that

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,490
we learn as data scientists back into

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,570
the community and in five minutes

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:45,700
demonstrate lots of different technology

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,570
so I want you to come to that talk and

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,880
talk to anymore

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:52,120
outside of that but let me just finished

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,419
to say open source I think has one

00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,790
Visual Studio code is an open source

00:32:55,419 --> 00:33:00,429
project widely used by the developer

00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:04,780
community and the most interesting thing

00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:07,000
I I see is Emacs and by users going to V

00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,730
s code and telling that I'm still Emacs

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,059
but they go to V s code and say this is

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:15,309
the best IDE that is out there it's open

00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:18,549
source and it's got commercial

00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:21,010
development behind it a little bit of a

00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:22,660
plug there thank you well thank you very

00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,340
much there were a lot of projects that

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,309
are open-source it's really exciting and

00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:31,210
I got the question before when Microsoft

00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:32,860
will release github is open source do

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,030
you know about it I mean yes or no is

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,850
sufficient

00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:39,280
I have no internal knowledge I've asked

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:42,130
the question myself too it's it's it's a

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,299
really interesting plus many other

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,809
products within Microsoft there is a a

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,269
pipeline

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:51,730
of discussion and products that are

00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:54,580
coming out open-source okay thank you

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,639
very much in one word I have heard a lot

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,059
from you was changed and I think I would

00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:03,039
like to talk to hope talk about this

00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,909
because you are working with companies

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,800
and companies are not it's not just like

00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:11,829
that they release code as open-source

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,889
but it also changes the way companies

00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:18,520
work and I know that inner source is a

00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:21,069
big topic and here so what do you

00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,770
observe what is changing in inside

00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:26,589
companies and when they use open source

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,659
products and collaborate with the open

00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,490
source community how is that going and

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,089
maybe there are also some challenges

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:37,030
what's your view on that before I answer

00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:41,409
that question I sometimes use Visual

00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:44,619
Studio code I'm not sure so there is I

00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:46,750
mentioned is because I think that the

00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:49,869
values of false for me it's more about

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,730
collaboration and it's truly unite it

00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:53,800
unites us together no matter what

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,569
background or status you are which left

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,180
for now we have independent from

00:34:55,569 --> 00:35:00,670
community from cooperation comes from

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,020
enterprise it was a changing and

00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,329
life-changing experience for me

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:08,109
I wasn't trained as an engineer but

00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:10,780
today I don't feel a big gap between a

00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:12,550
normal person like me and an engineer

00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,589
when you act inside the open-source

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,839
community people really collaborative

00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:17,170
and and they patients show you what to

00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,030
do

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:23,140
so last week I also write a strip about

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:25,720
how to remove duplicate and different a

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:27,910
function in expressions also I feel that

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,060
I'm also can be a developer I'm an

00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:33,400
interesting in technology and we don't

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,160
we don't look at the people based on

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,599
their status anymore so you you are here

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,130
we are here together when you want to

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm sure that if you want approach

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,180
eccentric William maybe you don't meet

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,030
them in a daily basis but because of

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:49,420
false everyone here is our echo we are

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:51,220
together we can do things together and

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,930
mario mentioned that okay I'm a female

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,520
I should be introduced for us I don't

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:57,480
care so much I don't want to be the same

00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,650
and anyone else here yeah we try to be

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,359
loser you've met at a community

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:05,640
inclusive and so what is so it back to

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,310
the question what I see in companies a

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,350
few years back we focus a lot on the

00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,390
community so when you call go into the

00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:15,270
post Asia if when you see a lot of

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:18,270
developers but the situation also

00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,680
changing so companies now so in some

00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,410
community they have the feeling that

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,630
okay I only want to to be close to our

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,100
developer and company they always do the

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,180
bad thing but it's actually not the case

00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:32,580
right now a Sanka the doctor perhaps

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:36,300
already mentioned IBM Microsoft they

00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,320
contribute a lot to to open source 50%

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,430
of the audience

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:43,740
learn about open source at IBM how about

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,540
the other 50% the reason why they did

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,750
not talk about it so much openly in the

00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,369
past year but more and more companies

00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,710
started to focus to do more outreach

00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:55,740
they want to be a connect with the

00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,650
community and it's at Amarillo mention

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,900
in the sauce so what he in assault NSO

00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,650
it applied the concept of open source

00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,000
how people develop in the open inside

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,590
company because they believe that when

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,910
people in different department and

00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,810
division in the company work together

00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:17,160
they can become more efficient and they

00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:19,680
and I worked with solando now in in

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,740
Germany this was a biggest e-commerce

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,080
platform in Europe similar to to Amazon

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,210
if you know of but focus on fashion and

00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:32,850
the company actually it released a lot

00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:35,130
of open source what I learned from them

00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,080
is that sometimes cooperation or

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,750
enterprise even though they care about

00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,210
Apple short they want to contribute a

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,220
community there's a lot of legal

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,990
compliance issue that you need to go

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,630
through so that delayed entire process

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,820
so the trend that I'm saying right now

00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,070
is that companies work together with the

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,500
developer community to work on solution

00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,660
to make things easier for the coverage

00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,820
to contribute to open source they also a

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,400
lot of automatic tolling 'z that allow

00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,550
you that guiding that do all the

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,220
compliant check so that have your

00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:11,490
internal developers or Department

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:14,790
release some software open-source and

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:17,369
also a Sun care doctor Malone's only

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,680
mentioned a lot there's so many way so

00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,690
many software that these big companies

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,130
release online and they really opened

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,770
not only to bush out there for you to

00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,720
use try to offer the solution but they

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,119
really want feedback from the community

00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,070
help them to improve the zulan and work

00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,230
together so not only you offer something

00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:37,170
to us our community but we will also

00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,000
work on tooling and solution that help

00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,099
you to make things easier for the

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,050
community so then what I see the biggest

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:46,859
values in force eight to bring people

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:50,160
together with our borders not not only

00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:54,540
physically but in terms of background in

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,369
terms of position or level and then I

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,530
also want to mention here that I have

00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,800
like two people he in depend on that I

00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:05,099
know for a long time and I really admire

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,500
Caston and bending so I read about their

00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:16,619
work online so they all have their own

00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:18,780
Wikipedia page which is really a lot to

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:22,020
share and we we can always be in the

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,849
same patient so I don't see the distant

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,700
in the Peabody or they were doing an

00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:29,700
amazing thing and normal person like me

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,619
so I'm truly appreciate what falls can

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,050
bring us together and give us an

00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,890
opportunity to be connected

00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:42,150
I think the bunny and Caston has more to

00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:44,460
share oh okay

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:49,380
my turn since everyone here gets to ask

00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:53,599
questions so okay I work at arm these

00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:59,609
days one of the reasons I work here is

00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:05,640
all there is that I have spent 10

00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:07,740
seconds is I've spent a lot of my life

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,080
by now doing open source it was

00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,570
accidental I never joined a cuz I wanted

00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,810
to I barely knew what it was

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:18,210
I wrote a window manager for me I really

00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,070
didn't care if anyone used it I thought

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,980
it was cool then someone saw the

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,050
screenshots and said we wanted

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,150
okay all right here's a tarball i mean

00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,800
well but it's a binary I don't want that

00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,050
give me source code and compile it from

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,600
my spark or some other system okay

00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,940
here's some source code and I

00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,060
accidentally stumbled into it lo and

00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,830
behold today the gen might work on that

00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,480
software that's gone on is now running

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,420
in hundreds of millions of devices

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:49,490
around the world and most of those

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:51,680
devices now use arm CPUs so arm the

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:55,430
company I work at we design intellectual

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,070
property reality is that almost everyone

00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,230
in the room here is not our customer

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,670
directly you don't buy stuff from us the

00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,109
people who buy stuff from us are worth a

00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,280
billions and billions of dollars and

00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:10,160
they make chips

00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:13,850
so who here it is using an arm CPU in

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:17,840
their daily life who here thinks they're

00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:19,820
not okay all right then I think reality

00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,090
is everyone uses it whether you like it

00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:26,930
or not and our customers really demand

00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:29,780
open source that is what almost all the

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:32,300
things we make run these days in most

00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,890
volume we build everything from we

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,520
design everything from server level

00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:39,530
chips so reality is that one of the top

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,650
500 supercomputers in the world is in

00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:46,040
fact ARM based all the way to everything

00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:48,830
in your pocket and it all runs at least

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,250
on a base of open-source arm has over

00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,720
the years changed very early it didn't

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,450
know about open source and didn't care

00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,210
and wasn't interested today it has

00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,820
changed to the point where it was about

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,460
a month or so ago we announced some new

00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:08,330
features in one of our new arm 64

00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,650
architectures I think it was 8.3 0.05

00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,820
I keep getting confused which it is

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,760
because I hear about them all day long

00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,040
but it was a new POF extensions

00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:18,500
literally within days we drop patches

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,619
for the kernel and it's at the point

00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,240
where that feature in the CPU isn't even

00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:25,100
going to hit silicon for another two

00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,280
years and there's already patches in the

00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,170
kernel to support it so and then that's

00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,829
not even the product getting into your

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,809
hands

00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:35,630
so reality is it's probably another six

00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:38,630
months after that at companies like

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,390
armed open source is so fundamental that

00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,130
we do work so far in advance of you even

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,749
getting it because that's what our

00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,549
customers demand and that's what the

00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:49,099
right thing is to do and that's how

00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:51,949
deeply embedded open source is in many

00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,209
companies I will pronounce tricks next

00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:54,979
to that there's certain parts of arm

00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:56,029
that don't believe in this I don't

00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:59,479
particularly want to talk about them

00:42:56,029 --> 00:43:01,069
today um but my division which is the

00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:03,589
central engineering open source division

00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:05,179
is one of the largest in arm and it's

00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:06,589
been growing steadily over the years and

00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:09,729
it's really important but this is

00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:13,969
important to customers it's important to

00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:15,199
the OEM to build devices and it's

00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:17,390
important right thing to do and I don't

00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:20,569
think there's any stopping it open

00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,429
source is an unmovable unchanging force

00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:24,890
that is going to eventually take over

00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:27,289
everything the only question is when do

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:31,119
you go and join the party and how

00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:31,119
effectively join the party when you do

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,770
thank you very much and Bonnie you

00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,380
didn't have the chance to say anything

00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:45,569
yet but I think your perspective is very

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:51,660
different because you're not working in

00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:54,030
a big company you like I think you have

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:58,020
more like ideas and you just like start

00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:00,089
to start them like constantly years ago

00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,880
I think about you you continuous so

00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:04,349
what's your what's your impression of

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,829
that like where do you see opportunities

00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:10,470
for openness and what's the take for you

00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:17,160
on it why why are you so excited and

00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:19,289
then to work in the open so I'm glad you

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,049
asked just that you that not all arm is

00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,849
on the open train because you know at

00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,650
some point in time I was gonna say like

00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:28,230
at some point in time I'm feeling and we

00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,910
were gonna have a big sort of war in

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,609
court with arm and their patents in the

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:33,900
open hardware space and you know

00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:36,030
architectural stuff because you know

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,349
it's been impossible to make make an arm

00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,030
open Hardware implementation because all

00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:40,319
the patents and then everyone's

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:45,779
accumulating patents and patents and

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:48,869
patents and now it's like risk 5 so

00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:52,380
we'll see how that goes so um in terms

00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:54,089
of like open I guess there's maybe the

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:59,869
two points I'll try to make it quick one

00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:59,869
is that from the standpoint of hardware

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,529
there's there's a saying that someone's

00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,970
has that any technology is sufficiently

00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:08,160
advanced is indistinguishable from magic

00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,380
or something like that right and the

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,190
problem is that when technology becomes

00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,930
magic it becomes religion right so you

00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,640
already have these sort of ritualistic

00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,799
things like genius bars that you go to

00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,240
you bring like your sacrificial device

00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:22,710
which has your whole life in it it's not

00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,690
working you pray to the God of the

00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,190
genius bar it maybe gives you a thing

00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,500
back to you that you can then get but

00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,420
you know the thing is is actually these

00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,789
are all made by humans at some point in

00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,470
time it's not like some Divine Being

00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:37,559
named Steve Jobs had just like you know

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,569
like popped into existence and like it

00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,400
was incomprehensible to mere mortals

00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:42,869
right but but there's there's an

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,829
advantage to these companies are trying

00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,869
to convince you that's the case because

00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:47,039
they make a lot more money selling these

00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:49,049
things to you instead of lying you

00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,400
repair it yourself upgrade the battery

00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:50,780
fix

00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,130
battery let use your phone for another

00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:57,160
five years or something like that right

00:45:52,130 --> 00:46:01,400
so to me a lot about openness is just

00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:04,220
like you don't have to be a hardware

00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,200
person necessarily I don't insist that

00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,420
everyone has to do that but you have to

00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,730
not feel trapped by your hardware right

00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,350
so if you ever want to hit find the exit

00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,430
to the room you don't you feel like you

00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,650
had too much of the cool you got to

00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,690
leave the religion like here's the trail

00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:20,210
of breadcrumbs you can pick up take

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,650
yourself to a freer place if you ever

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,720
need to get there right that's kind of

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,400
open open lease at this point and the

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,140
harder space is just getting there to

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,760
that point we don't we don't have the

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,440
ability and open heart yet to fully

00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,570
build and replace an open source phone

00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,220
for example but at least we have the

00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,500
trail breadcrumbs to maybe get you there

00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,000
at some point in time the other thing

00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,460
that I guess I would I would bring up

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,500
from the like the open site that is

00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,790
really helpful is that it it's um it's

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,560
really because when you can have

00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,480
conversations about the technology where

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,450
you're building you can actually do very

00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,980
quick validation with the community that

00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,040
something's gonna be there so like you

00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,570
know I really like Mitch's story about

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,950
liking the tv-b-gone is the thing I

00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,510
built for myself and it turns out like

00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,220
15 years later I'm like you know

00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,990
building and people still want it you

00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,340
could put a room full of Harvard MBAs

00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,930
together and have them think for like

00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,000
you know a month and a half and they

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,920
would never come up with this idea right

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,090
because it's just something that you you

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,770
would come up with and then validate

00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,450
with the community it's not obvious to

00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,940
these people right and this so there's

00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,890
many classic examples in in the world

00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,920
like you know for example Betamax versus

00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,420
VHS how many people here you know how

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,570
many people remember Betamax and VHS

00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,770
okay yeah it sort of served dates you

00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:30,080
had a certain age so this is there's

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,790
back in the day we used to have these

00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,800
tapes did we used to record videos on

00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:35,330
and we actually had to go to stores to

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,820
rent video some didn't down them online

00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:39,920
and there are two formats almost called

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,910
Betamax and one was called VHS Betamax

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,040
by Sony and VHS was by JVC and in

00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,120
Betamax Sony had put a lot of money in

00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,740
and developed it and they made it very

00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,180
close form and they want to sell it and

00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,710
they had a lot of really smart people

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,350
put it in and they were very proud of

00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:57,050
the fact they had high quality and it

00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:58,070
was a compact format right and then JVC

00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,570
and actually almost want to kill the

00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,550
project inside a couple of engineers on

00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,770
the inside like just in the

00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:06,050
like push the product out and juice as

00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:07,550
well you know we don't know but let's

00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,440
license it to some other people and see

00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,480
what happens right and then RCA picks it

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,070
up and they say like actually but we

00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,260
hear the market wants is a four hour

00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,760
runtime right so we're gonna do a mod on

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,890
the standard to do a four hour runtime

00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,480
it turns out people didn't care about

00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,490
the quality of they want to record the

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,870
whole Superbowl right with a having a

00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,130
swap tape so that was like the really

00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:27,110
important thing at the end of the day

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:30,620
was to record full broadcast and have

00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,850
runtime and so then RCA made the

00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,920
improvement it went back into the

00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:35,150
license pool and then that got license

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,620
to like dozens and dozens other

00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,940
manufacturers and be it was just like

00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,500
killed by that right so at the end of

00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,660
the day you can be a really big

00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,490
corporation with a lot of like insight

00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,230
and a lot of marketing a lot of push to

00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,400
get maybe do your b2b initiatives

00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,840
because you know one customer you can

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,160
you know them really well but knowing

00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,260
the consumer market knowing that

00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,460
tv-b-gone is going to be a thing that

00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,020
people are actually gonna want is not

00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,730
something that's obvious so having this

00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,800
open conversation and be able to get

00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,690
that validation early on build the

00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,100
community and have the community make

00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,660
improvements check them back from their

00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,920
base and then build them out further is

00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,190
like a really important part of that

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,190
process

00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:26,260
so I think we're at the end of the of

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,880
the panel and so initially the idea was

00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,470
that we share about the future but I

00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,960
think we already shared about the future

00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:37,540
we we see in what direction we are

00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:39,820
heading in on all sides yeah but we have

00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:43,750
still three minutes and I would like to

00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:48,880
open the floor to a question here from

00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:53,790
the audience if there if there are

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,790
questions yes sherry okay

00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:10,070
hello is this open-source okay so thank

00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:15,300
you it's been a very interesting panel

00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:18,840
now what what I've been seeing as a

00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,520
trend right is that yes some things are

00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,680
getting more and more open right we have

00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,190
open source Linux getting embraced by

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,590
[Music]

00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:31,110
big companies IBM Microsoft etcetera

00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:35,580
etcetera but at the same time I feel

00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:36,870
that it's it's I don't know if it's just

00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,300
me but I feel that it's getting almost

00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:42,170
schizophrenic right because on one hand

00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:46,620
we have like these that they're getting

00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:49,410
embraced and open-source being being

00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,390
embraced and on the other has on the

00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:53,850
other side we have cloud providers which

00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:58,740
are creating closed ecosystems and and

00:50:53,850 --> 00:51:01,830
patents and even companies like Facebook

00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,350
which are completely closed but actively

00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:06,780
involved in open so I'm wondering is is

00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:09,690
the net result are we getting more open

00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:13,290
or or is it actually a red herring where

00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:15,240
where the openness is hiding the fact

00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:19,920
that we are all getting driven into a

00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:25,290
closed ecosystem that we will be very

00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,970
difficult to come out of any takers okay

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,220
I think there is an interesting sort of

00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:30,960
you bring up a good point and there's an

00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,730
interesting question it's gonna come up

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,070
in terms of the algorithms versus the

00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:38,880
data particularly machine learning the

00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:40,410
actual like code that runs the models

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,900
and inference engine is not as variable

00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:44,640
as the data sets themselves right and so

00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,020
you can have open license code and we

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,880
can all fork it all sort of stuff but

00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,220
you can't get access to the massive data

00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,270
sets to train these engines it's going

00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,430
to be worthless right and so there's

00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:55,590
there is a bit of a danger that we are

00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,390
walking into and also you can have

00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,100
plenty of open source infrastructure but

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,690
then the user accounts and the data

00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,010
that's inside the cloud inside Google

00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,510
Drive whatever is really where where

00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:08,040
it's at you know and these are these are

00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:09,810
the real things and so and so as a

00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:13,230
kind of a community you do bring up a

00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:16,440
very big concern that I have is that

00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,119
maybe we are just playing into some

00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,590
larger corporate strategy to just

00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,330
leverage our ability to help build up

00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,820
their war chest and they just accumulate

00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:25,020
data users and they just put a different

00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,550
license on something's that's not

00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,990
functional through a sort of a quirk of

00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,520
the system and then we end up

00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,500
essentially weaponizing an ecosystem

00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,720
that we're hoping to demilitarize at the

00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:39,359
end of the day okay can I make a comment

00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:44,100
- I there a very good point and my I I

00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:45,960
think I am optimistic that as I said you

00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:49,890
know open source will win out in the end

00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,650
and we are moving in very very strongly

00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,450
at the moment in the right direction for

00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,670
my future forward-looking bit I was

00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,470
going to say that open is really really

00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:02,070
important

00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:04,710
but privacy is also very very important

00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:07,140
and at the moment we're going through a

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,660
phase where we've got companies

00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:13,410
collecting massive amounts of data

00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:16,020
centrally we're building massive machine

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:18,750
learning models we're spending weeks and

00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:25,320
weeks of multiple GPUs to build these

00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:28,020
models and that that's where the power

00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:30,750
kind of lies at the moment I think we're

00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:33,150
slowly starting to see the pendulum

00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,790
swinging with regard to privacy back

00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,470
into the right direction to regain our

00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,950
privacy and it's great to see Tim

00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:45,590
berners-lee's project around regaining

00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:50,430
privacy and regaining the internet but

00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:53,970
the the models that we spend hours

00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:56,820
building we are also now starting to try

00:53:53,970 --> 00:54:03,300
and share that as well so our computer

00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:06,090
vision models we saw the the IBM AI what

00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,550
was the called day I put an area to

00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:10,980
publish AI models we're developing

00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:13,530
similar stuff that publishing pre-built

00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,080
AI models and to try and share that

00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:18,420
openly so doing the outcomes as well as

00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:24,599
the open source that drives those

00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:30,059
yes outcomes yeah it's a big one racing

00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:32,490
I represent a corporation you know from

00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:34,200
IBM perspective right I think what

00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,480
programming perspective is that you know

00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,930
what sauce like you said right it's it's

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,750
it is the future right and companies

00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:51,079
like IBM look at our open source as a

00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:53,190
future for ourselves as well and so the

00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,960
if you look at all the platforms that

00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,740
mansion right because it's cloud or AI a

00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:02,579
blockchain a quantum right everything is

00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:05,190
based on open source or open technology

00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:08,780
right and this is a core part of

00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:12,390
strategy it is fundamental to IBM's

00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:15,569
innovation right and I think that alone

00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:18,150
tells you that you know when you look at

00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:20,390
open source most organizations when you

00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:25,079
look at the core platform the plumbing

00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:27,690
is where I think it's also big where ivn

00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,910
comes in and where we you know try to

00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:33,079
add value this other place the

00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:35,190
peripherals where we had the last mile

00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,290
incorporate the last mile capabilities

00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,470
around what an enterprise needs right

00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:42,059
from a scalability of an availability

00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:46,109
reliable but it's perspective that's

00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:48,780
where we add the value right but the

00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:52,999
core of it right it is going to be open

00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:57,150
source in the future I believe that

00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:59,069
okay this is the future its we hope it

00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:01,619
will go in this direction it all looks

00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:05,339
like it that like we'll find out right

00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:07,259
the future is arriving so and I would

00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:09,920
like to say I think there are many more

00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:12,930
people who would like to talk to you so

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,039
will you be staying here for a few a

00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,529
little bit more time so people have

00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,130
questions they can also come to you I'll

00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:22,529
hook you here anyways I guess right

00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:25,589
Graham you have a talk also in the AI

00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:29,160
track yeah so you'll be available for

00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:31,440
further discussions M and Carsten you

00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,930
will also be here in giving a talk in

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,729
the hardware track on Saturday as well

00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,769
as bunny we'll see you again in the

00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:40,609
hardware track so more opportunities to

00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:42,420
catch up and get together him I think we

00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:44,430
couldn't answer all the questions

00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,200
there's much more as always write about

00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,089
it was very very interesting here it was

00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:51,119
very nice panel so thank you very much

00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:51,820
to all the panelists and thank you very

00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:58,539
much for joining us

00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:58,539
