The theme of the FOSSASIA Summit 2019 is "The Future is FOSS". FOSS - Free and Open Source Software stands more and more for Free and Open Source Solutions. At FOSSASIA we are not only developing software, but also hardware, content and complete solutions following a model of free and open development. But, is the Future indeed FOSS? Is FOSS mainstream already in many areas and does it mean it will be also mainstream in other areas? Is it possible that trends also go in another direction where developers follow a more closed source approach in some areas again? What opportunities do really exist in other areas like hardware? In this panel we hope to get ideas for answers from our panelists.
