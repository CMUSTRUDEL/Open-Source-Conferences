Title: The Future Is FOSS! ? Panel
Publication date: 2019-03-31
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Open Data, Internet, Community
Description: 
	15 March 2019 17:10, Lecture Theatre

In the Panel: Davide Storti, Michael Ducy, Jonas von Malottki, Michael Downey, Marian Marinov, Anjali Curic

The theme of the FOSSASIA Summit 2019 is "The Future is FOSS". FOSS - Free and Open Source Software stands more and more for Free and Open Source Solutions. At FOSSASIA we are not only developing software, but also hardware, content and complete solutions following a model of free and open development. But, is the Future indeed FOSS? Is FOSS mainstream already in many areas and does it mean it will be also mainstream in other areas? Is it possible that trends also go in another direction where developers follow a more closed source approach in some areas again? What opportunities do really exist in other areas like hardware? In this panel we hope to get ideas for answers from our panelists.

development public speaking and

00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:22,079
programming so let's talk a little bit

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,459
about the future we have all gathered

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,799
here to kind of talk about what the role

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,389
of open sources and I want to start with

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,940
the past a little bit and I'm gonna ask

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,470
everyone I'm gonna ask a few key people

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,660
each of these three questions so we're

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,859
gonna talk about the past

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,389
kind of the current and some of the

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,310
current issues then we're gonna go into

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,849
the future so I'll call you out by name

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,290
and try to limit your responses to no

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,519
more than two or three minutes each so

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,250
we can kind of keep things moving and

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,310
get out of here on time so the first

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,549
question I'm gonna pitch to both Michael

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,840
and Marian may be to start and for those

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,269
of you who are here this morning you

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,700
heard some talk about over the past few

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,129
months how there's been some noise and

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,799
coverage in the news about companies and

00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:08,010
and different organizations and looks

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,260
like we need the yellow micron good so

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,060
we've heard some news about

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,949
organizations and companies really

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,010
concerned that maybe this open source

00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,780
thing isn't great for keeping their

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,359
revenue coming keeping money coming into

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,710
the company over the long term and

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,539
they've been struggling with what they

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,910
call sustainable business models and

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,590
there's been some gripes that the Kerr

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,040
open-source licenses that are out there

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,930
have actually are broken according to

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,970
some people and we need to do some

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,730
reinvention of what open-source means

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,530
for some of these companies so I want to

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,140
ask the two of you and others of you if

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,540
you feel strongly about this if you feel

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,760
that that fuss is indeed broken right

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,170
now and need some reinvention or do we

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,170
just need maybe some more creative

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,140
thinking from other areas about how to

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,120
sustain financial resources for

00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,950
organizations maybe new business models

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,580
for people who use free and open source

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,810
software to innovate technology and then

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,840
finally do you think that there's any

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,180
value in having continuing to have these

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,580
agreed standard definitions like what

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,190
the open source initiative has for the

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,600
open source definition saying an open

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,070
source license must be all of these

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,420
different things do you think that's

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,370
still valuable as we look toward the

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,040
future do we need to think differently

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,620
about what open source means and how

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,350
people can create business opportunities

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:35,730
with open source many thoughts that was

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:39,300
that was a lot so go into the kind of

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:42,660
current issue of what we've seen with

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,580
Redis and then recently with elastic and

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,080
then changing licensing models and

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,050
trying to come up with licensing models

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,870
that kind of protect their revenue I

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,300
think part of the problem is is the idea

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,030
of creating a sustainable company has

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,530
changed greatly than what it used to be

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,180
you know if you told someone if they

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,230
were going to open a small business that

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,180
was a 4050 million dollar small business

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,630
and that was your yearly revenues you

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,890
would be an extremely successful small

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,169
business owner right or even

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,450
medium-sized business owner and now

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,600
that's no longer good enough and that's

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,970
mainly no longer good enough because as

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,390
soon as you start taking venture capital

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,040
you're no longer beholding to your users

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,900
you're beholding to your investors and

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,669
that changes the relationship and and

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,200
that's why you see companies that are

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,430
going through these licensing changes to

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,600
kind of protect their bottom line and

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,630
protect protect their revenue

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,970
open-source business models are

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,790
and I doesn't feel like anyone's really

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,590
gotten it right except Red Hat and they

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,720
did for a really really long time of

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,120
taking that support model but you know

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,440
should we forget you know what Red Hat

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,990
went through 12 years ago when they

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,090
closed all their binaries off and made

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,620
all the binaries be something that you

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,900
had to purchase and the open-source

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,470
communities found ways around it with

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,960
projects such as Fedora and CentOS and

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,420
now they've kind of pulled those those

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,750
projects back in right as being a core

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,820
component so I think we do need to

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,430
relook at what those business models are

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,140
I probably don't have an answer off the

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,020
top of my head of one that works but I

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,850
also I think we just maybe need to calm

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,820
down and not everyone needs to have a

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,010
billion dollar acquisition and can we

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,680
just build sustainable companies that

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,930
are sustainable companies and not the

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,790
constant silicon silicon valley you know

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:44,470
corn I would add that without

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,140
open-source licensing that we currently

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,940
have we wouldn't have the service

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,210
companies that we currently have because

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,880
every service company is sitting on top

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,180
of a lot of open source software and

00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,030
without that you wouldn't have anything

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,830
you wouldn't have the cloud and it's not

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,340
possible to actually go there without

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:10,000
all this software no single company

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:13,000
whatever the size of it is cannot build

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,040
all this tech and support all the stacks

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,360
without the open source community yeah

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,050
and I think the other thing I would add

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,790
to that is you know let's not sit here

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,070
and pretend that they're all altruistic

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,180
and their motives behind why their can

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,010
starting to contribute to these

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,140
open-source projects they've changed

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,970
their business models to where they need

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,830
to drive compute consumption and that's

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,140
how they make money and therefore

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,090
creating healthy projects that can drive

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,490
compute consumption is where their

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:42,250
business model is yeah essentially and I

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,920
want to add for the licensing and the

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,840
standards without standards we wouldn't

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,960
have the internet internet started with

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,810
different standards and when Ethernet

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,150
became the standard then in the internet

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,330
was actually built

00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:00,780
and start growing so in such pace that

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:03,570
we see now without good standards that

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,270
our one single standard agreed upon

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:10,740
between different companies we wouldn't

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:13,200
be able to communicate easily yeah I

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,770
think we have to look at many of those

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,290
of those areas now first of all one that

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,230
there's the sentence from IETF as one of

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,240
my favorite ones we don't believe in

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,640
kings and queens and presidents we only

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,940
believe in running rough consensus and

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,800
running code yeah so and I think that's

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,330
also how the standards of the futures

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,730
are being made and you can see that if

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,400
you look at licensees what kind of

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,980
licenses are most used on github at

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,440
least yeah that's MIT yeah

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,270
and it's good to have a standards

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,640
organization that says yeah this is a

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:56,820
free and open-source software license

00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,090
like the OSI license and that's very

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,130
important because if you are disputing

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:06,900
you always want to look somewhere where

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:09,990
you have some standards furthermore if

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,900
you think about how do the open source

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,850
world how does it change and are like

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,520
MongoDB and so on aggressive with

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,660
licensees and stuff like this yeah let's

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,390
not forget that

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,390
a lot of the the business which is

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,460
currently running has not been made real

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,430
contact or with the open source world

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,320
yeah so this is maybe a leet problem

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,040
here but people discussing that and

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,550
understanding that I work for a company

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,520
that has been transforming materials to

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:46,650
cars yeah and selling them luxury cars

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,530
am i serious and nowadays in the older

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,840
times the car was just it was just

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,740
hardware and nowadays it's hardware and

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,380
software and you cannot build anything

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,730
without the right software on it yeah

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,520
like so and the question is with Daimler

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,260
and foster so what were we doing with it

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,960
and I think there will be a lot of

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,700
company

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,230
that go through the same process as we

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:17,920
are currently meaning opening up to save

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,410
yourselves because those googles and

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,660
everything they were born in that space

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,570
yeah Microsoft made a quite nice

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,620
transition to that yeah in some extent

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:33,310
yeah but a lot of businesses have they

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:36,850
have no clue about software and so no

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,150
clue about open software and that is I

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,100
think a step witches are going to follow

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,350
and the question is what's your business

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,840
model behind that and the business model

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,450
transforming something into something

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,850
else will always be there yeah it's a

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,990
very abstract but usually I mean just

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,640
packaging water huh it's a business yeah

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,690
going to Starbucks and getting a coffee

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,010
you can do it at home it's a business so

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,350
this kind of business will always be

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,900
there and the question is how do they

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,870
transform also with software or to

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,780
software you're reminding me of a

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,580
challenge that people in my world which

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,820
are nonprofits and government

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,200
organizations struggle with what can we

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,350
learn from the other people who are a

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,210
few steps ahead of us who trust ruggle

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,650
with some of these problems already so

00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,040
what I'm hearing from all of you are a

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,540
few things that are key I think is a

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,240
we've still got to work together and

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,850
collaborate with each other and learn

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,540
from each other but to do so in with a

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,130
spirit of openness and authenticity and

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,130
people know that people may have other

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,360
motives besides just collaboration and

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,860
I'm reminded that there are some really

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,990
good organizations out there that I

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,820
think we need to invest our energy and

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,830
and supporting or creating more of them

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,990
there's an organization called a to do

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,140
group which is for companies that have

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,280
focus on open source technology where

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,370
those business people can learn from

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,900
each other and share ideas as well as

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,400
the open source initiative I'm hearing

00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,350
several of you say that it's still

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,380
important for there to be a community

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,450
group that defines what does it mean for

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,520
us to share our technology with each

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,380
other be those open source licenses or

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,910
other things so we should try to find

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,279
those types of organizations embraced

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,740
and join them if they have membership or

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,839
and be a part of them when we can so

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,709
thank you appreciate that I want to take

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,620
us now to the near term future I think

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,810
it's the best way to say it in your

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,699
comments about automobiles reminds me

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,970
that we've seen the lines between

00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:42,790
hardware and software get more blurry in

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,889
the last several years now we've got you

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,809
know open source software specifically

00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,490
and everything from cars to obviously

00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:51,819
our smartphones and our kitchen

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,439
appliances now very commonly but more

00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:55,269
recently and just in the last couple

00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:59,110
years we've started to hear people voice

00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:01,420
more and more concern about how the data

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,579
that these these gadgets are collecting

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,319
how is that information used and maybe

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,899
it's it's great to get something really

00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,579
useful out of it you know to begin with

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,860
but what happens when more and more of

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:14,920
your data becomes stored in in the cloud

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,850
and with these organizations and so

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,499
we've heard a lot of calls that

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,620
something needs to be done about those

00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:24,459
risks and just in the fast in the past

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,589
week we saw some tweets about the SUSE

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,730
AI smart speakers I think we're going to

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,370
be hearing about those over the next

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,899
couple days where the FASTA community

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,240
has actually built software and hardware

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,790
to kind of compete with this and offer

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,250
an alternative model so maybe I'll ask

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,680
both Davide and and Jonas at least to

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,199
think about this and talk a little bit

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,559
about how organizations that are

00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,899
building devices or services that just

00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,399
regular people use how can those

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,079
organizations and people who are

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,730
building those things how can they earn

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,309
the trust of the people using the

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,470
technology and help them understand that

00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:00,160
their data will be used responsibly over

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,559
the long term

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,309
and does open-source software have a

00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,259
role to play in that trust not only

00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:10,839
open-source software but maybe open data

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,370
licenses and other issues any thoughts

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,550
Jonah since you have the mic to start

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,480
with oh yeah certainly I mean this this

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,050
is a hard a big problem to solve and

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,689
it's necessary to solve it I mean in

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:29,379
Europe at least we have now the GDP RS

00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:32,529
or general data protection laws that

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,200
make it yeah let's say it easier for

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,480
people like me who are conscious about

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,800
what kind of data they produce to

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,290
inquiry to the companies how the data is

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,150
used there now and you have the right to

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,790
be forgotten and a lot of other things

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,860
as well there so at least that is one

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,140
part legislation is a very important

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,570
part of how to deal with data the

00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,640
consciousness of that you're producing

00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,650
data all day and that you're consuming

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,960
data all day is very important yeah and

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,020
that is something which is a I don't

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,690
think problem for anybody who's here but

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,760
a problem for the general user often

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,830
yeah they're certainly surprised

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,700
wow this data is there Wow unbelievable

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,290
and then secondly or thirdly you need

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,880
this kind of data also for different

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,370
kinds of business models and it's it's

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,860
not always bad to have this data yeah

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,780
but how can we use it and I think you

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,180
already made a point there

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,930
open-source plays a very important role

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,440
and maybe also open data access and in

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,600
the GDP are there is the send the the

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,360
line that you have to make it exportable

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,020
to some format yeah and there's already

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,570
helps if you know what kind of data do

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:50,170
you have in there and the next question

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:53,770
is sure we have to improve on that the

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,930
the open source also gives you benefits

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,060
in terms of that because if you know how

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:03,490
your data is processed yeah that can

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:05,920
give you some trust yeah but it still if

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,740
you don't stored the data right on the

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,800
right place it can be misused yeah and

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,820
if it's ones out it's a way so the topic

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,709
we saw before if the security is also

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,110
very important so there are multiple

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:23,530
steps that you have to be conscious

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:27,610
secure the data and be open with it but

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,920
not allowed to to code wild domini I

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,050
wonder if you can respond to that with a

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,420
different lens and that is how

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,540
technology is often used in the

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,680
developing world or countries where they

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,070
may have people coming in with

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:46,180
technology from the outside and how they

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:49,460
perceive the notion if they do at all of

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,679
this idea of owning their own data

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,690
and what do people struggle with on both

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,919
sides of that equation but the people

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,110
using with technology and the people

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,390
building it what do they need to

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:06,950
consider in terms of the people who are

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:11,510
ultimately using the tech now well I

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:14,710
think in general of course the I mean

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:17,059
observation is that when technology is

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,840
exported particularly in developing

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,860
countries

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:26,600
that's not badly perceived I mean it's

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,610
rather perceived as an opportunity to to

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,730
to jump off or beast for business for a

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:34,250
full job creation things like that but

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,460
at the same time you know the process

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:41,059
that was put in place in Europe before

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:45,350
the GDP are is long and I think this is

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:50,600
the only way that you may really respond

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:54,860
to these kind of needs and it and it's

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,770
very complicated because it's typically

00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,039
the response of the policy which happens

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,350
when when a bit later when things

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,480
already happened so there's I think

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,030
there's a lot to learn also from from

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:13,669
countries that are not they don't have

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,350
this kind of policies to learn that

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,159
above just wrote a process that had been

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:23,780
going on because then when policy moves

00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:25,490
they may be very you know like an

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,039
elephant in the in the room in the sense

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,220
that for example we saw in switch into

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:34,280
the open source we saw the debate on the

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,730
reform of copyright which was know on

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:42,190
the copyright for authors like no books

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:44,750
or other things and then with without

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,230
even thinking about that this was

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,630
actually hitting very hard still in

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,990
Europe mussoorie hit him very hard the

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:58,159
software world because the wording that

00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:02,130
was used denoted a complete means known

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:05,100
awareness about the software as a

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,789
part of the creation process as a part

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,919
of the industry process as a part of the

00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:12,870
element of the equation and this is what

00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,429
is a very complained recomputed so I

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:19,049
think the response from organizations

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:22,080
from also the community is really to

00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:24,660
push for a we're raising it's a it's a

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,510
long process but it's a only through

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,940
this that you may hope that the policy

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,429
process really takes time it takes the

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,309
place in a reasonable time and with the

00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:38,940
without without creating you know

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,860
problems more than solving them thank

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,900
you and Anjali you've got the microphone

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,440
I'm wondering especially as a younger

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,270
person if you have any ideas about all

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,370
of this information that we're we're

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,210
sharing through social media everything

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:56,789
else do you have thoughts on what it

00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,390
means to trust others with with our data

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:03,179
over time yes I do

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,980
I don't use social media much but I've

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,289
heard of cases when there's data

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,539
stealing on social media and I think

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:12,390
it'll be good if the social media plan

00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,250
that films can be made open source so

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,280
people can look into the backend and see

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:20,730
the data apart from social media there

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,250
are cases with AI for example I've been

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,130
working on a lot of AI projects there

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,770
side so and there's this one called

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,590
mercury which is a sign language

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,780
translator and for that it needs to take

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:37,020
images of the user sometimes of your

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,490
face and with that there's a problem for

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,020
the user because they want to see where

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,120
your data is going whether we are you

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,990
saving it for something that's not

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:50,429
really great so I think mercury is also

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:52,980
open source now right good so quickly

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,140
recapping that I'm hearing again the the

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,580
call for working with each other to

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,770
learn from what other people have

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,840
experienced sometimes people are a few

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,700
steps ahead and we can we can learn from

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,090
that and adapt it and again for

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,700
transparency ultimately being so

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,770
critical and not even even if we don't

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,960
take the take the incentive to go and

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,140
look at the code you know it goes back

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,559
to the old leanness is law

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,850
of many eyes make all bugs shallow right

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,360
the more people who are able to see

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,940
things

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,700
the stronger the stuff that we built can

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,070
be over time so thank you I want to take

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,240
the last question here both Anjali and

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,659
to Davide

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,460
to think more about the future now but

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:36,860
to talk about the future I want to say

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,320
just a quick word about the past so if

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,029
you look at the history of Technology as

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,429
we think about it at the UN foundation

00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:45,440
there's kind of three phases when you

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,179
start using technology to solve a

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,279
problem the first phase is where you

00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,690
have someone from the outside kind of

00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,059
dropping something in front of you and

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:56,840
saying here use this we think this is

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:59,750
going to be great for you enjoy and then

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,960
the second phase we move to this era

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,120
where we had what's often called user

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,610
centered design where you design for

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,970
specific use cases you try to understand

00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:12,679
how people want to use the technology

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,539
and you try to bring them in and ask

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,419
questions about how they're doing using

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:20,059
that technology and then the third phase

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:22,220
which is where we are now is you

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,350
actually build platforms for people to

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,210
create their own solutions to problems

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,840
and this is now where we get into the

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,309
age of social networking we you have

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,929
these platforms where people can do

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,480
their own coding and deploy their own

00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,880
apps very easily the github x' and the

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,159
get labs of the world so question for

00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,730
both of you as we look into the future

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,450
now do you think it's more likely that

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:49,549
people will will stick with this kind of

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,980
structured role where you have something

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,750
like Facebook or Twitter and you have to

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,970
you have to create within their

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,370
boundaries or Instagram even where

00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,779
you're welcome to create and express

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,149
yourself to the world but you do it

00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,970
within their rules right or do you think

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:07,610
what the the future really holds are

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,880
more on tools like like get lab or

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,159
glitch comm if you know about that or

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,570
other types of online maker spaces where

00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,899
people can actually create their own

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,909
solutions to problems do you think one

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:21,769
will prevail or the other one will be

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:24,440
more more popular in the long term and

00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:25,149
then do you think that open source has a

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,969
role to

00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,889
play and either one of those whichever

00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:32,619
you think is more likely so on Julia

00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:36,940
we'll start with you oh that's a big

00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:40,059
load of questions so um well your first

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,099
point the three stages but somebody jobs

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:44,049
a product in front of you where the

00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:46,509
developer makes a user-centered product

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:49,659
and where there's a platform for users

00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:52,389
to create their own product the first

00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:54,639
stage I think that's not exactly false

00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:57,099
products so-called that's usually

00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:58,419
something like PowerPoint someday jobs a

00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:01,839
product in front of your face and says

00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:03,669
use this but for false products the main

00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,379
reason why people use them is because

00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:08,440
they are accessible developers put them

00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:11,729
up all over the pages let s get as many

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:17,320
outreach as possible and people use it

00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:19,210
and the third street there's a platform

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,749
like that it's where I started coding

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,179
and it's called scratch and its users

00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:27,820
block based programming language and a

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:32,589
lot of young kids start by using scratch

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:35,830
and in scratch it follows stuff you know

00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:38,799
Apple has this analogy for music it goes

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,639
create rip mix burn I think you'd have

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,460
heard about it

00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:45,879
yep so scratch kind of follows this

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,429
analogy it allows users kids like us to

00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:49,960
create our own projects it allows us to

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,999
rip off code from other people's

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,509
projects in the big world this would be

00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:57,460
called an API yeah it allows us to rip

00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:00,039
off code and use it in our own project

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,109
it allows us to remake someone else's

00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,389
project and it allows us to burn our

00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:08,950
projects or to publish it to the scratch

00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:11,830
community so what all these stages be

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:19,299
put together that's your question to

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:21,729
each stages well yes and no but second

00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:24,759
two stages these are false products

00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:26,589
they'll definitely be put together but

00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,339
the first stage I'm not so sure about

00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:30,359
that

00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:30,359
maybe midnight

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:40,420
I think you know damn well I think first

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,880
of all decimated from the end of your

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:46,090
question because also we use just

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:51,700
scratch a lot in all this some exercises

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:54,460
we do but the purpose is not to write

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,860
software in a closed environment I think

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,500
this is something which I you know

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,570
really personally is right to fight with

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,900
all means because that's not the purpose

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:06,970
the purpose is to learn and use this

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,610
terminology female the feminine energies

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,660
of learning how to fish so that you know

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:18,240
you can you can eat every day so the

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:21,720
thing is working on a closed environment

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,610
should not be taught it as a limitation

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,470
because of course you may learn to learn

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,820
in a closed environment because we want

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,270
to learn scratch you want to learn on

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,809
other tools etc on Facebook apps but at

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:37,390
every day if you learn the right way

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:39,520
then you are free because actually you

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,890
learn the process you learn that you can

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,260
do it and this is what the programming

00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,210
should be and this is where I was

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,470
talking about being creative and being

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,910
so I think we should look at positively

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,740
of course there are many negative

00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,750
science as well because of course the

00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:00,040
industries may be pushing towards these

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:03,460
streams of closed environments because

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,520
that's what business that's normal but

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,230
the same time we should try to continue

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,200
to push the other way around and the

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:14,620
community of developers is big is

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,559
drawing really there are many developers

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,260
or the world and so I mean things we

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,120
cannot be just dream like I don't

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,870
believe that it will happen like this I

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,360
think at some point some other group

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,000
will emerge with a new thing and things

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,830
will not be confined in that so and I

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,260
think that you know what she's

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,380
completely right she I think she she

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,429
knows it's ready can I pinch in here

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,850
yeah sure

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:45,360
one of the biggest users of

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:48,380
software is government's and what I see

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,820
is that governments will change and

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,190
every software that they commissioned

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,350
should become open-source I don't know

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,320
if you guys know but Bulgaria is the

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:01,470
only country in the world that has a law

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,390
that says every software that is written

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:07,410
with public money should be open-source

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:10,400
software and this may be holding the

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:14,250
future of open source because now

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,470
programmers we would not only program

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:19,350
for ourselves for our Faust projects but

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:22,620
we could actually influence how our

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,820
governments working or how the work is

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:29,809
actually done inside our governments so

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:33,360
forcing this way can benefit everyone if

00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:36,140
your money your taxpayer money are going

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,390
to private companies that are building

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:43,890
Faust projects we would get even better

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:46,400
first project yeah agreed and and for

00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:50,730
those of you either watching online or

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:52,559
have a laptop go to public Cody you the

00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,240
Free Software Foundation and Europe has

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,700
a great campaign about this very topic

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,500
and tells you why that's so important so

00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,880
we're almost out of time and I wish I

00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,650
could stay here all night with all of

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,400
you because you're so awesome and and

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,020
inspiring but what we're going to do to

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,210
kind of advertise what your interests

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,490
are and we have three more days of the

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,559
conference after today but I'm gonna go

00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,540
around is straight down the line and I

00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,210
wouldn't ask you all the same question

00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,920
and and and here's the deal the people

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,400
out in the audience here and the people

00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,960
watching at home on YouTube are super

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,870
smart they are the people who are going

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,240
to be building the future right for many

00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,130
of us you know we're we're kind of

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,950
coasting down we have a lot of young

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:38,340
people here and so I guess the question

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,250
for each of you is what one piece of

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,750
advice would you give the people

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,179
watching and watching us discuss here or

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:48,240
or would you ask them maybe a question

00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:51,040
to kind of spark some innovation in

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,720
their minds to result

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,280
ultimately in the future that we all

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,380
want to see I think we all have a vision

00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,720
of the future we'd like and we all have

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,500
an idea of how how fast can be involved

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,929
in that so pose a question or offer some

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,720
advice to the people out there and one

00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:14,460
one or two sentences maximum the other

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:17,620
day win the prize for the most great

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:21,790
advice I think already is my advice

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:24,790
really believe in it and use openness at

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:27,880
the right way and and we know the better

00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:31,410
future will be better the question is

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:34,480
are you ready to make it so basically

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,890
what are you going to make it as an

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,169
individual to participate in the

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:43,059
community so that's a bit my main

00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:45,610
question I would say that at most force

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:48,190
conferences that I visit I speak with a

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,230
lot of people that have their own own

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,260
projects home project for the car or

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:56,290
something but they don't share these

00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,570
projects so push those projects that's

00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,330
our license that you like an open-source

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:05,559
license and push them share it and share

00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,530
these projects with everyone and this

00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,890
way anyone else that is working on

00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,020
projects Americ users can cooperate with

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,440
you or you could actually help them

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,440
their project to start working actually

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,020
you know we talk a lot at least in the

00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,880
u.s. tech community in New York to an

00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,559
extent as well I'm not sure too much in

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,600
Asia well we talked a lot about

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:37,929
diversity and inclusion and other ideas

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,570
like that and I think the next

00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:43,080
generation is getting exposed to it in a

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,340
much different conversation than I did

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,380
but I think one of the Power more

00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,940
powerful things that I think about like

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,169
my journey through open source is that

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,169
when you're interacting with somebody

00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:55,510
online and on a mailing list you're like

00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:58,150
you have no idea about their

00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,520
socioeconomic status the color of their

00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,919
skin where they're from what languages

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,150
they speak well maybe but all those

00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,010
things kind of

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,750
erased and we're just two people having

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:11,920
a conversation about trying to solve a

00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:14,710
software problem and I like that idea

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,750
and I think as the next generation comes

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,250
up these problems are going to get

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,350
better but who always need to be

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:23,380
remembered of like when it comes down to

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,270
technology we're all just saying humans

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,820
trying to save this to saw solve the

00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:30,010
same problems and keeping that in mind

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,660
to work together and make the world a

00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,630
more welcoming place as the advice I

00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,970
would give

00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:40,750
so maybe my advice but that's just my

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:43,210
personal thinking yeah it's what I would

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,970
really like to see is education more

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,720
education yeah and I mean that in both

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:52,480
ways meaning that not to only teach kids

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,090
how to to code and and you scratch and

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,930
be even a programmer or advance and open

00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:02,950
source but also teach society something

00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:06,340
about that topic from below to the up

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,680
yeah because I have several concerns

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:13,000
with also legislation currently running

00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:16,960
in Europe or Society status for the one

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,480
thing I liked your analogy but in the

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,770
end technology might be one of the

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,250
problems over in there

00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:28,930
and I have let's say how can we retain

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:31,990
the force and the freedom not free as

00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:35,230
free beer but the freedom how can we

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:39,640
retain the freedom because in several

00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:43,390
countries those kind of people how they

00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,850
rule at least to my personal belief are

00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,370
concerning and so I would like to see

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,830
more of those graters and so on on other

00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:53,740
countries to step in for something that

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,870
they like and once you have hit that the

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:58,030
world of working then it might get

00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,880
difficult because you are so indulged in

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,960
other topics and so I would that's my

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,960
advice or my wish

00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,850
since I'm tired of the future this

00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,060
advise applies to me as well no Jesse

00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:17,770
you so it goes like this

00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:19,750
follow the ABC aspire dream dream big

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:23,320
dream until your head bust and all your

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:26,320
thoughts flow out of your head descends

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:31,240
for be curious sorry I got the wrong one

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,270
be brief go off try every single idea

00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,380
don't hesitate at all and see sense for

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,040
be curious just think every day when you

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,890
come home

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,300
ask yourself what have I learned today

00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:50,530
what the new and why is this like this

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:53,110
can it change can I change it great

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,760
think thank you on and on Julia you just

00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,700
reminded me of a quote that we like to

00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,180
talk about at my office at the UN

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,890
Foundation there's a person from World

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,020
War two named Anne Frank from

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:08,200
Netherlands and one of the things that

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,780
she wrote and her famous diary was how

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,760
wonderful it is to know that nobody need

00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,190
wait a single moment to make the world a

00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,130
better place and it's it's all about

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,230
getting up and going out there we've

00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,040
built a lot of the tools that can start

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,020
to make that happen

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,580
we need to stand together and what we've

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,430
heard through all of these comments is

00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,440
we're stronger when we work together so

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,869
find people who align with your values

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,730
and your vision about the future and go

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:35,770
for it so thank you all for your

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,080
comments today I don't know do we have

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:41,170
any time for questions are we at the at

00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:45,160
a cut-off time okay so two questions

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:47,800
anyone from the audience do we have a

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,760
okay so I guess just stand up and be

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,760
loud and I'll repeat the question

00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,860
yeah we're really short on time I guess

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,870
maybe maybe I'll say this and for those

00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,380
of you on the video valide can you speak

00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:07,050
a little bit more about where we see the

00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,320
gender gap between maybe the education

00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:12,090
system and then the actual the industry

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:22,230
are the people actually doing technology

00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:24,480
work yes true quick so I mean of course

00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:28,800
yeah this is a gender gap this is

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,970
unfortunately in general worldwide true

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,590
now there are countries where these

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,010
sometimes any proportions are reversed

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,300
but this is not in many places

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:44,150
unfortunately now therefore the fact

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:49,050
that of course people make choices for

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:51,720
no studies or things or the future

00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:56,630
that's true but this is also true that

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:59,580
there is a society around which is

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:03,350
consciously or not consciously pushing

00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:09,600
towards people towards a certain kind of

00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:15,570
directions so we have a lot of biases in

00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:19,680
say or in in people's lives from from

00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:23,310
very young age that may apply may

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,620
influence choices later on so in general

00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,800
unfortunately and there are not many

00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,940
data actually on the on the software on

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,360
software development

00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:38,060
it's really low it's something like 20%

00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:41,460
of women in the in the rest a worldwide

00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:43,590
in this in this the latest data which

00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,740
are very variable for the free open

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:50,010
source but these were few years ago was

00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,530
as low as 2 or 3 percent now this movie

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,330
was maybe a few years ago maybe now now

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,710
it's it's certainly improved I guess I

00:39:54,330 --> 00:40:02,220
hope but

00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:06,039
it means there is a many places a

00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:08,890
blatent gender gap in the coastal

00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:13,569
communities maybe not here in the in

00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:16,539
this country and also the fact that one

00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:19,720
of the remedy which is taken is many

00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,609
times to do things only for girls so

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,260
there are many projects also we do and

00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:25,809
which is not probably the best

00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:29,380
approaches to is to develop projects

00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:37,289
that are exactly bringing more girls

00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:41,920
into the computer science less a job or

00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:45,190
and and it may be a solution in some

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,039
places because actually otherwise the

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:51,849
girls would not do it if men would be

00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:54,579
less a part of it but at the same time

00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,410
it may be not really closing the gap

00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:59,170
because you are creating more divide in

00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,660
the sense that what what will be best is

00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:06,819
to have a full inclusion and the people

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:09,910
work together all of us so I don't think

00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:14,289
that I can be very exhaustive we can

00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:16,960
talk later about this but certainly yes

00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:21,339
there is a gender gap second that the

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,430
choice is not under certain we cannot

00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:26,650
really say that the choices are really

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:30,460
autonomous because we are guided into

00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,690
discovering things to ours our lives and

00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:36,490
in some places there are more

00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:39,430
opportunities than others and then but

00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:43,500
also when there is a counseling of

00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:46,000
teachers like you are very important in

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:50,710
pushing people towards making some

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,210
choices and so I'm happy to hear that in

00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:57,700
this in this case it's not a problem

00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:00,730
I'm helping organizing rails girls

00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,190
events in Bulgaria and what I hear from

00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,390
the girls is that the IT environment is

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:10,310
hostile environment for a girl

00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:17,780
it's like you're making a miner from a

00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:24,290
girl very intensive heavily heavy job

00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:26,810
that is primary men are working there in

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:30,890
IT you have the same thing even though

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:34,700
it's not so heavy as a job but the

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:37,880
community actually the men inside the IT

00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:40,250
are pushing out the girls they are not

00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,090
including them this is a big issue

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:47,120
because yeah she may have finished a PhD

00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:50,120
in computer science they still won't

00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:54,260
believe that this code would work and

00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:56,570
this is something that we don't need to

00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:01,460
teach only the women we actually have to

00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:03,220
teach the men that this code works no

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,160
matter what's the gender of the person

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,420
if it works it works you don't care what

00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,650
who wrote it

00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:15,470
what wrote it yeah sorry good Michael I

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,130
just add one thing even if you're in a

00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:22,340
you look at an industry and you see a

00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:26,120
perfect 50/50 split between male and

00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,980
female and it doesn't necessarily mean

00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,740
that they're equal jobs and that they're

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:33,110
paid the same so there can still be a

00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:36,110
gender gap even if you have a perfect

00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,900
50/50 split between male and female but

00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:41,240
women are still paid 75 cents on the

00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,460
dollar compared to men and in lots of

00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,100
cases yeah I would just I would just

00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,930
close with with another quote that we

00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,340
like to use and that's nobody has the

00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,100
right to sit down and feel hopeless

00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,660
because there's too much work to do not

00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,140
only technical problems but human

00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:59,300
problems as well and so we we all had a

00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,120
lot to do so so the young people among

00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,950
us don't have to suffer you know just

00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,470
just bad treatment you know everybody

00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,390
we're all peers were all smart and we

00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,550
need every single brain that we can

00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:13,280
muster to build the future that we want

00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:15,240
to see for each other so again thank you

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,190
all please

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,150
all these people over the next few days

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:26,749
and give them a round of applause

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:26,749
