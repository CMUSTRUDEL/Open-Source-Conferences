to push a community and I learn a lot

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,810
from my mentors during this contact and

00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:24,210
I work on Android project mainly in open

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,859
event Android and SUSE Android and I

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,079
have some contribution to paramedic bed

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,890

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:35,460
you yeah so I'm a cash I go by the name

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,370
of humble D if that's familiar so I've

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,800
been contributing to the Suzy project

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,690
the Shasta project and a little bit on

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,060
the PS lab project the web apps mostly

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,360
so what I actually wanted to contribute

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,560
to was the core part of Suzy AI and

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,170
yesterday I got a chance to talk with

00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,600
orbit about that so I'm kind of inspired

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,690
by the Iron Man movie but we have a long

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,780
way to go so thank you all the mentors

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,440
Mario orbital and I'm sorry I use that

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,190
name quite often

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,140
thank you exactly so I think like an

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,240
important message also from us is that

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,060
it's not always like in one direction

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,450
yeah of course like the mentors always

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,670
have but actually what I see is that new

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,610
participants coati participants and so

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,260
on they help each other and and this is

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,360
always what I answer when people ask me

00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,860
Oh Mario Mario can you review in a

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,470
project sometimes where I've never

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,420
contributed code yeah we have never

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,310
contribute anything so we have a lot of

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,200
different projects but the message that

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,420
we really want to send out is the

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,270
community can work together even newbies

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,070
can review poor requests and can say

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,570
okay here's an issue or here's something

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,909
that needs to be solved and help each

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,670
other so this is also a message in the

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,549
coated program and we really value

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,250
