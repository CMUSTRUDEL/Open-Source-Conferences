good afternoon can you all hear me you

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,480
will have forgotten my name by the time

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,689
you have your dinner tonight what you

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:38,190
will not forget this in the next two or

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:48,770
three days this introduction why the

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:53,730
cause I am different and I stand out

00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,800
that's why you will not forget it so how

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,840
did and that's the first item in my

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,899
professional toolkit doesn't matter

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,480
whether you're engineer lawyers

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:07,530
scientists of whatever you have to stand

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:13,950
out what did I do

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:16,650
how did I discover this I got myself a

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,369
first class honours from Manchester

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,960
University and it was sheer hard work

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:31,020
and what did I do to get that first

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:34,530
class honours we did a very simple

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,630
experiment just boy exactly like that

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,729
you can see from the dead this is half a

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,220
century ago boiled the water measured

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,500
the temperature put some salt in it

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,549
boiled it again and measure the

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,950
temperature again even p6 students in

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,930
Singapore know that the temperature of

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,759
the second is higher than the

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:02,280
temperature of pure water so fine that's

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,670
great but then I have to explain why

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,119
does it behave like that well that was

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,030
easy

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,300
went to the library hundreds of books

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,850
tell you why does the temperature change

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,810
and it's

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:22,090
something to do with energy of solution

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:24,060
great then I said to myself can I

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,560
predict the temperature of the water

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:31,930
based on the properties of the salt

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,580
nothing I don't know I've not looked

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,000
recently whether there's anything in

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,340
there in the literature nothing so I did

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,060
that little bit extra that's a little

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,980
bit action and put that in my report

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,650
consequence I got noticed

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,790
I got noticed by my tutor by my lecturer

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,490
by my professor by the Dean just that

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,720
little bit and I got my first class

00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:00,040
honours and my career was off at a

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,320
trajectory like that

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:17,350
who sent both his is no faster than my

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:18,730
career right so two things I learned at

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,750
Manchester University

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:25,860
I learnt engineering they say but more

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,360
importantly I learned how to learn

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,250
because you don't know what you learn

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,190
today and you don't know what you might

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,990
might want to use tomorrow so I learned

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,410
how to learn and then being a member of

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,840
the institution of Mechanical Engineers

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:48,520
they put some pressure on me to put some

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,700
discipline on continue to learn I have

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,350
to continue to learn doesn't matter

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,450
whether you're engineer as I said

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,610
earlier or a dentist or a doctor you've

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:02,250
got to continue to learn and now even

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,250
faster because things are moving so fast

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,340
right so what did I do with my education

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:12,610
I went to work for a company American

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,550
company based in the UK making materials

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,220
handling equipment and they were making

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,930
this innocent-looking pallet truck is

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:25,730
called a pallet rock has got two fingers

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:28,910
and that was a design imported from USA

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,700
and you would work in Europe because the

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:38,900
this finger was so wide they won't enter

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:42,470
the European palate here the US Peck was

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,290
ten inch one ton capacity Europe wanted

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:49,430
seven inch one ten capacity u.s. offered

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:56,660
seven inch three-quarter ton and I

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:58,490
designed it seven inch one ton both of

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,920
you are engineer might understand this

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,130
but I'll explain it in Leominster what I

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,900
did was very simple not rocket science

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,360
it's very simple theory of structures I

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,800
just redistributed the material so that

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,670
the top layer and the bottom layer

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,870
equally shared the work done to support

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,240
the Lord that's all this was very

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,160
imbalance the bottom layer was like

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,920
working like crazy three four times

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:33,260
harder than the top layer and you

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:39,140
costing a wrong result went into

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:43,310
production sales on that truck for my

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:47,150
company rocketed but before we got to

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,920
that step I took through it but to prove

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,740
it

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:55,460
Here I am merely a fresh graduate from

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,710
university telling designers in USA of

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,950
materials and leg equipment how they can

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:05,390
design a pallet truck to meet the

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:07,220
specification I had to prove it I'll

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,650
show you the next slide but you don't

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,470
have to really said there's an

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:17,240
engineering slide but I'll illustrate it

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:21,650
by using this hanger what the slide says

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:25,310
is that if you deform an item which they

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,790
call the elastic range elastic range it

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,070
will come back to its original shape but

00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:37,600
if you deform it beyond their lattice

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,600
right it's useless right for the bed

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:43,409
imagine your car goes over a pothole you

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:50,159
don't want it to come out of bent and

00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:54,690
twisted do you so it is the science

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:56,940
behind that are used to make analog

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,610
simulations there are digital

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,310
simulations these days I used analog

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:06,569
simulation because this was the only

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:11,729
tool available to me I'll show you two

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:15,240
more things before I demonstrate what I

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:20,940
actually did this will just this is not

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:24,509
invented this is real stuff I have a

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,379
piece of metal here I bend it can

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:31,289
anybody see it

00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:34,229
bending now because you need strain

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:36,030
gauges data loggers transducer a God

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:42,090
knows what else to find out whether this

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:44,870
is bending I have a piece of foam you

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:51,029
can probably just about see it bending a

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:53,630
polystyrene foam now I have this sir

00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:57,060
right at the back and you see it bending

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,460
can you see it come back straight this

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,449
is the material behaving like any other

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,279
engineering material but it's got a

00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:07,219
mechanical amplifier built into it I

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:13,110
don't need data loggers I don't need

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:16,469
transducers and strain gauges so I make

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,580
my models using these materials and I'll

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:23,240
demonstrate to you here and now what the

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,240
effect was

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,470
those of your engineers will understand

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,449
what's a simply supported beam is this

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,279
I'm going to make a simply supported

00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:52,899
beam I put this beam in there simply

00:08:51,279 --> 00:09:03,040
supported means it's only supported on

00:08:52,899 --> 00:09:07,120
two sides I put this beam in I put a

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,420
weight on it this tip in fact you can

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:16,990
see this on the next slide as well this

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:20,860
deflects more than this and this is this

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,449
represent the shape of the finger this

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,880
is the shape I showed you at the top

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:30,449
which is very inefficient this is a

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:38,079
shape which is very efficient right then

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:41,100
to make it more dramatic I made it out

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,100
of my amplifier built in amplifier

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
material

00:09:49,520 --> 00:10:00,180
put a weight on it put a weight on that

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:04,920
which one deflects more right argument

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:07,770
was finished no more argument

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,960
how can he prove it is he qualified

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:15,020
enough and old enough to be able to make

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:24,780
these recommendations and I got some

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:27,320
additions to my toolkit I grabbed the

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,670
opportunity to redesign something

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,040
opportunities are there in all

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,830
directions if you look and if you're

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:42,210
hungry enough they are there

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:46,620
I am the respect of the marketing and

00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:48,990
you say how do you know because I got

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,880
onto the Christmas mailing list of the

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,710
marketing and the sales department and

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,620
they don't give you anything for free

00:10:52,710 --> 00:11:01,470
that's never not the employees customers

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:04,550
yes I won the trust of the people in the

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:08,190
company how do I know I won the trust

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:11,580
because now they would come to me seek

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:15,960
my opinion seek my advice and listen to

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:22,230
me great stuff I'm happy they're happy

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:27,030
and I got noticed and you say how do I

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:29,010
know I got noticed the vice president of

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:33,510
the American company offered me to go

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:38,400
and manage his design office now that's

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:41,430
some notice so I increased my toolkit to

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,080
add those as I keep saying doesn't have

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:48,060
to be engineering I use my engineering

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:51,030
knowledge to sell the idea but these are

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,640
required by any professional no matter

00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,640
which field or any employee

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:05,980
right in my infinite wisdom I did not

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,800
take the job to go to America I took a

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:14,410
job to go to redlund which make 1

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,740
billion times a year 18,000 employees 4

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:22,810
billion turnover big company when I

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:30,430
joined I was a tadpole in a big red land

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:37,270
ocean when I during my tenure I became a

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:39,160
well in the redolent technical pond now

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,170
this is the question about you go work

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,180
for a big company or a small company

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,340
that doesn't matter is where you are

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:54,550
working which part of the work company

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:56,970
you are working is important I and what

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,970
happened next

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,570
before I tell you what happens next I

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:10,980
have to give you a very 30-second or one

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:14,800
minute lesson on tile making dolls are

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:18,190
otherwise the context doesn't work many

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,100
different shapes but this is the

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:23,320
important bit here a tile is sitting on

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,150
a roof looks very innocent a shape

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,290
nothing but when you look under

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:32,110
underneath it is as complex as any

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:36,070
article you can name to me any article

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:39,250
is got very complex shapes it's got very

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:44,160
complex mold to build or make the shape

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,160
on very complex tools to build a shape

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:52,500
match any industry aerospace automotive

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:57,730
shipping you name it it'll match it and

00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:00,640
this is the punchline these concrete

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,250
tiles are sitting on your roof if you

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,780
got Singapore have them as well the

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:10,440
sitting on your roof with no sealant is

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:14,730
Thailand Thailand

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:18,070
- guaranteed to last 75 years in

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:21,460
durability and guaranteed that there

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:26,800
will be no water penetration for 75

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:29,200
years when once in 75 year event means

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,120
there's only one storm comes every 75

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,310
year is so severe it destroys things

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,870
what a one penny trade they're that

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:45,220
accurate not only that tile made in year

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:49,060
one has to fit where the tile made in

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:53,730
year 20 maybe here ten because people

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:56,800
have the habit of renovating extending

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,590
they do break people do silly things on

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,220
them you got to repair them so this tile

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,680
which was installed 15 years ago you go

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,180
to our factory by a talk and it will fit

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,800
and they'll just still keep the water

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,420
out not many industries can claim that

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
and I'll talk about that a bit later as

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,440
well so that's about the towel so you

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,710
it's important that this it may not

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,710
sound very sexy I tell you it's got

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:29,940
challenges now that a bit about the tall

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:33,220
plant a tall plant is a fairly long

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,200
building if you are a descendant

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,700
something is going on on this end you

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,100
don't know what's going on unless

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,370
somebody tells you no cameras in those

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,370
days

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:51,350
I arrived at my new work suited booted

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:55,730
my boss gave me the car of my new the

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:58,160
keys of my new car and he said Kogi I'm

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:02,840
sorry but I haven't got a job for you

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh so I said well you go and visit some

00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,360
tall plants two three days and I love

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,230
fixed it got a long story short I ended

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:18,500
up in a tile factory for three months

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:21,490
three months and that had impact on my

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,490
toolkit

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,300
the first thing thing was I grabbed the

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:35,660
opportunity to go and work I didn't

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:40,399
complain hey I'm a manager I can't work

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:43,370
in a tile factory now so I grabbed the

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,680
opportunity when I first arrived the

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,500
workers were very very suspicious of me

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,720
because they said Oh another boy from

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:55,430
the center come to tell us what we

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,399
should do but in time I started to just

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,839
like them have the same safety clothes

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,600
helmet tote actors

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,179
I worked there shift I ate in their

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,410
canteen worked their time and they

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,530
started to trust me

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,589
now they would tell me if there's a

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:15,170
stoppage at the other end of the factory

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:18,380
and I'm the other why it has stopped

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:20,750
not only that they shared with me with

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,030
information on how to run the power

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:29,720
plant 24/7 which is not in the manuals

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:33,590
this in their heads and that is

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:41,210
difficult to get out so I won that trust

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:46,340
and I got help from them I earned the

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,440
respect of my colleagues when I finally

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,070
went to manage the design office which

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,670
had come my colleagues knew that

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:58,820
probably I knew more about tail making

00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:01,910
than they did because they even in 20

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,460
years wouldn't have spent a collection

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,990
of thirty three months work of time in

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,820
attire works so won the respect

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:17,179
instantly no problem

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:19,970
I got noticed I travel watching me the

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,990
talent manager was watching me the board

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,309
was watching me

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,010
yeah they have given me a brand new

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:28,820
flashy car and writing my paycheck and

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,370
I'm doing nothing for three months so

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,410
somebody was paying attention watching

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,410
me so I got noticed

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:46,970
and most of all my knowledge increased

00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:50,600
by a step change completely new field of

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,080
knowledge I had it nobody could take it

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,080
away from me

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:08,340
so what did I do next okay I then

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,430
started I migrated from designing

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,460
machinery and plant to designing the

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:17,160
concrete product itself now that's a

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,250
completely new feat for me so this is

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:24,000
where new learning comes in when I

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:31,290
started tiles were weighing 5.3

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,160
kilograms each and by the time I left we

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:38,690
could make the same performance style at

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,370
4.3 kilograms and it was done with

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:45,240
introducing new technologies and new

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:47,700
tools see ad computer computer design

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,810
computer-aided manufacturing finite

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:55,980
element analysis genetic algorithms new

00:19:51,810 --> 00:20:00,770
terms very very new terms quarter of a

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:06,600
century ago there are everyday tools now

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:13,920
ok had to justify all that lot was very

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:15,990
very very expensive so this slide is

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:20,150
full of equations I'm not going to teach

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:24,600
you equations I only make a few points

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:28,530
if you have a big problem how does one

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:33,200
solve a big problem cut it up thank you

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:35,640
very much sir you cut it up into smaller

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,420
sections and solve that

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,410
that's what finite element element

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:46,320
analysis it breaks it up into small part

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:49,560
analyzes it and then measures the effect

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,720
of that on to the next part when I've

00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,990
designed the first style I didn't have a

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:59,940
computer I didn't even have a calculator

00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:03,560
I had to use my slide rule I don't know

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,560
whether you've ever seen a slide rule

00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:14,089
and this was my Google so I did cut it

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,949
up into small segments but I couldn't

00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:18,529
cut it up too small because I'd be

00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:24,679
wearing my slide rule out to calculate

00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:26,419
it CAD argument one make a CAD model you

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:33,889
can slice it up as many times as you

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:37,819
want f e a we have an expert in amongst

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:43,239
us on f EA at the back here Clive will

00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:46,849
introduce me I'll tell you a story I

00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:49,669
attended a symposium organized by Clive

00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:53,149
knife em symposium it had speakers

00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:55,429
talking about a fear simulation designed

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,879
tools and all that or from all over the

00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:59,329
world and there was a gentleman very

00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:03,229
clever

00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:06,319
gentleman who introduced a novel way of

00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:09,559
designing a beam and he was using nature

00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:13,059
the lattice system the nature uses to

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,969
design a being very light very strong I

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,209
talked to him during the coffee break

00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:22,519
and I said to him assume I have a

00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:26,689
perfect material that the material has

00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:31,779
no defects and I want to design a

00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:38,719
component to the factor of safety of one

00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:40,399
what are my risks I still strive to work

00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:42,499
to work talents I haven't got an answer

00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,479
but I'm still working at it and I'm

00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:47,719
going to challenge you guys to think

00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:50,479
about it he didn't have an answer

00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:54,229
obviously then I said how do you

00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:58,459
validate it I say we do strain energy

00:22:54,229 --> 00:23:00,849
calculations and ah now that's where the

00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:03,859
problem lies

00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:10,999
this is a fundamental equation for the

00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:14,089
theory of structures 99.9% times people

00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:17,269
use it to find applications and it goes

00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:18,410
in that direction FA you make parts you

00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,620
go to Google you

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,940
to a to a lecture theatre they'll say

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,970
that's the formula if you want to

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:32,420
calculate the stress strain and all that

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:35,210
right and you use that however I thought

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,160
in this direction how did the formula

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,040
come out in the first place it's a

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,090
mathematical formula pure mathematicians

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,900
solve it in ten seconds flat no problem

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:51,350
but to apply two engineering solutions

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:54,950
there are ten assumptions built up in to

00:23:51,350 --> 00:24:00,500
arriving at that and if you want to

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:04,070
design to a factor of safety of one you

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:06,500
want to address those assumptions if you

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:10,490
cannot address those assumptions you

00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:15,050
cannot design it we had a fairly

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:18,080
friendly chat after that genetic

00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,870
algorithms again I was on the same

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,750
platform giving a talk at and to you and

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,430
know at one of the universities I forgot

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,560
and there was a professor foreign to you

00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,500
we were both waiting for our turns to

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,560
come and we started talking and he

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,030
mentioned genetic algorithms GA okay

00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,400
yeah what about it so we are trying to

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,130
promote this I told me I introduced that

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:45,220
as a tool in my company 25 years ago in

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:48,320
a different office yeah point here is

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,750
there are opportunities is there hungry

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,260
enough you will find them I found

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,550
genetic algorithms by accident and I

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,620
won't go through that because we have

00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,840
got very short time in this presentation

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,500
but I can talk to any one of you if you

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,310
wish to talk to me after the event quite

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,310
happy to talk to you

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,029
right next

00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:15,529
ah this is a Xena I've got lots of

00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:15,529
storage done this is a nice one

00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:24,929
rudlin built a brand new tile factory on

00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:28,379
a greenfield site costing 12 million

00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:34,529
sterling we're talking of those days 50

00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:38,129
million Singapore brand-new factory they

00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:42,210
could make what we call the main tile

00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:45,210
because main tile on a roof bulk of the

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,710
roof is covered with the main time but

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,289
to finish the roof you have to have

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:52,499
fittings they complete the edges of the

00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:57,019
roof without that roof doesn't work it

00:25:52,499 --> 00:26:01,080
leaks they could make the tiles

00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:06,059
mentha has no problem 15 times the mold

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,729
just cracked in the tile machine yard is

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:13,409
filling up making half a million tons a

00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:16,320
week at 140 pieces per minute three

00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:18,899
shift and nothing is going out because

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,779
we haven't got the fittings panic panic

00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,989
panic brainstorm session let's talk to

00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:26,279
university let's talk to consultants

00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:29,809
anybody anybody who knows anything about

00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,999
tile making or tile design talk to them

00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:36,059
everything looked six to eight months

00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:40,369
away with a ton of scrap at the end of

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:48,119
it all the scrapped molds and whatever I

00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:51,479
used my friend this material here these

00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:55,830
are actual photos of what I showed to my

00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:58,679
CEO that's how they were in a bit of

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:01,529
cardboard and a foam model and I

00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:05,700
demonstrated by the phone model that the

00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:09,029
failure was occurring here you can see

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:13,950
this pending and that's how exactly the

00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:16,679
real molds were failing and I said we

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:20,969
can reinforce it to stop that failure

00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,349
and I've got those models here outside

00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,750
of the meeting if you want to look

00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:27,059
weekend

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:29,880
within a month all the moles in the

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,210
factory were modified factory was

00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,210
running

00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:43,750
you have to have respect you will have

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,870
to have earned respect you will have to

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:54,930
have won the trust to be able to do that

00:27:46,870 --> 00:28:00,540
type of thing then I taught myself

00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:05,890
automation self-taught myself automation

00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:07,930
removed all the clouds of release agent

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,920
from the talmy made it a proper machine

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:14,140
to remove the dust clouds from the

00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:18,420
cement mixer in fact even removed a man

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:23,230
from it but all the proper dust control

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:26,740
saved money each tile plant could make a

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,530
very various shapes stringing from

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,630
anywhere one of these and when they

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,350
changed the profile from one shape to

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:38,830
the other

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:41,890
it used take 30 minutes or more reduce

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,990
that time to four minute and there was a

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,740
record they built they printed these

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:50,380
shut in honor of the work we did one

00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,570
minute and 38 second was the fastest

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,510
anybody ever changed a profile in at our

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:58,150
work all that was achieved with

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:02,610
automation at that time solitaire

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:06,280
switches were coming PLC's DC drives

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:08,470
controls using those all the bang-bang

00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,630
systems were removed and controlled

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,360
acceleration controlled deceleration

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:17,440
controlled the product exactly where you

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,140
wanted to stop or start from so plant

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,390
speeds increased from ninety two hundred

00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:26,290
and forty pieces per minute huge impact

00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:28,450
on profit in were to drive PLC control

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,300
solid-state switching increased my

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:35,320
knowledge certainly improved the

00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,330
efficiency of the plant breakage you

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,890
know remained you're running with your

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,880
sand castle on your hand you'd stop

00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,830
certainly breakage reduce by 2 percent 1

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,450
billion times they are making

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:53,720
remember 2% maybe not a very big number

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:58,250
profile gem times change from 32 to 4

00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:02,900
minutes and the one which I really savor

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:06,230
out of that is we made it change to the

00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:11,210
quality of the life of the workers and

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:14,060
their families I didn't like to work in

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:19,010
there why should I expect anybody else

00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:23,480
to be working in that market so that is

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:27,110
what engineers can do change the quality

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,600
of life save the environment save the

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:33,130
planet by reducing glass resource and

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,130
all that what about the people

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:52,190
okay I haven't got the slide next okay I

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,660
was going to show you a sand pit where

00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:59,090
the I'll skip that the slide has got

00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:02,230
miss gone missing now this is a an

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:09,140
example of communications and

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:12,530
empowerment and sharing I was working on

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,270
a project which was my patent I don't

00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:19,960
know I've got about 20 patents I forget

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:23,299
lose count of them and I needed after

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:27,820
million pound sterling to do the

00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:31,429
development in one trance and normal

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:37,370
submission for such request was 50,000

00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:40,040
60,000 I wondered half a million the

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,500
idea was not normal the idea was to put

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,299
very good material at the top which is

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,059
the aesthetics part of it which you guys

00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:49,220
see every day and put functional

00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:51,940
material at the bottom but the extrusion

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,610
process or the making process was so

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:59,110
violent that he mix it all up and the

00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:02,179
invention was to find a solution to that

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:05,030
it so happened that the main board

00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:07,910
visited the technical division one

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:13,340
afternoon lots of presentations were set

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:15,140
up and mine was one of them I chose to

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:19,730
make my presentation at the trial

00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:23,740
machine we were working on and my MD

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,740
said Kogi I give you one piece of advice

00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:31,910
get your points out in the first 45

00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:34,730
seconds if you don't you'll lose them

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,710
these captains of industry are smart

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,419
people

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:41,510
if you throw a lot of jargon at them

00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:44,900
they'll see through that fog you cannot

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:47,600
fool them 45 seconds so I wrote this one

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:51,200
slide and wrote it at the time we make 1

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:55,430
million tons 1 billion tiles 4.5 billion

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,370
concrete and each ton of tile this is

00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:02,200
the cost of this material this is the

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:05,720
composition we put four pounds of sand

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,970
16 pounds of cement and 12 pounds of

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,180
pigment in it and I said I'm going to

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,040
save four to 40 percent of the 12

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:18,470
because I'm not going to put pigment

00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:21,830
here immediately the question came Kogi

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:27,380
how are we gonna do it great they were

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:29,570
hooked know that I could take all my

00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,310
time to tell everything now this is

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,030
where the sharing and the empowerment

00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,390
come

00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:39,650
I had my technicians and my design

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:42,920
colleagues at the site I wanted to give

00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:48,710
them the opportunity there two minutes

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:51,980
of glory with the board most of my

00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:58,820
patterns although armed in winter we

00:33:51,980 --> 00:34:00,980
have Co patentees on it just imagine a

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,110
technician working in a shop the

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,000
technician can have very good ideas no

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,780
problem whether they will be able to

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,750
have a patented very very difficult

00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:14,090
because to patent something you have to

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,810
have a very very narrow fine the world

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,340
is full of very many clever people and

00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,470
to patent something is extremely

00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:26,030
difficult and now these people get their

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:29,150
name on a patent there's no better thank

00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:33,260
you than that these guys would do

00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:36,260
anything for me honestly they would do

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,800
anything in terms of work I have no

00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,800
problem with

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:53,440
that's the last slide of my presentation

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:57,599
so that's my toolkit get noticed take

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,599
opportunities opportunities are there

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:09,220
educate yourself increase your knowledge

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:12,609
and respect when trust an ethics very

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:17,530
important one last turn I was developing

00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:22,000
a product in the USA and the USA has a

00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:25,420
very very stringent fire test what they

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,869
do is they take a tile put a ton of coal

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,540
or they call it brand but it's pieces of

00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,460
wood dried up pieces of wood light fire

00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:37,500
to the wood and the tile should

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:41,500
withstand that for 45 minutes

00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:45,069
very tough test and our towels were not

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:48,819
doing that and one time luckily we had a

00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:53,680
marginal pass the certifier said I can

00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:57,849
pass it and I said no I wouldn't have

00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:01,030
those tiles on my house there was

00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:02,589
tremendous pressure from that the beers

00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,150
saying look we have passed the test

00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:08,650
let's get on and start making them I

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,260
think I wouldn't have that on my time

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:17,520
house why should I let others have it on

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:20,520
their home and of my presentation any

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,520
questions

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:40,980
no because I don't release the product

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,830
because it's marginal just imagine we

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,560
put it on the roof and the roof

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,210
they have forest fires in California's

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,130
because I'm pull something falls on it

00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,130
burns it and the house burns down

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,819
well mentality well it depends

00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:13,190
no it depends on the individual I'm

00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:13,990
saying I I had high ethics ethical

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,730
standards

00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:19,160
my institution says I should have very

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,010
high at ethical standards if you join

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,380
IES Institute of Engineers in Zakopane

00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,150
they say you should have a high ethical

00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,240
standard and you won't be certified as a

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,250
chartered engineer if you don't but

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:37,900
there would be people who would take a

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:43,160
chance I won't that's the difference

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:46,520
okay if you're not completely bored by

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,609
now I I'll show you this last slide and

00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:54,380
I'll you've seen these on the streets of

00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:57,829
Singapore right when the first came out

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,369
I looked at the first byte sitting at Mr

00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:02,450
hazard

00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:04,790
good grief would I write it because this

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:08,450
is one bike which is going to hit the

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:11,390
curbs on and off the curbs more than any

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:15,980
other bike not we're not talking about

00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:23,049
BMX riders who will do crazy things and

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:29,569
this tube was so small who worried me so

00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:32,359
I went home and the way I am first I bei

00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:33,890
don't that base reference model and

00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:41,960
looked at where is the weakest point of

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:44,030
the bike and did that I don't need I got

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,040
tons of them more of them if you want to

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:49,390
talk to them but you have been a

00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:54,780
tremendous audience thank you very much

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,780
[Applause]

00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:04,850
okay

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Oh nobody wants to go right you want

00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:12,980
more oh well okay if you have time I

00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,150
don't think I'm pushed to be because I

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,420
didn't know whether I'll be allowed to

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:27,350
stay in the room or not I can I can

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:31,780
carry on yeah because I might have been

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:31,780
I don't think anybody is following us

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:45,280
okay look this is your bike

00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:02,720
usually I give this talk in 45 minutes

00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:08,089
they allowed me only 25 I've taken 30 so

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:15,829
I think this this was the first bike I

00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:17,930
saw okay I think it's a bit unfair

00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:20,300
because these guys will design these are

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,790
not slouches so they must have done some

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:26,960
homework to make sure that they would

00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:32,900
work but it certainly rangamma alarm

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:35,930
bells in my mind right I have to repair

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,630
it so many times it keeps breaking and

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,220
it's now not more stiffer than it

00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,559
originally is because I had to put

00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:53,630
stiffness in here as you can see how to

00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:57,579
patch it up is hollow yeah no they they

00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:00,319
are lighter for the same strength but

00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:03,220
the beauty of these types of models is

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,170
as long as you do it the same to each

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,410
family it doesn't matter it gives you

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,780
the answer it gives you the trend right

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,660
if I if I use the hollow there and solid

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,690
air that will be unfair but I'm using

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:22,369
solid and it tells me this is stronger

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:24,920
than that structure wise where the

00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:26,859
deflections are you try to calculate the

00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,440
deflection of that using one of the

00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:32,569
solid modelers which you got they'll

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,369
take your a fair time to actually make

00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:36,710
the model first and then you have to

00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,720
apply the boundary conditions where are

00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:46,130
the forces coming from where are they

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:47,930
going no this is stronger and this this

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:51,950
then I started to play with what would I

00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:54,710
do if I was to just advance it from

00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,839
there yeah there were there are some

00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,700
bikes with the i-beam on the on the

00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:00,970
street as well not many but there are

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,970
some

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:16,880
one of these members yes that's I've

00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:17,210
seen those yeah oh yeah I can't believe

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,230
it

00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:26,839
cantilever wheel cantilever no oh it's a

00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:30,769
got a gear inside so the point here is

00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:34,240
that I'm not saying you shouldn't use

00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:38,750
both models and simulation is very right

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:45,920
but I'm saying I don't have that or I

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:49,250
can find the answers oh it's a it's so

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,010
simple in terms of engineering just

00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:56,180
shift you are engineers or studying to

00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:58,190
be engineers yeah okay well this is a

00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,440
matter of neutral axis if you understand

00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,930
you two Lexus in the old one the neutral

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,510
axis where high and I just brought the

00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,510
neutral axis to the middle that's all

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,960
right well I've enjoyed talking to you

00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:13,960
