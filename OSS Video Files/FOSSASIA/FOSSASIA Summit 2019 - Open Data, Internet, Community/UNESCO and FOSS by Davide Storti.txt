I'm Davide I'm from UNESCO and I've been

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:11,130
you know lucky enough to participate in

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,870
the first Asia for several several years

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:19,680
even back in 2011 I think first time and

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,769
so I'm going to basically continue a

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,900
little bit to this day story that I was

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:28,680
presenting the last time last when year

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,279
ago when I was here and it's also about

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,040
the programs that we run on feel pencil

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,350
softer and particularly the use mobile

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,480
initiatives so UNESCO as has been

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,460
promoting phosphors several years now

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,910
and you know original UNESCO was

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,420
developing software but then we went

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,090
through some kind of you know stage is

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,969
very complicated with the beginning of

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,300
the year 2000 a lot of pressure from the

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:05,100
industry and and then we went back again

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,500
today today and say the promotion of the

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,150
idea beyond be enforced so you just

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,790
place the guided as a United Nations

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,720
agency is guided by the sustainable

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,400
development goals I've tried to go very

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,280
fast because and which is which are

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,049
basically covering basically the entire

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:32,100
thing that we should supposed to do to

00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:33,380
basically save planet and humanity all

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,439
together

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:42,390
so how you nest with supporting Foss

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,939
we've been working with the communities

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,820
first of all so communities mainly in

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,479
Africa in Asia as well with with the

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,259
Festiva community and we are very proud

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,540
to be here and we also been working

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,939
together in several other projects

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,140
beyond that you sum it that no but so

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,790
first of all first for us this

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,950
collaboration is the collaboration among

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,690
people so this is what is the most

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,810
important so we try to promote the value

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,570
behind the default so it's cooperation

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,120
it is

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:21,040
the philosophy the first field being

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,490
able to use we use adapt for example to

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,620
local knowledge local needs and of

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:31,690
course the ability to be inclusive

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,850
because being participative approach no

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,250
no one can be left behind so it is a

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:41,860
there's a huge accent want inclusivity

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,810
particularly on the gender gap as Mary

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,830
was mentioning this morning that we're

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,480
trying to do our best but it's not easy

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:55,450
and unfortunately for various reasons

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,380
the gap is not diminishing actually it's

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,770
increasing in many many many places so

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,810
we try to apply the first principles to

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:09,070
different things not only to software

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:11,440
but also to other objects like the open

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,900
educational resources which is which are

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,410
basically maybe a textbook that you may

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:22,660
use in your classroom that are also open

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:25,300
and that you can reuse and adapt to your

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,940
local context UNESCO was the first UN

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,019
agency to be approving a open access

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,890
policy so that means cos publications

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:39,489
are released the open access by default

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:44,800
and we also been on the gender part

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:47,800
we've been also fostering the de stem

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,080
which was mentioned the previous speaker

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,370
or steam has also said Arts in it and

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,980
there is there are some reports that you

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,880
may find UNESCO website like the one

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,870
which is it's called cracking the code

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:09,250
which is analyzing the the gap in skills

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,430
for girls in society and for this work

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,380
also we participate in the equals global

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,570
partnership in this particularly

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,780
coalition in this case coalition of the

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,710
equals four trying to find a measure a

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:29,940
way to measure the this

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:35,190
the skill gap but then of course one as

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,410
was mentioned before one of the main

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,699
idea mainly HDTV that we are running is

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,819
they use mobile initiative which is

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:45,919
basically trying to teach or approach

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:49,259
more young people to the basically

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,800
building by doing software so that the

00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:58,380
technology is not a black box or a TV

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,490
that you want to turn off as but rather

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,320
it's something that you want to

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,990
understand how it works since they're by

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,050
understanding how it works that you may

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:15,570
actually really develop your own things

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:19,889
so your belief is running in many many

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:22,409
countries and we reached thousands of

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,539
beneficiaries in different ways but also

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:27,360
we participate in some larger activities

00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,580
which here which are addressing much

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,060
more number of people like the Africa

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,539
called week which is a one year process

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,389
which end up in one or two weeks of

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:42,330
coding workshops for kids and last year

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,300
which is like 2.3 million people in 37

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,219
countries across Africa it says s AP

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,690
initiative that UNICEF is backing up for

00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:53,130
the last three four years and with the

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:59,130
participation of many other partners

00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:00,120
including but software source code is it

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,199
- two minutes left

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,110
really substances cause it was about

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,090
creativity after all so this is the the

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,219
basic line also the use mobile why you

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,210
should learn how to code because it's a

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:17,250
form of expression but and we are in

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,199
point of history whether they've never

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,659
been so many programmers as of today

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,050
despite of the older graphs and there

00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:27,090
are so many languages International Year

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,780
it's a sort of indigenous languages

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,250
innocence

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:35,350
so why if it is about creativity why

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,690
then we don't really care about the

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,190
preservation of a source code so Scott

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,680
is something that you put somewhere

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,960
maybe in get to get up in some

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,150
repository in some working to but

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,400
basically you don't really care about

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:53,110
what what is going to happen to it

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,890
you remember Google also had the

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,830
repository which was closed in a matter

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:04,660
of weeks a couple of years ago and and

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:07,930
so what 1.5 million software projects

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,500
will just delete it if it didn't become

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,390
fit before so preserving source code is

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,210
about the preservation yes but it's not

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,820
about the recognition of the effort

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:24,630
which under went into the making of the

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:27,010
code it about reducibility of the of the

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,520
the use that you make of the code to

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,680
think about scientific experiences the

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,990
persistency because you may want to

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,170
refer to a piece of code which is not

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,500
moving all over the web or disappearing

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:44,770
one day and also so how to make a

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,720
reference to this code and maybe one day

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,090
how to make a citation of the code so

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,720
last year I was presenting this as an

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,720
idea

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:57,580
it's a assumption as we developed with

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,560
we collaborate with India but it's about

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,930
it's called software it is not org it's

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,210
now open because last year in June and

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,760
the earth near tide was open so this is

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,250
really an archive an archive of software

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:14,500
source code not an archive of binaries

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:16,740
but a core source code only and with

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,740
maybe

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:27,430
I risk my life I know but I think it's

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:45,280
very important you - well this is this

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:48,010
is how can I so this is the the one of

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,490
the page of the software additives of

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,410
torque and actually this is what it

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,080
contains basically the content of the

00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:01,200
archive comes from all these

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,200
repositories and as of today in live

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:10,720
update it contains 88 million software

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:14,500
projects for an amount of 5 billion

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,420
something source files etc and all the

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,390
commits so it's not only the latest

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,820
version of the code that it's there it's

00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,470
really entire history of the commits of

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,260
the of the project so that you want if

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,950
you want to come back to how was the

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:33,339
software before you may have a timeline

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:38,800
and what is now possible to do is of

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:42,360
course to search with some time so

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,510
search which is being of course to make

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:55,860
improved little by little but you can

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:55,860
actually do a search and let's make this

00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,670
research

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:13,100
so these remember which one is one but

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:16,040
anyway you may find here if the software

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,980
was properly put in you can find here

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,410
their readme and all the information

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:26,089
exercise you can actually go to the to

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:40,759
the code in this case it's not it's not

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:42,860
an open code for example this is the

00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,009
software of the Apollo 11 which was put

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,449
back in the archive so but if you

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:49,430
probably if you use get up

00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,139
you can search yourself or yourself you

00:10:49,430 --> 00:11:07,399
find your own code in there in the

00:10:51,139 --> 00:11:10,420
archives so this is look but that's

00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,420
really the the

00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:23,850
demo of course no it's not them it's

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:35,459
live actually so we have two main things

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:37,500
open I am actually but I am actually but

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,720
anyway so what you can do

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:45,000
let's let's the cut it short what you

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:49,579
can do you can actually copy a part of

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,480
the code there and using a permalink

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:57,779
here this red thing there is you can

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,029
actually get a permanent reference to

00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:07,199
that piece of code so that you can if

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:12,319
you copy this key here you can just open

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,319
a in other this is me sorry

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:21,569
and I retrieve exactly this piece of

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,550
code in the archive so for the first

00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:27,269
time ever actually you have the

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:30,389
possibility to make a reference to a

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:34,769
persistent piece of code into an archive

00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,449
which is not going to be moved if we

00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:40,470
heard about not even know about github

00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:42,449
being both by Microsoft with very good

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,379
intentions for sure but maybe tomorrow

00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:48,449
maybe tomorrow the that the idea will

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:52,250
change and here you have been a given

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:56,279
archive so that's a one important part

00:12:52,250 --> 00:13:03,050
just to conclude what is also important

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:03,050
to know is these manage

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:16,829
very fast you see so building on the top

00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:18,959
of the archival UNESCO stroll is to

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,610
bring this to the attention of the of

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,170
the decision makers of the people that

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,769
should be caring about these things so

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:28,379
we issued just a couple of weeks ago the

00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:30,620
Paris call for software source code as a

00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,990
heritage for sustainable development and

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,029
basically it's making it's made by a

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,399
group of expert international experts

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:43,620
that define this this this call and it's

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,560
making also some principles for source

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,170
code and it's also identifying some

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,000
traits to source code among which the

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,699
awareness the challenge is lack of

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,339
recognition because after all computer

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,990
science is not recognized as a noble

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,569
science in many parts of the world so

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,720
the risk is just to become the less a

00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:05,910
the workers of the 21st century nobody

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,430
cares because machines will probably do

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,660
something like that which is not true

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:14,339
we've been hearing about the machine

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:19,559
software for a long time still it's not

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:23,790
there so we did the last point with

00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:26,550
artificial intelligence this is also may

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,220
be worsening in a sense and it's it's

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,980
really highlighting the need of doing

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,559
something about this recognition what

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,509
source code because there are many

00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:40,500
issues that ethical issues that are

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:43,319
raised by intelligence and this is one

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:48,930
part one stool that could be give some

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:52,079
answers and we saw in the press already

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,509
some articles that are actually

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,329
injecting some fears because artificial

00:14:54,509 --> 00:15:00,930
intelligence as an open tool is seen by

00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:04,050
those who don't be understand the

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:07,680
openness as something which is wrong oh

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:10,800
my god if anybody can actually modify an

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,930
artificial intelligence machine so the

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,290
results will be unpredictable so these

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,220
are kind of your data so this is a very

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:31,770
quick overview and

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:31,770
