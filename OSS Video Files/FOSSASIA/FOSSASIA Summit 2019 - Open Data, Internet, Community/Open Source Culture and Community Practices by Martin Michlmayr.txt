People often speak about THE open source community but there are actually many open source communities which differ in a number of ways, including aspects related to technology, processes, governance and philosophy. Each open source community has its own culture and norms. In this talk, we'll talk about open source culture and community norms and discuss how to get started contributing to open source. I'll use Debian as an example of one open source community but the lessons learned will be applicable to other projects.
