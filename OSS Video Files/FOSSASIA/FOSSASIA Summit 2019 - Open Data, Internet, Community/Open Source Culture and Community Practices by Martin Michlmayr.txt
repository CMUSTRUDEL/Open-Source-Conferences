Title: Open Source Culture and Community Practices by Martin Michlmayr
Publication date: 2019-04-01
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Open Data, Internet, Community
Description: 
	17 March 2019 13:50, Lecture Theatre

People often speak about THE open source community but there are actually many open source communities which differ in a number of ways, including aspects related to technology, processes, governance and philosophy. Each open source community has its own culture and norms. In this talk, we'll talk about open source culture and community norms and discuss how to get started contributing to open source. I'll use Debian as an example of one open source community but the lessons learned will be applicable to other projects.

hey I think it's a little bit too loud

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,240
so I wanted to talk about social aspects

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,340
of open source and for those of you

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,400
who've been here on Wednesday in the

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,740
main track I gave a small over overview

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,420
so some of the the first slides are the

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,820
same but then I would expand in more

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,039
detail so one of the things I mean open

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,680
source is so popular and and it's just

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,510
such an incredible thing really if you

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,540
think about it there is so much great

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,460
technology but what I really like is the

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,469
whole community around open source like

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,850
coming to a conference like this you

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,129
know meeting people from all around the

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,340
world and just on a daily basis

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,300
participating in open source projects

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,860
collaborating with people all around the

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,250
world it's just it's just really

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,829
exciting but at the same time for people

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,390
who are new to open source sometimes it

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,579
can be a little bit challenging you know

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,199
how do you get started or what are the

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,289
things you have to consider what are the

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,090
things have to avoid so I'm going to

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,650
talk about some of these social aspects

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:11,939
and the first of all a lot of people

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,670
talk about the open source community and

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,470
and I think and I think that's to some

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,330
extent is a mistake

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,310
because there actually many many

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,680
different open source communities and

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,350
they differentiate themselves in many

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,840
different ways so you can you can't

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,479
assume that every open source project

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,009
works in the same way if you look at

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,259
different projects they actually operate

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,270
in different ways and if you want to get

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,670
engaged you need to know what the

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,619
differences are and so some of those

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,470
differences can be in terms of

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,399
technologies right you know some you

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,409
know different programming language is

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,920
or all the different things they do and

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,619
then some differences can be in terms of

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,210
the the infrastructure you know what

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,210
kind of bug tracking system does the

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,960
project use what kind of CI system there

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,229
is a lot of a lot of diversity out there

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,599
even though nowadays we've github I

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:11,670
think I think a lot of projects are

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,100
using the same sort of infrastructure

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,690
and processes but if you look at some of

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,090
the large open-source project they have

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,770
their own infrastructure you know they

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,750
have different bug tracking systems or

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,060
just different ways of doing things and

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,700
then the processes are also different

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,640
like how for example do you submit a

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,780
patch I mean nowadays in many cases it

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,310
just submit a you know a pull request

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,450
but sometimes you have to send patches

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,820
to mailing lists like there are

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,690
different ways of doing things or how do

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,880
you get the the change accepted also how

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,790
do you become you know an official

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,060
developer in the project there are a lot

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,740
of different like a lot of differences

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,680
another area is governance so how does

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,380
the project work how does it operate how

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,030
does it govern itself we have some

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,730
projects where you have sort of a

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,490
committee some projects which has

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,860
several you know core members core

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,850
contributors and in some projects where

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,170
you have like one benevolent dictator

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,630
who at the end of the day makes makes

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,440
the decision another difference is in

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,630
terms of philosophy so and you can see

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,030
that in a number of ways just in how

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,030
projects approach things one good

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,910
example is licensing where on the one

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,030
hand you have permissive license

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,820
projects like bsd apache which basically

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,290
the philosophy is you know freedom open

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,890
source means that you can do whatever

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,440
you want and that includes taking the

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,620
software proprietary but then on the

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,630
other hand you have the like the

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,490
copyleft people who basically say well

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,580
the software the freedom needs to be

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,940
preserved for everyone so that means you

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,070
can't do everything and then another

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,100
difference is the culture just just how

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:09,450
you know the project is how things

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:12,060
happen so playa I'm involved in Debian

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,160
and I can I can tell you a lot of things

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,990
about Debian you know it's one of the

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,430
most popular Linux distributions we have

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,820
a lot of packages we've done a lot of

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,070
cool stuff and and I could go for all of

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,250
that but I'm gonna skip it now because

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,170
when I think of Debian really I think of

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,660
the community I think this is

00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,360
really makes Debian special and you can

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,520
see here a picture of the world where

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,800
the various Debian developers are found

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,530
so we have a lot of people in Europe a

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,990
lot of people in America and then we do

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,420
have some people in Asia although I'd

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,640
like to see more people another picture

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,090
is this once a year we have a conference

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,910
conf and this is from Deb convene in

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,760
Edinburgh and this is really for me what

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,130
Devon is all about those people and I've

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,770
been involved in Debian for about 20

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,650
years now and and some of those people

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,130
have known you know for 20 years and

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,530
it's it's just amazing how you know we

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,860
grow up together we see how people

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:17,040
change and also you know when I travel I

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,020
can I know people everywhere around the

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,750
world you know I can meet up with people

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,400
I can maybe stay at their places and

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,530
this is just really incredible well

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,990
we're open source has allowed me to do

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:33,960
it to understand different cultures work

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:36,750
with those people so community has has a

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,130
number of aspects so one is etiquette

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:43,770
and norms like basically how you behave

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,750
how you you know do things or things you

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,130
shouldn't do then there are also rich

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,590
rituals like you know certain things we

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,170
tend to do which sort of show that you

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,330
are part of this community and another

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,310
thing that's important is history so

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,800
sometimes when you when you when you

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,410
come to a project and you new you look

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,840
at something and you like why are they

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,570
doing things in this particular way like

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,680
it doesn't make sense you know if if you

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,080
would do it you would do it in a

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,840
different way but then you go back in

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,090
history and you see oh but because of

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,090
this thing you know which happened ten

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:25,290
years ago this is why you know things

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,850
are the way they are now and and with

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,530
open-source it is very interesting

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,390
because a lot of the history is actually

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,280
available in you know mailing list

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,100
archives so you can actually find out

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,010
you know why things are the way they are

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,730
and and and then also includes like

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,820
things like like personality conflicts

00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:48,240
I just have to be honest open source I

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,800
mean it involves people and generally we

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,080
want to work together we want to

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,870
collaborate but obviously not everyone

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,420
gets you know along with each other and

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,400
and the history you know that might also

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,800
explain certain things you know maybe

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,910
you know something was implemented to

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,270
work around someone or things like that

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,740
and I mentioned rituals and and actually

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,080
let me go back because this is such a

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,470
good example so you can see here so this

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,520
is in Edinburgh in Scotland where people

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:23,250
were killed and so basically debian got

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,950
some kills done and we actually have our

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,590
own pattern so debian actually has a

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,360
specific killed pattern and it's quite

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,210
interesting because nowadays when you go

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,480
to DEFCON you can always see some people

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,790
wearing you know wearing kilts and if

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,560
you see them you might think oh well

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,750
they probably Scottish right that's why

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,780
they wear it but no actually it's it's a

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,810
debian tradition I mean not everyone

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,970
wears it but some people do and and you

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,420
only understand it again if you look at

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,790
the history of how these things happened

00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,710
and now people peoples are show it to

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,390
show you know that they are part of the

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,340
project that they belong to this

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:06,080
community sometimes you also talk about

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:09,690
tribes you know you belong to this tribe

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,420
so anyway so back to to norms and an

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,810
etiquette so the thing is with humans is

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:19,800
that violating community norms is is

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,050
really bad it just it's very obvious if

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,300
you get something wrong and it's

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,390
interesting with 4-h I'm here in Asia

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,300
because I'm from Europe and when I

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,599
travel to Asia I get things wrong right

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,460
and and again I probably shouldn't even

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,620
say Asia because there's a big

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,330
difference between Singapore and a lot

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,510
of the other countries but for example

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,910
in Europe when I eat noodles you know

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm not allowed to make any noise

00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:50,820
because if I make noise that's impolite

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,870
but I think here you know I have to make

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,930
noise it shows that I I like the

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,170
food and there are a lot of these these

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,390
norms that is like a foreigner you don't

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,050
know you know when I come here I do

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:08,290
things which which violates your norm

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,880
and and it's very obvious but the thing

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,460
is you also see oh you know he's a

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,920
foreigner he is not supposed to know all

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,130
of those things you know you cut me some

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,760
slack and it's the same with open source

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,910
so one example is email because usually

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,190
our interaction is based on email and

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,930
that's how you make your first

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,120
impression they always say you know the

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,440
first impression how you know when you

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,080
meet someone for the first time that's

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,730
the most important and your first

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,830
impression with opal sauce is probably

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,320
going to be on an email on a mailing

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:44,740
list you send an email and some people

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,339
get it wrong and and again I mentioned

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,120
before that there isn't the open-source

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,410
community a lot of the things I say now

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,660
only apply to more traditional

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,540
open-source communities a lot of the

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,110
more newer ones actually are quite

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,540
different in this way but historically

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,700
sending stuff like HTML email to a

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,310
mailing list like people really really

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,040
hated and if you do that it's obvious

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,900
you're a foreigner you know you you

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,010
don't know how the project works you

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,959
know from here you're not one of us some

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,820
some people also send garbled patches

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,570
because they use they use stuff like

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:28,150
Outlook another thing I often see is

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,339
long email footers so especially

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,260
companies they have those legal

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,690
requirements to state you know the

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,420
address and the CEO and all those

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:41,860
details text numbers and it's like 20

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,600
lines of of email and people in the at

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,910
least in the past again things are

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,820
changing really hate that kind of stuff

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,350
and another another example stop posting

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,770
and this is actually a really good

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:57,459
example which also shows that these

00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:00,550
norms change over time so in the past if

00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:03,010
you would top post to a mailing list so

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,440
top post just means that you write you

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,280
reply at you know at the top of the

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,230
email

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,610
like people would really really hate it

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,890
like you would have to do it this way

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,710
you know you quote and then you send you

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:18,480
reply you called some more this is in

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:20,890
line and in a lot of a lot of you know

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,500
traditional open-source communities like

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,710
this is how you have to respond if you

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,240
if you top quote people hated but this

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,940
is actually such a good example things

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,530
changing because now top quoting is

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,310
getting much much much more

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:41,050
you know widely used and I also do it

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,910
sometimes so so what what I'm trying to

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,890
say so I don't know if you noticed this

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,560
comic Where's Waldo

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,350
I think Waldo has different names in you

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,510
know kind of different languages but you

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,670
have to find him somewhere on the

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,860
picture and he's really hard to find and

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,760
and that's what I'm trying to say is

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:04,210
that when you join a community you don't

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,670
wanna stick out in a negative way you

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,940
know you should try to blend in you try

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,310
to learn the culture and do things in in

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,550
the way that the community expects but

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,440
at the same time of course you should

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,000
you should build a reputation for

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,100
yourself you know you should stick out

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,250
in a positive way by making a good

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:30,190
contribution so I wanted to talk a

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,760
little bit about corporate involvement

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,580
and because it's it's getting much more

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,100
common nowadays that people like

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,570
software engineers who have like a

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,460
traditional corporate background and

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,320
they are being told oh you know you

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,839
should work on this open source project

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,440
we want to get engaged you know can you

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:54,550
start working on this open source

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,650
project and the culture between you know

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,050
a corporate environment where you do

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,540
in-house development can be quite

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,339
different to the open source world and

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,430
sometimes that's a big learning curve

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,400
for people so one example is writing

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:13,570
down information in open source we

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,780
really like writing down everything we

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:19,420
enjoy you know communicating on a

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,080
mailing lists which are archived or in

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,240
chats

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,940
which are archived and this has a lot of

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,100
benefits because other people can get

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,950
involved they can read what's going on

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,530
and they can participate but a lot of a

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,930
lot of the corporate culture is to just

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:38,200
you know get a room and talk about stuff

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,930
and sometimes corporations even avoid

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,030
writing down stuff because you know they

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,770
don't want to be taking accountable

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,020
later

00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:50,140
another thing is distributed development

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,840
versus co-located development so if if

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,200
the whole team is in the same building

00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:00,910
you know you get used to just shouting

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,170
across the aisle and again if everyone

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,540
is in the same building

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,460
you just get a meeting you talk about it

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,080
and then everyone knows what's going on

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,860
but there's no need to really write it

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,770
down but we hope saws we always need to

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,110
write things down and sometimes we meet

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,330
at conferences and have you know chats

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,100
in person but then it's important to go

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,600
back to the mailing list to document

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,430
what you have discussed what you've

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,560
decided because there are a lot of

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,970
people from a project who won't be able

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,250
to be at the conference technology is

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,290
obviously are different as well

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,510
but I think the know learning the open

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:42,340
source technologies and tools is very

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:45,910
easy and something that some people need

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,090
to do is if they work in a in a

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,180
corporate environment they need to adopt

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,340
different styles you know if you if you

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,140
work internally you know in the

00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,020
corporate environment you have to behave

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,300
a certain way you have to follow their

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,310
traditions and their rules but then if

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,020
you work on the open source project you

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,270
have to adopt a different style and you

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,850
have to do what they do so this is sort

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,680
of a skill that you you need to you know

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:17,320
work in different ways depending on on

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:20,050
what you do another big differences is

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,050
being open community is all about being

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:26,890
open you know the work is is in the open

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,450
and and this to be honest can be a big

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,360
challenge for people especially if

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,980
you're new to open source because

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,290
internally if you

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,120
the patch yeah your colleagues your

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,889
manager might review it they might give

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,079
you some feedback you may have to change

00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,360
it but if you do it in open source uh

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,850
Dhin Li the whole world can look at your

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,880
changes and they can critique them right

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,949
and this stuff is archived you know

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,760
forever and this can be a little bit

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:56,769
scary and and again there's also

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,199
cultural thing because like for example

00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:02,920
in American the US you know they're

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,290
quite direct with giving feedback and

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,480
they can be quite blunt whereas in some

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,269
Asian cultures it's you know it's all

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,850
about saving face and you know saying

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,529
things indirectly so this is a big

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,600
challenge I think for a lot of Asian

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,089
contributors to be involved in open

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,790
source which are really like the culture

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:26,589
is very very Western dominated in many

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:29,829
ways another thing which which is like

00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:32,920
it like a challenge for some people but

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:34,839
I find it really rewarding is that we

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,139
hope source you work with your

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,769
competitors like obviously your

00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:44,440
companies compete on some in some ways

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,589
but on the open source project you might

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,510
collaborate you know with them so if you

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,389
look at the Linux kernel you know that

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:57,130
has people from Intel and AMD working

00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:59,620
together side by side IBM and HP are

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,709
working on Linux side-by-side but then

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,990
they compete in other areas so this is

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:07,660
something which which is very you know

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,990
unusually in a way and I actually have

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,049
this example so I have a friend and he

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,540
used to work at HP so I used to work at

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:19,390
HP we both worked at HP and he was

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,699
working on the Linux kernel and then one

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,339
day he moved on I can't remember he

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,140
moved to Google or Red Hand but he still

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:29,020
continued working on the Linux kernel

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,299
and so he told me that his his family

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,360
asked also you changed jobs what are you

00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:36,820
doing now and he said oh I do exactly

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,860
the same I do before you know I worked

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,540
on the newest kind of before and I work

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,630
on the next kind of now and they were

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,620
like how can you change employer and

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,590
still do the same stuff

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,380
and and and yeah and I think it's

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,539
incredible because again it comes back

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,690
to friendships even though we change

00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:59,000
employers you know my friends they still

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,429
stay around in the same you know

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,700
environment yeah we might work for

00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:07,240
different employers but we all work on

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,240
the same project

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:16,130
yeah documentation NDA can be a problem

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:18,380
with like corporate involvement so one

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,510
of the questions is why should you get

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,390
involved in open source in the first

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,279
place because open source it means you

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,890
know you can do anything you can take

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:31,010
the software you can modify it

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,740
internally in your corporate environment

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,730
there is no need there is no requirement

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,520
to give it back but there are a lot of

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,710
benefits in doing so because at the end

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,350
of the day upstream so upstream is

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,230
basically the project where you get the

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,350
software from they are the authoritative

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,110
source so if you make changes internally

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,299
the project just doesn't stand still and

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,059
they also move on and they make changes

00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:04,130
and then for you it's a it's a huge

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:06,590
maintenance requirement to you know get

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,080
you changes into the new version but

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,570
instead if you take your changes and you

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,279
put them upstream then you can just

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,270
adopt the new version we've had any

00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:20,419
changes and in fact other people might

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:24,700
get involved and improve the changes you

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:27,830
have made so so one of the things I see

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,980
in terms of corporations getting

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:34,130
involved in open-source is they don't

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:38,090
understand that in the long term

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:41,029
open-source pays off but in the short

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,950
term it can be more work because you

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,990
need to get up to speed to contributing

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,299
to the project you need to do all that

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,270
work to get your changes in and that's a

00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:52,340
lot of work but in the long term it

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,049
makes things so much easier for you so

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,210
this is sometimes the challenge

00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,370
explaining to management know why you

00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,100
need work

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:05,950
best all of the time now well because it

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,530
pays off in the long term another

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,530
another reason for getting into involves

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:14,020
upstream is getting new ideas I always I

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,690
mean you know some of the big companies

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,850
like Google they hire a lot of smart

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,920
people right but there is no single

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,680
company that can hire all this more

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,200
smart people in the world and again

00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,030
that's the beauty of open source is that

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,100
you know you have all those smart people

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,540
working on the same project and it

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,450
doesn't really matter who they work for

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,820
you get those ideas from all of those

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:41,770
people and you can also also contribute

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,770
your ideas so how how to get started

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:47,590
with open source so it's very hard to

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,960
give like a step-by-step how-to because

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,600
a lot of the things depend on the

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,059
project your every project works in the

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,150
different way so the way you get engaged

00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:02,080
the way you contribute are very specific

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:04,390
to the project but obviously some of the

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,480
things are generic so one thing I always

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,390
recommend is that people start by using

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,250
the software and then when you use the

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,860
software I'm sure you're gonna find

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,960
things that don't work and then you can

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,059
find a bug report or maybe the

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,640
documentation is that current and you

00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:25,090
can improve it and the more you have

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:29,290
about the more opportunities you find to

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:32,050
get involved another thing that's

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,750
important is that in open-source you

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,760
have to be very independent the reason

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,070
really anyone in open-source who tells

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,010
you oh you know you should be doing this

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,350
you should be doing this it's very like

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,150
people very self determined like you get

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,750
involved you do something and you

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,120
contribute it so don't wait around for

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:55,870
people to tell you what to do just do

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,720
something and and I mean a lot of

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,670
projects nowadays try to make it easier

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,950
by having sort of mentorship programs

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:08,410
where they either describe certain

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,990
things that are easy to do you know here

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,290
are some bug reports which are easy to

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,470
feel

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,270
or here is you know documentation area

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,870
that can be improved and also they

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:22,090
provide guidance like they work with you

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,980
to get you up to speed but a lot of

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,100
projects don't have that so you just

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:30,880
need to get started and then and then

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:34,270
contribute and see how things work so

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,850
one of one of my advice is find a niche

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,340
find something that hasn't been done

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,950
before because if you just do something

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:45,670
which everyone does well you can make a

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,990
contribution but it's it's gonna be you

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,260
know but if you do something completely

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:53,800
different then you know your impact is

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,530
much higher so and in open-source

00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,900
there's always something to do like no

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,180
software project is perfect right no

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,190
project is finished there is always

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,500
something you can contribute so just

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,780
start by using the project and you're

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,530
gonna find a ton of stuff that you can

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,750
improve one of the really nice things

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,060
about open source is that as you get

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,790
engaged in projects you build up a

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,310
reputation you know people start to

00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:27,880
recognize your name and if you do a good

00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:29,950
work they will record work they know

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,660
they can trust you they know that if you

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,880
do something it's going to be high

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,740
quality and the great thing is that

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,590
right that reputation if you want to

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,120
change employers that stays with you

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,970
you know people can look at your your

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,190
github you know repository or then only

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:50,470
your name and it makes it really easy to

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:53,170
get new jobs so how do you get involved

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,940
so one of the things I always say is I

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,610
mean I'm sure you're eager to get

00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,440
involved you just want to start but take

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:03,040
things slow the first thing you should

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,260
do is observe observe how the project

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,750
operates and the great thing is we hope

00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,610
so this is very easy to do you can just

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,250
subscribe to a number of mailing lists

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:15,490
and you can read and then you can see

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:18,610
how people interact how do people

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,130
discuss how do people make decisions who

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,290
are the people who have influence in the

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,490
project you see all of these just by

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,710
observing

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:31,660
you know the meeting these conversations

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,970
and try to understand the culture try to

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,720
figure out how the project works and

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:40,030
don't assume that it works a certain way

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,360
that it works like a company or that it

00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:46,360
works like LA cañada open source project

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:52,030
and yeah if you make changes then

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:55,740
contribute them back so that's it so I

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,740
think we have some time for questions

00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,710
these have

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:58,860
thank you one idea that I've been that

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:02,700
I've been toying around with is for for

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:06,360
companies to more so traditional

00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:12,690
companies to implement an open-source

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:15,560
culture within the company itself I'm

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:20,640
just wondering if you have seen this

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:22,560
done anywhere so so make sure that

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,630
there's no sort of clans is that the

00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,340
company if people are open about the

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,530
work that they're doing and invite other

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,410
departments in to come and take a look

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:35,310
and for quotes with my company and then

00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:37,530
spin that off see see the advantage of

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,570
having multiple stakeholders and

00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,120
contributors and then spin that off in

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:48,540
finally into an external project after

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:52,290
the momentum has been built out I think

00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:55,170
there are there are two things I see so

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,780
one of them is called inner sauce which

00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:01,890
is basically where companies adopt open

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,350
source methodologies internally so you

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:07,230
know they use stuff like like git and

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,540
pull requests and and and bug bug

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,220
tracking systems and and basically they

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,760
adopt open source methodologies

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,860
internally but sometimes it is for

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,680
proprietary code so there's never any

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,960
plan to actually you know absolutely get

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,230
it open so like getting out out out of

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,970
the door it's just internally to

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:31,050
facilitate collaboration and for example

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:36,210
when I worked at HP we actually bought a

00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:37,980
license for github to create these this

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,960
environment and people were saying like

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,270
I mean it was like a big company with

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,240
300,000 people and it was like you know

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,370
why are there so many sylars why are the

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,140
different teams not working together why

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,830
do we not know what the other people are

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,360
doing and by having these inner source

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,370
you know some of those challenges can be

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,890
addressed but then I think the other

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,500
thing is which i think is more aligned

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:05,010
to what you said is is where people sort

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:08,880
of start doing open-source intern

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,630
but with the plan to eventually get it

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,780
out there

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:15,660
so one thing for example I sees that you

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,179
might have a team where you have some

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,440
experienced open-source developers and

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,540
some people who don't have the

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,240
experience and basically they provide

00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,240
some internal coaching so you do stuff

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,600
internally there's internal code review

00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,240
and once the the team decides yeah it's

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,780
ready then you approach the episodes

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,010
project you actually submit it outside

00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,330
but but yeah like the whole inner source

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:44,730
model is is getting quite quite popular

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,220
and and hopefully some of that will be

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,809
released as open source as well but some

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,820
of it is just you know proprietary

00:28:48,809 --> 00:29:01,910
software development done in like a more

00:28:50,820 --> 00:29:01,910
modern way actually I have a question

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:09,330
email lists NPR's so those have kind of

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,280
a personal comment or like information

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:17,880
though does it

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:19,980
anything violate gdpr so this this is

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,900
actually a really big topic for a lot of

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,190
open source projects right now because

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,600
we have traditionally relied on I mean

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,600
open source is all about being open

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:35,210
about being transparent we don't want to

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:38,160
hide you know problems or things so we

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:41,400
you know the whole idea is to archive

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,919
staff as as well as much as possible but

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,620
at the same time you know projects need

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,500
to comply with with you know the law and

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:52,200
and so now you know if someone wants

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:56,970
something removed the project will have

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,940
to do that I don't think I think it

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,040
takes some more time to see how it pans

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,410
out in reality I don't think we have

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,270
seen like a lot of you know requests for

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:10,049
removal but it's definitely something

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:12,650
that the various projects are aware and

00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,650
working on

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,710
[Music]

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,650
okay okay thanks so much yeah thank you

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,870
please give what I won't have have lost

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,870
