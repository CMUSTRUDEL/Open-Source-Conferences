so my name is Thao I come from my

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:10,230
research if I advisory so first of all

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,179
if my voice seemed a little shaky please

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,610
note that it is because you know the

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,250
cold atmosphere around here that's not

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,949
because I'm exciting or anything yeah

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,460
but some reason every time it come to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:28,529
give a speech and so it's cool

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,050
so I come from a bar research research

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,870
is a company we're doing research in

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,780
Thailand about financial stuff but

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,329
mostly the thing is algo it's not just

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,309
limited to finance we want to improve

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,550
our country we want to do something good

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,910
for Thailand and this is why we start

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,590
new projects apart from finance which is

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,829
Vulcan Vulcan is a project that we want

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,289
to to bring the disabled people to come

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,829
in to data science stuff we want to use

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,070
the their special ability like the blind

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,110
who realize that they should have the

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,229
ability to hear better than other people

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,740
or you know you can imagine a lot of

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,840
stuff and and we we used them to to

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,180
label data for us force for training the

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,830
AI or or anything useful for business

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,659
that's why we start with a little more

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,020
people we have and try to build

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,090
something useful for people for me apart

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,030
form about can we also have another

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,220
project which is called agile Paul it's

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,040
a project that we want to track the

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,360
movement of dogs or cats in our shelters

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,820
because we wanted to know that behavior

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,270
and stopping something like that this is

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:49,020
kind of like the herbal idea of what

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,460
what research we are doing in a bar so

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,470
we use of a lot of a lot of open sources

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,560
why what do you eat why do we use a lot

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,719
of open source is it's good apart from

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,659
being free yes of course and so it is

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,229
free right we have everything but the

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,149
thing is we use opens open source stuff

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,940
because it's transparent

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,280
we don't want everything we develop to

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,070
contain you know flowers

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,260
or box and when we deliver things to to

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,340
customers we don't want it to you know

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,400
explore in their faces and damage our

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,100
reputation that's why because open

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,890
search we can analyze we can take a look

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,750
at the court and and scrutinize until we

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,830
make sure that everything is you know

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,870
work in our scope of work out resize

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,090
scope that's why that's the major reason

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,900
why we think the open source stuff is

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,350
very good and one you know Python sure

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,680
thing we use also to enter fro with

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,690
other Python ecosystem and and also the

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,640
Cassandra and Hydra and stuff a lot of

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,180
things but that the thing is the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,250
greatest open sort of all perhaps is

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,470
mathematics right mathematic is open

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,890
source we have code we have theory we

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,420
have everything the thing is in in 19th

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,370
centuries that is started at the

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,920
beginning of 19th century we everyone

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,470
know David Hubert he's a very very

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,019
famous mathematicians of of all time I

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,530
can say that David Hubert has a dream

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,980
the dream to prove that every mathematic

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,260
Theory every axioms contains whether is

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,060
we contain paradox something that

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,810
mathematicians mathematicians sort of

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,110
like at all

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,989
paradox who kind of like a box of law in

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,000
in in program it can explore if we

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,190
develop a lot of theory and in explored

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,870
then this does the thing that we work

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:48,299
will become useless so that's why David

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,890
Hubert try to make sure that everything

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:55,560
has no can be proved can be has no box

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:59,310
has no flaws but it's turned out that he

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,530
can thank to the air force of Allen so

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,780
shirt go to occurred and and Alan Turing

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,180
who invented come people who theory

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,459
invented computer we know we now knows

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,360
and used today but the thing is because

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,799
we can prove does mean we must realize

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,660
on the community to to to verify

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,450
everything that we were that's why I

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,849
think the idea of developing open source

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,220
kind of like a line with a goal of

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,500
mathematics to to open to every other

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,449
people

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,150
that is why I think that it goes of the

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:37,319
the only way for open-sourced up to to

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:41,669
become larger to gain more people is

00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,389
forest to use it to adopt it to take

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,389
care of it

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,310
to mature until his mature and then

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,860
release it back to the community

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,990
we give it back to the society that I

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,539
think that's the only way that open

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,909
source stuff like mathematics pi

00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:01,610
thoughts and therefore everything can

00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:04,830
truly emerging as one with proven and

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:09,270
for for improving our whole way of life

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,340
for Humanities and for the rest of the

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:17,909
world thank you that's just you know

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:20,460
rambling I have nothing to say much so I

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,379
know it's gonna be a hard for asking

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,120
question here but I will be willing to

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,120
answer anything thank you

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,580
yes

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,960
sure for the blind people we want we

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,060
want did that the AI that we want to

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,980
train it's a tech to a speech we want

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,350
you know in in high you know even though

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,960
in English everything is good we have

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,940
models and take from google web net and

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,580
stubborn and Rani's with the word but

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,800
the thing is to train take to speech in

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,870
high that's very hard because we don't

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,510
have much data the data we have is just

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,070
you know like most of them is customers

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,450
that feedback some some complain some

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,250
like compliment something like that

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,580
but we want more we want to train to

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,130
Texas page 52 to read the books or even

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,470
go for a text books but but those thing

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,690
because they data are not like a line

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,120
there that from the data set we have so

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,580
that's why that's why it's very very

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,280
hard trained detective speaking in Thai

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,370
and that's why we had to gather we have

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,090
to to accumulate ly gather data from

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:40,410
from from scratch and and I think using

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,900
the blind people who who who and who the

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:48,240
end highlights live in the world of

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:50,370
darkness who has to only use ear to

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,470
navigate around the world to understand

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,900
the things tough to perceive the world

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,630
at they are that's why I think they must

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,790
have some some kind of perspective

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,780
sharper keener perspective than the rest

00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:06,390
of us that's why if we take the current

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,030
day that they are right now and combine

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,610
them use their power to train the AI to

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:15,630
process the data for us then we give it

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,440
AI does it's very strong very actually

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:21,060
and be able to you know that's a part as

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,880
a part of project is that we want to

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:30,680
bring opens let the brine come back to

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,680
