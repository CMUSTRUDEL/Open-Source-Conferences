Digital content creation software selections for visual effects was always dominated by a few organizations: Adobe, Autodesk for example. Nowaday, every one of them has adopted the subscription based business model, so users have no other options but to keep paying rental fee for continuous usage of their software.I was aware of the situation so I began my search for alternatives many years ago. Granted, it was a bumpy ride, but it’s worth it in the end. Now I do not rely on the so called ‘mainstream’ software to produce industry standard work thanks to the FOSS community. And I’d like to share my story with you.
