	Boonsak Watanavisit

Digital content creation software selections for visual effects was always dominated by a few organizations: Adobe, Autodesk for example. Nowaday, every one of them has adopted the subscription based business model, so users have no other options but to keep paying rental fee for continuous usage of their software.I was aware of the situation so I began my search for alternatives many years ago. Granted, it was a bumpy ride, but it’s worth it in the end. Now I do not rely on the so called ‘mainstream’ software to produce industry standard work thanks to the FOSS community. And I’d like to share my story with you.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,660
good afternoon I'll be very quick

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:11,179
because I have 40 pages to skim through

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,070
in 20 minutes so I'm gonna be quick

00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:17,160
first these these sessions we're gonna

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,380
talk about how I use the free and open

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,779
source software in the visual effects

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:29,429
industry to do professional works so

00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:31,949
first okay about me my name is boon sack

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:38,670
what a novice it or you can call me leo

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:42,379
I am back please okay

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,050
I am visual effects supervisor and

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:49,670
animation director storyboard artist

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,879
screenwriter sometimes voice talent and

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,629
everything about the video production I

00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:01,050
have done it all everything but a

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,559
programmer although I can buy some few

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,630
lines of Python script I never consider

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,790
myself a programmer anyway you can

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,950
contact me at my email here oh I don't

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,640
know if you want my email you can

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,560
contact me later okay next this is what

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,290
I have been doing for the past 20 years

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,950
I have been doing visual effects in this

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:33,299
film if you're from abroad you mean you

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:40,400
may not know them but is they are very

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:44,610
popular film in Thailand so I also do

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:50,369
some editing of film editor in in this

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,689
film also okay we'll talk about what are

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,780
the common software's

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,920
use in the digital content creation

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,610
I have categorized them into many

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,420
categories

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,210
at first we talked about the OS the

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,670
common OS in the industry of course

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,230
Windows or Mac so some might say that

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,410
professionally used Mac but that's not

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,180
the

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,640
yes because you can buy all kind of

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:25,200
system in in production house next there

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,740
are you had to use some kind of raster

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,470
image editor and there's no doubt the

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,770
for the shop it ruled the world nobody

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:38,520
nobody never know the Photoshop for

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:43,800
retouching for drawing or painting this

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:48,690
is a one and only application that

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:54,350
everyone turned to for logo and graphic

00:02:48,690 --> 00:03:01,770
design Adobe Illustrator is the one so

00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:06,180
also for the typography for the text the

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:10,250
compositor is used for combining images

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,230
together doing some green screen keying

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,640
extract subject from the back background

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,810
and add some text some local some

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:25,110
effects to the image image so the

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:28,890
popular software are Adobe After Effects

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:31,620
or in case of the larger studio where

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,670
composite compositing is more complex

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:39,150
they might use nuke from the boundary or

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:45,560
maybe some of them use a flame from

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:48,300
Autodesk and we onto the animation part

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,900
the there are two kinds of animation

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:59,910
we're talking about 3d and 2d animation

00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:02,400
3d is dominated by Autodesk they have to

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,940
two major software that dominate the

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,450
area

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,360
Maya and three years max when Maya Maya

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:15,090
is used for character animation and film

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:18,620
and TV TV 3ds max conquer the the Aqua

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,840
which architectural pre-visualization

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,510
because of is maybe and I don't know

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,380
maybe it's because it's plug-in that can

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:32,130
render out realistic image

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:36,120
for 2d animation Toon Boom has been in

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:41,930
the industry for many years and it's

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:45,960
been standardized next we need some

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:52,590
simulation software to simulate smoke

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:58,290
the fluid and crown side effect Houdini

00:04:52,590 --> 00:05:02,940
is the best software used for smoke

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,060
simulation while real flow is that where

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:10,020
you go to for the fluid simulation and

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:13,200
for the crown massive massive prime is

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,600
the software used behind the in the

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,450
Hollywood film many major Hollywood film

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:25,350
use massive for the crown simulation

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:28,010
scene and we also need video editor to

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:32,880
names that comes up very often to

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:35,010
there's the final cut from the Apple is

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,090
very is the most popular among the

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:42,060
professional because professional use

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:44,520
max then Final Cut is seems more stable

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:50,610
than Premiere it doesn't hang as often

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:54,120
as premiere and next for the color

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:58,050
grading is about changing the colors of

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,650
the film a beautify the image we have

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,070
davinci resolve from Blackmagic resolve

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:08,220
has been in business for many many years

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:12,330
back then this they sell the resort as a

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,760
turnkey system include software with the

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:18,330
hardware and service nowaday they

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:21,510
release the software site for free but

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,270
with some limitation so you can try out

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,880
the resolve yourself at home but you

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,550
know with without a deacon control panel

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,539
the hardware side you can try software

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,539
on your own

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,530
okay that's good thing we have many

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,380
options to choose from but what's wrong

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:46,030
with them what's wrong with the

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,860
proprietary software first as you as you

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,220
can see they are owned by a few

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:57,090
organization which is may not be good

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:59,230
for competition and most of them

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:03,510
subscription-based you have to pay

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:07,650
monthly fee to use them or they can be

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:11,220
highly priced very expensive to acquire

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:16,240
except for GG resort which is free and

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:21,610
the pro version is quite cheap also now

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:24,730
come the most important aspect of the

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,150
using commission software for me is

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,370
about the assets on a chip because when

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,200
you create your asset your art your

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,550
drawing something in Photoshop your file

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,680
is in Photoshop format if you run out of

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,440
your subscription for Photoshop you

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,830
cannot open your files anymore so your

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,310
files are held ransom by the software

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,770
company if you don't pay for using your

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,370
software you cannot open your art

00:07:50,770 --> 00:08:01,380
anymore this is the questionable aspect

00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:05,500
of the software asset ownership the last

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:09,250
point is the hidden cost called the

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,560
third-party plugin most software can

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:15,190
operate on their own but to get the best

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,480
result they rely on some third-party

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:22,600
plugin notable notably the after-effects

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,880
on their own it cannot do much but there

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:30,280
are lots of plugins for After Effects

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:34,620
you have to buy and in combination they

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,830
might cost more than the software itself

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,790
so with all this a flaw do we have

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:47,270
alternatives across the answer is yes

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:52,030
and no in some area let's ops let's act

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:56,780
explore the first the OS of quads Linux

00:08:52,030 --> 00:09:05,960
I've been using Linux for seven years

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:07,850
also yes but the the distro I like is is

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,730
the actual base distro which is a

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,500
rolling release so you have don't have

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,130
to reinstall system every couple years

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:21,320
it's just update and you get the recent

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:23,540
version unlike the Ubuntu we're in maybe

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,880
in five years you have to reinstall the

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,200
whole system to get the the latest

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:35,540
version and I think the art is more

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,650
stable for raster image nothing can

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,400
replace for the shop

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:43,300
anyway but we can get by with

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,100
combination from Kim and guida

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,080
personally I like critter more for for a

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,590
painting job but for the retouching for

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:59,320
manipulating the photo

00:09:51,590 --> 00:10:05,810
Kim has done better job this is the

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:10,510
symbol of work I have been using critter

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,790
and this is project Rama avatar we

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,760
take the wall art from what prekow

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:20,420
the royal temple and move them and

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,760
create the animation 15-minute summation

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,120
I am responsible for the only five

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,880
minutes but that five minutes is or full

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,470
open-source you know

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:35,450
remember this project we'll come back to

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:39,430
it later the drama of Azhar okay the

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,860
factory image editor and this area is

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:47,170
questionable because Inkscape has been

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,460
around for so long but I feel the is

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:53,930
development recently and has been

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:58,340
stagnate it doesn't improve in in many

00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:00,470
years so you can do a simple job like

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,850
drawing vector graphics

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:08,300
but when it comes to professional words

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:12,650
the major flaw is it doesn't read the

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:16,420
CMYK color space from from Illustrator

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:19,940
which is required for the printing job

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:23,870
the customers local always come in CMYK

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:27,080
color space and inscape cannot read that

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,300
which is a little and I have to keep a

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,950
copy of my old version of the

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:37,190
illustrative just for this purpose this

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,620
is the job I have been using the

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:43,840
Inkscape to create the assets to draw

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:49,610
this kind of crap graphics to use in

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:55,070
animation so you can use each grade in

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:57,440
scale to draw this kind of art we don't

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,260
have the time to watch them all so I'm

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,960
gonna skip it

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,620
next the compositor for combining images

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,910
together it comes as a surprise that I

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:15,380
chose blender for this task but blender

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:18,860
is surprisingly stable for this job it

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:23,900
has a node based system like like the

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,430
same workflow as new so you can get if

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,670
you can get your head around the

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:35,120
workflow you can go to work with nope

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:39,260
just fine I have been using blender

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,890
compositor for many years for every job

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:50,060
I have done for the past seven years so

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:53,270
there are many job with that for the

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,250
animation of course blender because this

00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:00,050
is the main strength of the blender

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:03,050
itself it says the animation suite in

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,620
the recent worse version the 2.80 it

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,990
adds the capability of doing the frame

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,470
by frame to the animation so you can do

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,180
the kind of anime style Japanese anime

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,340
style

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:21,550
with in blender - these are my words

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:26,350
with using when I've used blender you

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:30,310
can bear 2d and those that

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:36,930
Nakano upper corner one is 2d with frame

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:41,680
by frame animation for simulation

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,530
blender again it's a no smoke simulation

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,450
simulator in blender is good enough for

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:53,560
simple tasks but for more complex sauces

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:58,210
is quite lacking it's lower so and the

00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:01,920
fluid stimulation is just acceptable but

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:06,790
the good news is there is a third-party

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,560
plugin for simulating the fluid is being

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,810
developed right now and it's amazing

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,720
because it uses the same algorithm as

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:22,140
the Commission software but the major

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,210
pitfall is the crown simulation it is

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,390
non-existent right now you can do some

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:31,480
some dumb prowl walking around

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,880
mindlessly when bump into each other and

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,830
piercing through each other but not the

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,780
way massive handle there the crown

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:43,780
massive has a smart actor which the

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:47,440
actor can sense the terrain and climb up

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,140
the stairs comedy hill and when

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,050
encountered add another actor they can

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:56,800
fight or they can run that that that how

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,980
smart they are but we don't have that

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,330
kind of system in in any open source

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:09,000
software so this is lacking and I'm

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,000
baking you developer get me please

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:18,670
this sample of my work when I this is

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:21,640
not my expertise doing the simulation so

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,980
I only do that the basic one like a

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,980
billowing smoke and that's all

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:39,429
video editor blender again why because

00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,589
it's simple enough and is and doesn't it

00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:45,910
support many format and that doesn't

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:49,149
require you any more set up than other

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:52,179
software you can just drag any video in

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:55,929
and cut and add some transitions and

00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:59,439
that's fine but it's lacking the

00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:02,259
professional features such as important

00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:05,559
exporting some code to be able to work

00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:09,759
with the other other departments such as

00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:13,649
sound and color grading facility so it's

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:17,970
only good for amateur editor editing is

00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:23,339
not good enough for professional works

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:29,470
but I managed to use the video editor to

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:35,679
do some basic editing in no I did not do

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:38,439
this I I edited the animatic which mean

00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,609
this moving storyboard draw the image

00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:44,470
and put it in in sequence in sequence

00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:47,679
before before you make the real

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,639
animation it's called an animatic so but

00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,350
with basic editing is fine you can

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,489
arrange the image on the timeline and

00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:00,759
add some text and add some voiceover

00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:02,949
that's that's good enough for this kind

00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,279
of task but when you want to cooperate

00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:13,809
with the professional in other area is

00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:17,409
is lacking now come to the area that we

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:20,589
see really lacking the alternatives is

00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:28,019
the color grading department we don't

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:32,200
have any solution for this nothing No

00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:36,940
but luckily results is free so I can get

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,940
by with that but I really like some open

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:49,929
source color grading software

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:53,350
really please any I think because of the

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:56,230
the facility you need you need to you

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,260
need to adjust your screen you need to

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,269
profile your monitor and every a

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,640
projector out there you need your

00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:08,649
caliper front of them to be able to

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:12,760
correct the color you know so is it Rick

00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:16,179
I don't know maybe it's a lot about

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,179
about like data gathering it may be its

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:22,149
cost too much I don't know I don't know

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:30,130
why anyone hasn't haven't been there on

00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:33,840
this subject okay now the good the bad

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:37,419
and the ugly of the open source software

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,260
benefit of course is free the main

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:43,659
benefits right and it's fast when we

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,019
compare the Linux to Windows is

00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:50,340
obviously that Linux is faster at least

00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:54,760
in blender it works faster in Linux now

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,460
and it's fun for I think for most of you

00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,460
and this just out there it's fun to use

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,720
the software that you can tinker can

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,880
modify to suit your needs and it's also

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,330
simple to install and to maintain

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,299
there's no license manager or extra

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:17,559
processes to run in background so your

00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:20,830
your computer is doing light work just

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,799
running your software you use and it's

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,799
safer because there's no bloatware

00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:32,649
install you can choose which components

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:35,139
you want and wish to left out and the

00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:39,029
most important point for me is the asset

00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:42,730
you truly own your assets you can have

00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:45,070
your assets pack in your archive and

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,820
along with the software you use that's

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:51,490
how I have my project I put everything

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,510
in a snow hardest along with the

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,110
software

00:19:52,510 --> 00:20:00,010
they are used for that project and I can

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,210
I can be sure that I can open my asset

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,510
any time I like

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:10,210
without paying for the subscription or

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:12,310
anything okay when talking to the

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,360
clients the writing directors or

00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:18,700
producers they good news they don't care

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,180
what you use they just want the results

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,080
if you can do deliver the job they don't

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,400
care what you use in fact there also

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,360
when the peak and my screen they also

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,900
Wow

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:38,770
what are you using is looks cool

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:41,460
yes that's Linux and when you talk to

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,710
the investors or business owner

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,300
they also Wow at first when they were

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:51,510
here at the software as there are

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:55,330
skeptic to what's the catch the catch is

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:58,030
for establish of established business

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:01,030
they have their own pipeline already

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:04,000
done for many years and switching to

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,810
open-source software they need to change

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,050
all that and that might be set back for

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:14,470
their business and also the part of

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:18,430
ditching out their software the deputy

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:22,360
the purchase expect with offensive

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:24,280
scores so might be scary oh I paid for

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,270
that thousand dollars I have to dish

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,220
them all away

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:35,200
that's scary and for the new business

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:38,020
that they are they are afraid of being

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,640
left alone using their relatively

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:45,700
unknown software and when when the when

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,880
it need help they don't know who or

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,950
where to turn to and that the pain point

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,950
for not using the open source software

00:21:53,790 --> 00:22:00,550
when you talk to your co-workers or the

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:04,990
co production company they are also

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:07,179
looking for cooperation they need the

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,090
company

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:15,230
that used the same pipeline as them they

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:19,940
need the assets to be able to work

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:22,970
together with with their assets so to be

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,400
able to encourage the use of open-source

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,410
software we need to ensure that our

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:33,020
assets are interchangeable with the

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:36,040
proprietary software like the PSD file

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,840
Photoshop files can be open and

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,590
displayed the same result in both

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:47,900
Photoshop and IAM and Krita and whatever

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:51,169
and with these other SS - the hardest

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,200
part is the 3d models because the Maya

00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:57,730
format the mbm a is a proprietary and

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:02,480
they won't release the specification so

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:06,260
no one can hack them and and get to read

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:13,070
them properly that the things you

00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:17,720
consider well for technical directors

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:21,890
their job is to ensure that the pipeline

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,040
in the company works flawlessly so they

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,570
always always skeptical that isn't the

00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,980
open source software still in

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:33,410
development is its finish so you are the

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,990
developers you know that that there's no

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,870
finished software they're all released

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,480
release cycle of the software right you

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,360
feature freeze and release and develop

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,280
the new features and release so there's

00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,010
no finished software the only finished

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:55,059
software is the date one so we can I

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:59,770
don't know for the open minded take

00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:59,770
director we can discuss this

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:08,330
okay now back to you how can you help

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,610
with the situation of course I have

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,380
already mentioned some of the area that

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,190
needs help

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,270
and you can join the establish developer

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,270
community

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:23,210
I suggest look into blender community it

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:28,820
has it is well organized and recently

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:32,510
get major funding from AMD and epic with

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:39,380
Unreal Engine so they have a lot of

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:41,690
money to poor way to you and if you

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,720
don't want to work with the community

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:48,020
you can also develop the air on a

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,650
plug-ins on your own and it's better

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:54,770
than recreating the kind of software

00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:57,530
from ground up because it takes time

00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:00,830
maybe many years before your your new

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,860
software gets to be get to the public

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:08,510
and maybe you wither down along the way

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:13,330
before it gets released now come to

00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:17,660
welcome to my not so well hidden agenda

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,790
remember the Rama Rama what are the

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,270
ameba film the creator of the project

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:26,180
Rama votar need to discuss with Dilip

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:30,050
developer team to develop a new open

00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:32,920
source tool for the next project which

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:36,790
involves the AI for image processing

00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:40,310
scripts to automate it the certain task

00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:42,550
assessment management system and maybe
