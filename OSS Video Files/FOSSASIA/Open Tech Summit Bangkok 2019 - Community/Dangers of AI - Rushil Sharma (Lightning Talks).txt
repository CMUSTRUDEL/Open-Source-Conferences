hi good afternoon everyone yeah so my

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,559
name is Rachelle Sharma I work at reddit

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,170
and today I'd like to speak on the

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,839
dangers of AI which is another side of

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,390
the coin which we usually don't speak or

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:27,180
discuss about so let's see a couple of

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:30,539
points within which AI is leading okay

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,090
privacy how many of you use Amazon Alexa

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,390
or Google home our stuff like that or

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,040
even you know your Google on your mobile

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,070
phones I think most of us do right

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,870
according to a survey and study it has

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,090
been found that Alexa listens to your

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,590
private conversations as well so if you

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,440
are at your home fighting with your wife

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,110
and you are in an argument people at

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,270
Amazon they are listening to it and they

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,370
use that conversation to target you

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,460
specifically to push ads which are

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,610
specific to your mindset most of the

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,680
times you you know sometimes you Google

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,020
a laptop and then you see that laptops

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,270
image on Facebook Twitter Instagram and

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,270
other places this is how the targeted

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,100
machines replacing human beings now this

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
is one of the most debated topics in the

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,509
world of artificial intelligence right

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,060
now let's just take an example of a

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,250
manufacturing unit there are 500

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,640
manufacturers human Labor's in that unit

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,119
and now you in order to increase the

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,070
manufacturer you replace all the 500

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,100
Labor's with machines now you can

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,049
produce more of that atom let's just

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,149
let's just say chocolate right you are

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,390
producing more chocolate in 24 hours

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,770
than before but 500 of the laborers who

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,320
are working there now they are an

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,509
unemployed right they have lost their

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,670
capacity to buy those chocolates right

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:03,210
because they are not running anymore so

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:06,000
how is it helping deep fix how many of

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,369
you know about deep fix yeah right most

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,050
of us know about deep fix let me tell

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,629
you what the what a deep fake is let's

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,849
say you are speaking you have uploaded a

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,760
video of yourself is pee

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:18,650
speaking about something now people who

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,379
work on deep fix they can simply pull

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,659
down your video and edit it so that you

00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,909
are saying something else like people do

00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,829
with political figures or you know

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,290
celebrities they are saying something

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,569
else but then they replace the entire

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,370
video and Audion the general population

00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,930
who are not even aware of this they

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,959
cannot determine the difference between

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,090
them as of now these tools are only

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,099
available to like professional hackers

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,780
or people with a large infrastructure

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,359
but with the increased pace of our

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,310
hardware in our hand who knows in two to

00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:53,959
three years everybody can do it on their

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:59,419
cell phones only autonomous weapons

00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:01,370
right US military is using the

00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:03,379
artificial intelligence to automate

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,919
their weapons to target a specific

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:09,079
region or specific group even a specific

00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,359
race so this can be done as well but

00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:14,329
Google and Microsoft there are a huge

00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:16,489
number of developers who are against

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,329
this but this I don't think that this

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,489
can be stopped

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,069
they will automate the weapons industry

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:27,259
autonomous drones autonomous tanks and

00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:30,019
you know whatnot and last but not least

00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,819
I think maybe we are in the matrix right

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:35,810
we are already being controlled by

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:38,329
machines and who knows because a lot of

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,040
scientists and a lot of AI researchers

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:42,500
which I met in the past couple of years

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,810
they do believe this that yeah this is

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,889
the case or this could be the case in

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,919
the coming years so thank you and good

00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,919
luck

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,900
so any questions or comments yeah

00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:08,220
well see as far as suggestions go I

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,940
don't think that the negative aspects of

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,370
this technology are you know going to

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,830
you know we can completely stop them

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,170
these things like these are inevitable

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,880
because if you are a good and

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,470
responsible person let's just imagine

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,930
that artificial intelligence is just a

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,880
child right now we are training

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,190
artificial intelligence to grow up and

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,690
be a mature good person right but

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,240
somewhere in some part of the world

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,800
there is let's just say a terrorist

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,170
group who also have their hands on

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,360
artificial intelligence now imagine what

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,470
they are training that child to become

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,460
when it grows up so I think this is just

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,460
never table yeah

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,830
we just have to be responsible that's it

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,830
