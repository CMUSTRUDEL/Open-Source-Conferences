actually many people around the table

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,680
have already contributed in different

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,920
ways and it's important to start with to

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,460
say that the whole objective of today as

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,560
well he said it almost that three of us

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,279
who've written it we kind of stand back

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,010
a bit and we want this to be owned by a

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,710
broader group of everybody around the

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,800
table broader group of organizations in

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,349
the spirit of multi-stakeholder

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,920
dimension which will come into that it

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,739
should involve contributions from

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,750
business from civil society from

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,690
government agencies and in some way of

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,579
bringing all those voices into the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,000
report so that it's has it's not a sense

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,390
of a judgement or something like that

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,570
but just a statement of where the

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:09,570
internet is in Thailand in the broadest

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:12,990
sense so the main thing about this is

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,100
that it's not a technical exercise this

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,070
is about human rights it's about

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,750
participation it's about how everybody

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,820
uses the Internet in different ways and

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,400
capturing that sense in all its

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,729
dimensions and that's why it's so

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,079
complicated as you'll see so it's not a

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,820
an economic impact it's not about saying

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,549
this is what the Internet has done to a

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,250
Thai economy it's not about really

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:47,549
telecoms development it's not saying

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:51,090
about the spectrum breakdown for

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:58,350
different providers it's not about

00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:02,759
numbers necessarily though it has all of

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,460
this in there so as you'll see some of

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,350
the indicators are numbers and

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,000
of the colleagues and the national

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,320
statistics office you've already put a

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,260
lot of numbers into this next day but it

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,590
also has questions which are more about

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,190
perceptions which are about how

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,010
different constituencies in Thailand

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,640
feel about how the Internet is moving

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,370
forward so that's also important too

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,070
and many ask some questions about no

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:43,230
institutional structures and laws and so

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:46,290
on and again it's not it's not a sense

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,340
of necessarily of comparative it's also

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:57,300
about and a sense of how Thailand is and

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,770
the object of the exercise ensure that

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,120
what is thinking what is that end

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:07,020
product the end product is not a 56 or

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,090
78 the end product is a story it's a

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,510
narrative about there are different

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,510
dimensions so the dimensions again

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,510
you've seen the previous diagram and

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,410
Masako mentioned this before and the

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:26,010
letters stand then for this so we talked

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,320
about contextual this is a sense of no

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,820
be usual things about where the Thai

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,580
economy is demographic factors of the

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:40,470
time profile of the Thai population as a

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,750
whole and equality so balances of income

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,660
and things like that and then broad

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,880
sense of governance how things work how

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,120
the system works in time and rights

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,940
so naturally UNESCO comes from the UN

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,400
where a set of global rights which are

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,910
come in there and the extent which those

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,520
are being seen put into

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,440
the legislation but also the degree to

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,940
which they're also being observed in

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,670
practice openness so we're in the home

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,230
that saying open-source software but

00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:22,660
it's also about openness and the

00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:25,670
sensitive society being open to change

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,500
which is what's necessary for really

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:32,570
forging ahead in the digital world

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,780
accessibility to all that's the most

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,660
straightforward one obviously the hope

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,060
for everybody is that everybody in

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,580
Thailand everybody in the world really

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,680
will have access to that global

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,920
knowledge base which is the internet

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,800
help with their daily problems health

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,380
and education employment and other

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,140
things that they need to know and then

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,340
multi M for multi stakeholder again

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:05,000
that's really straightforward so who is

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,210
at the table business government civil

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,960
society and all of them have a stake

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:15,380
hole in the internet which is something

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,230
which is in a way owned by everybody and

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,340
then cross-cutting so very key themes

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:24,230
which are important to UNESCO but are

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,350
also important generally across the

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:30,380
world for development moving forward the

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:34,730
status of women and gender generally as

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,560
a issue issue of children and we see

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,930
that coming to the fore more and more as

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,930
people worry about the impact of the

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,600
internet on on young minds sustainable

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,400
development we have from UNESCO is going

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,570
to be the global Stoke sustainable

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,470
development goals and this framework has

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:58,070
to fit into that and all UN work is

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:01,700
pushing forward on those goals trust and

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:04,250
security child I've mentioned the

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,950
situation of children before this whole

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,500
quota whole question of fake news all of

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,380
those issues about security protection

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,840
information protection of other kinds of

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,880
information is involved there then

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,280
lastly the legal and particular the

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,700
ethical problems that the internet poses

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,620
of all of us when we're online and what

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,890
we look at and what we don't look at and

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:33,740
so forth so it's a whole set of issues

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:36,860
there and so again some of the

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,660
principles quickly of the methods of the

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:44,090
way the work puts together but he was

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,000
300 indicators all together and then

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:50,600
move these core elements core indicators

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,470
which are the ones which UNESCO has

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,750
decided are the ones which show the key

00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,919
the basic elements building blocks if

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,690
you like the framework and so those that

00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,480
tend to be ones of the trees is to get

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,160
information on but the other side others

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,770
wiki information which comes in at

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,320
different points so again within that

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,530
framework of the 300 and 100 there's a

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,419
lot of scope for bringing in things

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,270
which characterize the Internet and

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:25,520
Thailand and how it develops and that's

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,860
really awful to Batcopter that breadth

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,610
of what's going on here as well as the

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,370
depth of it within the indicators so

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,220
it's a mix of statistics and narrative

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,740
so obviously from the statistics side

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,910
there is the economic statistics there

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,430
is a very accurate annual survey of

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,820
households and this doesn't know this

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,640
but every two years and things something

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:56,290
so again there is good data from

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,960
Thailand and so we're some really solid

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,030
results to lean on there but then we

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,180
also need these qualitative data round

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,340
perceptions and around the different

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,460
stakeholders understandings of how

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,320
things are going and then for each

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,710
category with then who would be a

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,900
summary which was characterized that

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,820
particular dimension so openness rights

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,310
stakeholders acts

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,470
and it's not aiming to produce an

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,630
international index so it's not like the

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:35,240
Human Development Report or the World

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:38,590
Bank or Internet Development Index of

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:43,820
ITU it's it's designed to produce a

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:46,130
story but it's a story which has to

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,250
reflect your views it's a story which is

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,560
not where the writers and we have to

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,630
we're putting together different point

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,670
of view which obviously at different

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,830
times they're different things but

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,950
broadly speaking has to be a kind of

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,770
summary of what everybody said and the

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,410
purpose of this meeting is to hear your

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:13,610
views to try and bring your views into

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:17,710
the report so we've got the four core

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,900
dimensions rights openness access and

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,240
multi-stakeholder and now we're going to

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,320
kind of I'm going to hand over to art

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,350
who was hope the most of the work into

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,130
the right element and I will deal with

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,380
open access and accessibility and then

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,950
be Ron Ron will deal with the

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,950
multi-stakeholder

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,720
so he sister

00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:52,899
the first right forever which is not

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,600
which I also like Cobra things like

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,790
cultural rights as 12

00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:09,100
it's like mention right so I think like

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:11,380
you already have anyway right so these

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:28,470
are I know the question the main

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:32,199
questions so these are all the main

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:37,899
questions right oh my dad actually like

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:40,930
when when I do the pilot we actually

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:44,050
like it or not not every patient right

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:47,440
but if you see carefully like a smaller

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:52,510
patients right right but I win with me

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,550
overall the pilot study right we sleep

00:10:52,510 --> 00:11:00,010
like we are so far like cooperations

00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:03,190
right obvious like like six main

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,260
questions right which is a leap of a

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,899
verbs right so you're talking about not

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,269
only the law itself right but also like

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:13,990
the institutions right to to enforce a

00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:17,220
law also like or what actually happens

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,139
like exactly is example and then the

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,889
where should be is a of freedom of

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:29,420
expression right see access to

00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:34,370
information and so on and these are the

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,500
so inside right each like let's say like

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,330
big questions right there are like a

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,450
smaller ones right which is actually

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,460
more more than this one right more

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,200
tender things are over or you see in

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,730
East Side but all these are the selected

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,830
coefficient that we used in the pilot

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:58,160
study right example like we'll be

00:11:51,830 --> 00:12:00,290
talking about the film education for

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
example right we're talking about it

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,960
well weight is actually according to

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,670
international law

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,380
equipments and standart right which

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,860
actually tighten or like a lot of

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:13,160
important please also like like part of

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,040
example right so these are equations are

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,500
we talking about like another example

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,960
it's like a happy participation right

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,180
whether the information is actually how

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,070
are they go right and accessible to the

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,830
puppy right so they can actually like

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,610
get participate in the decision made

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:36,460
even although in the policy development

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:42,100
example public consultation process

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:46,010
example and then there are things like

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,320
sometimes not only included in some

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,910
other indicators right but within that

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,240
our dish

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,700
these units of universal indicators

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,250
should also include it as well example

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,830
things about like whether or Internet

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,580
right actually not only a communication

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,650
platform right but it's also a platform

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,230
to enable people to get access to

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:14,060
otherwise right so this is become little

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:17,120
hill here right the rights to get is

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,330
like our services from from from from

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,370
from the public sector right to talk

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:26,240
about employment talking about education

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:29,030
right and then these questions actually

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,970
are concerned about will be talking

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,949
about the freedom of expression of your

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,689
is rate a lot of tablets actually take

00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:40,759
it for granted that you're going to use

00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:44,029
the maybe the national language it's

00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,609
also in Thailand Central Time right but

00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:48,769
what about if you're not late cannot

00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:50,749
really understand how fully right can

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,519
you can still get those really important

00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:55,609
information right so if you don't mind

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:59,359
my diabetes and use all the languages as

00:13:55,609 --> 00:14:01,429
part of your life or just that type of

00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:05,509
information actually available for you

00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:07,459
communities right so so and the thing is

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:11,509
like all these questions is actually

00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:14,149
some of them it's it's look like but you

00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,470
can you can see obviously that it's

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,929
actually not really an isolated

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,759
questions right sometimes it's actually

00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:22,849
going to get a example when we talk

00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,649
about public consultation right if it's

00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:28,549
something called to happen in your

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:30,229
community right and the company receives

00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:33,139
their okay let's have a puppy theory

00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:35,929
right but if the information right it's

00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:38,089
actually not our level in the language

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,339
that we have fully understand right so

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,049
you can cause some problem right so

00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,399
these two patients have been together as

00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,709
well right so when you see these

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,989
patients or try not to think it like in

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,909
isolation press actually or somehow in

00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:52,909
together as well so these are Co

00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:56,149
educators like for the very small and

00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:59,509
sum of all the observations right from

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,759
from the from the pilot studies very and

00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:04,729
exercise everything turned red this is

00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,039
all from the observation of in the

00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:09,949
limited time and limited resources very

00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,499
and at the time we predictability access

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:14,089
to some of the information right so if

00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,409
you think like over from those are

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,619
indicators where you have like more

00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:21,739
inputs right over to the edge rates

00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:23,659
opportunity to do the feedback right so

00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:26,679
absolution from this price hard right

00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:29,930
thing that we we see that like absolve

00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,840
the golden standard right with it

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,120
data protection freedom of expression

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,160
inside that right so that's actually

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,150
quite good right that's like opening

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,300
sentence right

00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:45,100
we actually members of a lot of the

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:50,570
international laws

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,550
bodies right and also like a lot a lot

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,760
of like principles implemented to the

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,190
national law right how they were or when

00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,020
it comes to in the area of example like

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,810
the protection right even though we just

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,090
have the law or just this year right and

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:08,000
it's going to be effective fully or next

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:12,140
year right still there are like quite

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,450
big exceptions right kind of answer if

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,460
example in Section for our personal

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,710
interpretation act right there are

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,740
exceptions for instant national security

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,610
security in foreign state or anti money

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,650
money laundering for we are pretty cool

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,570
right which is actually like in all

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,360
countries there are exceptions like this

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,640
as well but exception are they have

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,980
actually very specific right to the

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,980
activities where but often time

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:43,310
exception or entire yes it's a section

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,230
for the whole industry for the whole

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,560
section right or for the whole agency

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,530
right so this is one of the observation

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,340
that we think that maybe can improve

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,500
example the next boy it's like there's

00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,060
no formal adoption of net neutrality

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,900
right so in terms of competition law

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,540
right it has been seen right obviously

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,280
right to who not only in the internet

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,620
area right actually the following

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,110
industry they're our competition

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:18,380
Commission's not reactive right these

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,209
are perception of what applies to it in

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,209
the area of Internet industry as well

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,060
right so in the area of control average

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,520
they actually don't know not not really

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:33,380
like fully like I can take this concept

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,940
right ah next it's the it's like a long

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,620
time when it comes to consumer rights

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,100
right Oh

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,809
is between the consumer and

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,570
multinational platforms right which is

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:47,770
how all time to distinction right that's

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:52,010
how that's lack of effective enforcement

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,050
so that's one more thing and then our

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,460
next two points where I just go by it

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:00,530
together it's related to the law that

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,480
has been conceived right as a

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,520
restriction or to the freedom of

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,680
explanation right many times right it's

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,000
come under the name like it's peach or

00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,280
fake names right

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,460
but I'll bend over the law actually cut

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:18,790
enforce implemented it has used in a

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:22,460
different way right so example like

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:25,300
there's the cases that like maybe the

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,900
interchange itself right it's actually

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:33,920
maybe have represent in Korea right but

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:37,550
there's no intention to too hard copy

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,990
example but maybe the government centers

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,090
like this information right it's

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,450
actually the attack to the government so

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:47,179
the label is as famous right and you saw

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,110
lost like a Google project example or

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:54,020
deformation law under the Penal Code to

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:59,809
sue those people big space

00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:01,760
oh the thing right and when it comes to

00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,350
freedom of expression all I right it's

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,830
also connected to other issues like

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:10,309
privacy as obedient Association as well

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,800
and the last part is about the public

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:16,550
participation right actually Thailand is

00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,710
around a little high and also improving

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,880
right or two years when it comes to the

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,370
public government data right anyway

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,550
there's a lot of KSS right when the

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:30,260
example would be government with the

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,210
company change with the government eh

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,350
way from from like population to another

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:39,320
election it had to change to the baby

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,630
side of the website right so all the

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,170
links or the URL or web address change

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:47,450
right and people no longer be able to

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:50,090
get access to information so basically

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,980
in virgin sorry is there somewhere in

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,280
the website but the link that you have

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,840
it's known of the valley right because

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,060
there's no concept of like dominantly or

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,830
something like that right the open keep

00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,550
changing the design of the website is

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,230
about or sometimes before it's some

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:11,500
knowledge to actually its ownership

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:17,090
video example but it comes to the court

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:21,020
cases of order right there's no single

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:23,570
toilet that you can actually go to if

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,140
there's like 20 courts right I mean

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:29,929
strictly for consumer rights of consumer

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,030
protection call court or like not

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,440
Bangkok's how I often say that right in

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,010
your mind like that you have to go

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,870
through every court right so at first

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,000
you actually have to know first thing is

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,290
here actually belongs to these part of

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,730
that core right

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,620
and then you can go to search and

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,360
sometimes you can actually use the

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,980
keyword research you actually have to

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,150
know the specific document number right

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,120
so yes

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:58,610
the document is available or not but

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,810
it's not that accessible right it's not

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:04,550
first of all time right so so the

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,850
observation is games like let me do that

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:10,130
it's it's our level yes but maybe not

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,730
always or sometimes a little bit

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,730
difficult

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,269
[Music]

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:29,269
so the next time I mention is is

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:33,820
openness so as I said this is not just

00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:37,340
open source software but it's open

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,380
society as a whole and you can begin to

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,120
see a lot of the indicators kind of

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,470
cross across the different categories

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:50,269
and the letters here you find pretty

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:53,320
much to say under each category so law

00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:58,580
we just saw in the rights law and legal

00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:03,529
policy be open standards so again

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:08,320
there's standards for open access to a

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:11,570
variety of matters standards for open

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,590
Internet and technical standards open

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,139
market so that the market for in the

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:22,580
internet internet baby e-commerce and so

00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:26,200
on open content open source but also

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,909
open data and then lastly open data and

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,830
government in terms of that they could

00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:36,559
be made public and again I think it's

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,510
important to stress here that it's this

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,179
balance that is struck here

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,940
none of these indicators for completely

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,059
one side or completely the other and

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,039
there are reasons why you know just to

00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,620
take the last one out of the Hat for

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,039
open data but there's some data that

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,559
government would want to withhold it is

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,429
importantly it may in fact in infringe

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,250
personal data anyway many government

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:07,010
offices whole personal data and they

00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,230
cannot release it because of that

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,600
personal infringement but there's a

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,210
balance here to be instructor some data

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,510
can be released some data cut some

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,510
things the restrictions we all know that

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,909
fake news needs some kind of control now

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,659
what kind of control and how does that

00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:28,460
balance work so that you can keep that

00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:34,330
open access to the Internet to

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:37,610
be able to read whatever you want again

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,910
this is a problem we have no 300

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:44,270
indicators or 100 indicators even to

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:47,810
present in half an hour now a very short

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:50,840
time it's so it's difficult to really go

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:54,290
down into the details but these are the

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:58,940
core indicators is maybe a couple of

00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:02,930
things on the way through well there is

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,270
so graph some amount of telecoms data we

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,670
want to look we've been having to didn't

00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,890
report some sense of market shares

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,510
between different providers but there is

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,580
a balance here between different

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:20,680
providers a choice to people and bad

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,680
sense of an open market again is there

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:28,850
open education resources open data legal

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,790
frameworks availability of public data

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:37,730
and so really what we're doing at this

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,560
point in this session we're just picking

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,140
out those core indicators just to give

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,740
you an idea and we pick out some simple

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,500
quick conclusions but all this is to be

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,470
developed and this is where if you see

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,570
things that you see all that things need

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,490
to be new arms or things which are

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,560
missing which are important things to

00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,460
get in this is again what we need to

00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,700
hear from you

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,490
so generally especially for me as an

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,300
outsider I see that the Thai economy is

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:11,030
very open very entrepreneurial those

00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,920
small businesses start everywhere and

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,180
you see all the way down the street when

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:20,720
you walk down that anywhere in Bangkok

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:22,100
now and people we've talked to and

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,050
people look at things with their own

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:28,670
resources that I've seen say there are

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:30,830
support the startup and but clearly this

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,280
needs to take your Albany's be more

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:36,530
support the startup and startup is one

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,020
thing sustainability into the future I

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,460
have a sense maybe

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,910
lifetime for business the average

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,820
startup business is not long here and

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,430
then we have to consider all the time

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,380
there's been talking about online

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:54,860
activity right and when we notice that

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:59,180
only a quarter of small business with 10

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:02,840
employees are online that actually is

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:06,860
something that needs to be addressed as

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,290
it were and clearly we know lots of

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,500
reasons why lack of resources like the

00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,030
skills lack of knowledge but still the

00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,310
Internet is the source for a lot of

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,380
those good ideas business developments

00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,600
the source of marketing to source for

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,510
all sorts of things a lot of that

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:32,120
business survival rate could probably

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:35,380
improve significantly if again I don't

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,200
want to dwell on this too long but what

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,630
we've done on this one thing that others

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,330
seem to be saying is that in the future

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,880
next few years there are expected

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:51,260
opportunities in health and education

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,900
for internet businesses I mean clearly

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:57,080
there is an eHealth strategy was strong

00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:01,700
strategies here which probably don't

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:04,040
exist again in many other countries so

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:09,560
again this is a positive point but also

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:15,560
a point where things may need to move

00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:20,060
forward in the future again two sides to

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:22,940
this coin to so open data so there are a

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:26,780
number of from the international side

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,600
initiatives to push and to support the

00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:33,140
idea that countries should put more

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:36,380
public data and other kinds of data on

00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,680
the web for easy access

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,600
so education resources clearly teachers

00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,920
are always looking at the new learning

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,610
materials that they can use in the

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:50,300
classroom even people citizens generally

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:52,790
are looking for courses for information

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,500
they can use to improve their knowledge

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:59,390
or solve problems that they particularly

00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:02,750
have and there is a major site site for

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:07,330
open education resources in Thailand set

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:12,740
up by the government equally well the

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:16,700
DGD a DGA has set up as well a major

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,100
site for public information and again

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,550
you can see it has a huge range of data

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,280
from many agencies so again both of

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:29,080
these really show that Thailand has very

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:32,420
much taken on board the idea of data

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,030
however as a heart was really saying

00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:38,090
some of these sites can be difficult to

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:42,230
use and you certainly ask yourself with

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:45,830
some of these major quantities of data

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:48,590
how easy as if the users to find what

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:53,120
they want and when I've looked at the

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:55,940
site and even though I don't know Thai I

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,760
can see that I can find categories I can

00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,380
find particular elements but then a

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,150
particular document they had to really

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,110
look right through it and find out

00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:08,480
exactly what it's about and whether it

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,720
could help me or not and I can't really

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,900
go take a long time going through

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,990
documents another point though is this

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,780
is the survey page from Vienna so this

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,240
is actually one of the major uses that

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,700
people make them you internet so one of

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,500
the biggest things that both businesses

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,660
and individuals say they use the

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,190
internet for is accessing government

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,870
information so again we have a kind of

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,270
double sided thing here on the one hand

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,490
there is a lot of danger out there that

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,410
government has put online and a lot of

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,080
people who are using it but these

00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:48,290
sickness thing is still relatively low

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,300
and so there's still a lot of work that

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:53,240
could be done to improve the usability

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,100
of the sites and that uses there's a lot

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,100
of space for more users to be involved

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,640
here which we're helping obviously in in

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,350
the number

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,350
different ways of taking things forward

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:10,150
generally speaking although we could say

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,040
that there are a limited number of

00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,929
internet service providers or telecom

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,910
companies that's the same in most

00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:19,120
countries and it's clear this kind of

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:24,890
fierce competition with the market share

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:27,559
and one particularly strikes one is that

00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:30,530
the devices internet connections are

00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,220
relatively cheap I think if you look at

00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:36,320
the International affordability index

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:39,290
Thailand is in the top ten in cheapest

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,360
in the world in terms of country in

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,850
terms of accessing the Internet in that

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,760
sense so that's again it's a very good

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,429
sign there's an open commercial market

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,460
there is a sensitivity it's really cheap

00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:59,990
easy people to government to get access

00:30:52,460 --> 00:31:02,059
and competition I mean I got that last

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,950
point damper open source software I'm

00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:06,440
going to go over it but this is an open

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:17,000
software conference so find people to

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:19,250
talk about so conclusions so there's

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,080
still in openness there's a lot of

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:26,450
positives here there's success there's a

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,660
really strong commercial market really

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:32,210
strong competitive environment there's a

00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:35,500
lot of open data which the government's

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:37,640
has put forward but there's need for

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,650
continuing development there's need the

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,200
continuing support for small companies

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,000
and there's need for continuing

00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,010
development of the government sites and

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,530
more government information to be out

00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:55,669
there to help people move forward in

00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:57,169
this area so that's openness so this is

00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:00,380
the easiest one to deal with

00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:02,299
accessibility to all thanks to very good

00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,120
data from the National Statistics Office

00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,510
I mean it's a simple point here really I

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,820
mean it will get more complicated but

00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,890
basically what we're trying to achieve

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,610
here obvious is that everybody in

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,120
Thailand is on the internet and using it

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:24,000
for to improve their lives in all sorts

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:27,730
of different ways and going backwards

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,820
there we go so again you can see the

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:33,750
same Cataclysm now before legal

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:37,990
framework rights that people have access

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:41,050
connectivity can they connect the

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:44,530
provide from the provision sense the

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:47,950
coverage of wireless signals around the

00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:50,550
country which is obviously very good the

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,920
level of traffic on the Internet is the

00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:57,640
technical bandwidth enough to take that

00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,250
traffic affordability which I've already

00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,410
talked about again these crossovers go

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,900
across the categories equitable access

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,510
the key kind of element here I have same

00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,830
global content and language and art

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:12,160
talked a little bit about language

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:14,770
earlier and then skills and competences

00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,050
yes things may be cheap and you can cut

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,360
your phone you press the button but you

00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:33,070
do have the skills to really find what

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:34,840
you're looking for so again I probably

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,700
have the most pretty much in what I've

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,590
just said that you can see how those

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,770
categories boiled down to a number of

00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,530
specific questions so these are the ones

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:47,200
that are really where we kind of the

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:51,670
framework pushes us to write something a

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,430
paragraph on each one of these ICT

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,220
skills media literacy there's some

00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,320
information but it's limited and it's

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:06,930
difficult to really put your finger on

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:10,240
exactly the level of skills language is

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:12,730
generally this is not a huge problem in

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,329
Thailand but there are significant

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:21,609
can they access what they need to

00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:27,159
improve their lives number of technical

00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:33,040
indicators around provision broadband

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:36,549
coverage so progressive universal access

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,309
it's a nice easy one some questions here

00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:43,059
the standard indicator is about have you

00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:46,210
ever used internet so well I guess I

00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:47,950
used it ten years ago but now I'm in my

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:51,520
little village at home it's a bit more

00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:55,109
difficult so the question is around that

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,290
aging population I'll get back to you

00:34:55,109 --> 00:35:02,079
okay right to adhere in time so this is

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:05,680
the population projection by age group

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,520
and as we all know Thailand has a very

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:18,369
rapidly aging population and if you look

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:22,329
at it this is then the yet 60 plus + 50

00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:25,390
plus and you can see that this is by by

00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:27,970
next year in theory at least this is

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,790
like 30 percent of the population so a

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:34,960
third of the population are over the age

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:40,380
of 50 it's huge and yet look at the

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:45,520
internet users on this side only some

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:48,640
10% of that group or 10% things that

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,040
users come from back through so it's

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,309
very clear in terms of the population

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,569
this is the area which needs most work

00:35:54,309 --> 00:36:00,339
and when - in the old days when I worked

00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:02,950
the UNESCO we used to deal with literacy

00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:06,040
like this and he always used to be all

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:10,540
the people who wear the older school

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,280
system who were less literate but the

00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,829
boys he said well when the school system

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,049
moves forward this group will disappear

00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:18,970
I don't think this is going to be the

00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:21,400
case here because we all know the

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,920
internet moves forward forward really

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,950
fast I mean I'm having problems already

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,079
with the Internet of Things when I'm 10

00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:33,040
years old and I got my walking stick and

00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,930
so on I'm going to be the worst date so

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,020
this problem is not going to go away

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:42,230
except through actually addressing that

00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,230
[Music]

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:57,630
so to put that in a different

00:36:53,290 --> 00:37:00,849
perspective this is simply taking the

00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:04,990
percentage of the population of 6 which

00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:07,780
is from the survey via NSF survey

00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:10,390
household use and just plotting madtown

00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,089
as a percentage in tech users as a

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:16,349
percentage of population group and you

00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:19,660
can see immediately it's not unexpected

00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:21,520
so the red areas are the hot areas if

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,210
you like where Internet usage is

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,569
incredibly high and as you get bluer you

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:31,240
get colder and it's the more remote

00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:33,970
areas where Internet usage is very low

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,250
and surprise surprise

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,190
it's mostly the rural areas more remote

00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:42,450
areas and that is the place of course

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:45,250
where a lot of the older fifties are

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,740
because at least in the rural population

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:51,549
their kids have all come to Bangkok for

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:54,220
top jobs in the city and they all have

00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:59,530
their smartphones but back over the

00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:02,859
village there are quite isolated so it's

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:07,119
clear again these two figures might fit

00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:09,700
together very well but it's younger

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,960
people yes there's a question of skills

00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,589
in the education system

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,480
we all know you had the smartphone to a

00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:18,180
ten-year-old and only takes 2 hours and

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,490
may use it better than you do

00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:25,319
but the older people they don't know

00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,319
which button to press before

00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:32,349
so there's some question here so there

00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:36,249
are three issues about language opera is

00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:39,549
also about disability now if I'm blind

00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:42,640
and I have a smartphone I have to rely

00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:46,029
on Siri or a lexer or when talking to

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,249
the phone apps to make it work but the

00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:50,589
phone can be a way for somebody who is

00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:55,150
disabled to have access to all that they

00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:57,880
need in services which reduced mobility

00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,949
can stop them having access to the

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,680
Internet can be a huge help the

00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:04,809
disability Sable people so some

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,289
excluding people grew up after the

00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:11,619
population they're simply the people

00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:14,259
who've been left behind in a way by the

00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:17,829
huge progress that Thailand has made in

00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:19,839
terms of Internet activity and if you

00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:22,209
look at this coming from the National

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,099
Statistics Office again affordability is

00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:27,640
not an issue you can see that from the

00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:29,229
prices itself it's how to use it whether

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,749
the national statistics office survey

00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:33,489
the biggest barrier is always but we

00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:35,769
can't see the point in using the

00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:38,019
Internet the bad answer is coming from

00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:39,880
people who don't have the skills to

00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,430
really use it and don't have the

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,329
education not the education training to

00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:48,039
know what to do but their successes and

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,529
the government is very aware of this and

00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:54,279
we have the Burnett Patriot problem

00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:57,160
which has gone over to remember to four

00:39:54,279 --> 00:40:00,099
thousand villages a couple of years ago

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,119
and that is the kind of program that has

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:07,289
to go on I think so it's if you like

00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,289
keep on doing good work

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:27,400
there we go now and there is a time when

00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:30,890
I was working like this last year to

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,099
researchers we only have a little more

00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:42,470
than a month to do research to compile

00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:44,570
everything so much of the result so your

00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:48,589
participation your input today would be

00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:51,020
highly crucial in any case as we agree

00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:53,900
that the Roma framework is affordable

00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,119
and this provides a overarching scheme

00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,520
moving together a range of factors that

00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:02,359
shape internet developments as universal

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:04,660
resource but when we're giving this has

00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:08,750
to do last year

00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:12,820
we looking at not only the feasibility

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:17,330
of the indicators but also applicability

00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:19,220
in national context in China so as far

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:24,500
as not a stakeholder participation to

00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:29,119
discern when when we look at the

00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:33,440
question semantically to report the

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:36,050
meanings we could provide insight is

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,000
their policy and legal framework for in

00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,920
2012 and china and this course that the

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,700
National ICT must have been created in

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,520
2002 which is in effect from 2001

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,430
2010 and then continuing to attack

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:55,750
Thailand ICT policy framework we was in

00:41:49,430 --> 00:42:02,359
effect from 2011 to 2020 and followed by

00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:04,010
this so after the coup in 2014 the

00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:06,650
government that was installed by the qu

00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:10,069
al introduces so-called 20 is 40 G

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,619
National Department plan but we became

00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:16,280
unclear as far as overall commitment and

00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:20,540
some concern but we saw the neighbors

00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:24,109
around this village back to the project

00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:27,890
but as far as multi stakeholder

00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:32,660
participation and comfortability that is

00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:34,130
not quite person in any case much of the

00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,910
indicators and that this topic I

00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:40,880
probably won't be going one by one but

00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:43,069
of the speed giving you a fair

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,839
assessment of what we found and some

00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:49,970
interesting findings mark the indicators

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,880
under this topic as about extent and

00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,549
evidence of participation by different

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,079
stakeholder groups in contemporary

00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:59,690
policymaking and legislative processes

00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:02,299
and we found that while there are

00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,970
constitutional provision and sectoral

00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:08,030
law that requires public hearings and

00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:10,270
this is the larger framework of public

00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:14,690
participation not just our internet

00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:17,500
development there are constitutional

00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:20,030
provision that required the hearing or

00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,520
consultation with prevalence of relevant

00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:26,359
state or the route prior to a passage of

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,100
law or regulation the frequent exists

00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:32,520
but in terms of the

00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,590
the ways these hearings or consultations

00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,900
are carried out is quite questionable

00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:40,760
and not to mention the valley would

00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:46,530
impact the law and policy making process

00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:48,600
well and one normal thing is whether the

00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:51,180
current constitution the 2016

00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,890
Constitution it allows stakeholder

00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,830
consultation and I mentioned this

00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:58,440
because in one of the indicator

00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:01,230
presented by the idea they asked about

00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,320
whether there is a policy or legal

00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:08,070
arrangement for online consultation so

00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,170
which means as far as the idea of units

00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:15,990
were in Hawaii conceptualizations

00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:17,970
concern the Internet is is he some is

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,390
view as a platform for public

00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,490
participation but I think I don't really

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:25,670
think that the Thai government or the

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,830
type of the you know obviously in embody

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,230
really view that as a two-way

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,690
communication platform they look at it

00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,250
more as a public relationship

00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:39,000
information dissemination platform so

00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:42,510
the to the conceptualization don't quite

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,630
cracked there is a basement so in any

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:48,900
case there is this so-called law

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:54,030
Amendment doctrine or activate website

00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:57,120
which is which which which is by default

00:44:54,030 --> 00:45:03,830
is an online consultation channel for

00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:06,750
anybody who wants to raise questions or

00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:12,330
participate in any kind of input about

00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:15,990
Lord Allah not an immense but we also be

00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:18,750
prepared for them whether it is website

00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:22,590
from your email or convention public

00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,300
hearings there is still question of

00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:27,570
inadequacy

00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,420
participation at one point is the

00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:40,230
participation considered a degree is one

00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:40,980
or two adequate there is no that is not

00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,050
me Bella

00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,360
there's no right if you pipeline has to

00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:48,240
if there's one and two is that consider

00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:52,560
I'm adequate when there is a platform

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,660
but when would it be that effective and

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,230
another thing it's a technical career

00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:00,680
and the error that a number of

00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:04,740
complaints of technical errors and

00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:17,610
barriers people get may be similar to

00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:20,550
this people on the website and and

00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:24,720
support and also the processing of input

00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:27,000
data responsible Authority because we

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,120
know it's not really clear a lot of

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,780
people that we talk to from civil

00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:36,210
society said that they have entered some

00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:39,360
information but they never there was

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:42,300
never an empirical evidence that those

00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,930
input were really taken into account or

00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,960
taken for the background by the

00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:52,020
authority in charge anyway also the the

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,270
indicator also discusses quite

00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:57,450
extensively about the local presence of

00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:59,700
Internet governance mechanism mechanism

00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,940
as well as participation of local

00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,160
stakeholders in Internet Governance at

00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:08,550
regional and international levels

00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,550
I think these indicators are very well

00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:15,230
thought out and but from the point of

00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:19,710
view of a small country like I am which

00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:22,420
figure is really minimally at such

00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:26,820
regional international forums

00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:29,290
I think that the in here is me me from

00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,840
from the point of view of the important

00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:34,840
moments they may be a bit too broad base

00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,850
and to oblivious to specific needs and

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:44,340
different positions of developing

00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:49,450
countries and there are also some

00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:52,540
indicators in this in this section on

00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,940
multi-step organism that mentioned

00:47:52,540 --> 00:48:00,010
specifically about Ikea or Internet

00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:02,320
companies firms from some of the point

00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,570
of views of the informants they feel

00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,120
that coming from a small country like

00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:13,870
Thailand and AIGFP mainly a dialogue

00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:16,330
forum rather than policymaking forum it

00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:19,030
doesn't get type integer participation

00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:25,030
they don't really see they don't really

00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:31,690
see the merits of investing in in going

00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:33,820
and so forth because IGFs and will have

00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:36,970
a formal mechanism for input

00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:40,090
particularly for on civil society into

00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:43,290
any policies and documents - and also

00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:45,850
there was also a pie for idea which was

00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:47,230
existing a number of indicators and in

00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:50,680
this category

00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:54,510
it was also question raised about the

00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,980
positing of iconic as an example of

00:48:54,510 --> 00:49:00,580
multi-stakeholder forum for different

00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,980
governance while the structure of ICANN

00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,370
may allow for participation in

00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,910
government levels apart from the GAC

00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:12,730
with them which is but if you look at a

00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:16,740
country specific situation there are

00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:19,480
several factors that may influence

00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,880
participation whether it be financial

00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:26,430
will cause a lot to go to

00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:30,190
to participate regularly linguistically

00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:32,050
political control and these are factors

00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:38,500
that I don't think have sufficiently

00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:40,090
recompense indicators in the Chinese few

00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,970
of our performance feel that these

00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:46,300
factors have dissipated their fruitful

00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:49,090
participation that I can so instead of

00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,220
praising participation as I can even in

00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,410
in error or something that is taken for

00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,850
granted and in my new service to

00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:59,710
underprivileged countries such as ours

00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,920
and then in this world seem of the

00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:04,750
governance to directly address

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,090
limitations not suppose that given their

00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:12,810
being a private means the public safe

00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:12,810
for tourism located wrong from the fix I

00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:37,950
only have anticipating idea the last

00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:39,580
time that we brought a PR idea was it

00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:42,790
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:46,360
very few very few of government

00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:49,240
organizations paid any attention it was

00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:52,990
right here Bangkok in a very few and

00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,360
actually the PTC was was co-host and

00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:58,240
they were very generous with them with

00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,270
the sponsorship but I think I would

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,490
install one who regularly participated

00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,260
that was beliefs about buckles and

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:21,230
nobody else would

00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:24,470
recession so lastly we have something

00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:28,010
quickly about cross-cutting issues so

00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,900
quite difficult to get through so I'm

00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:36,080
going to move through quite quickly I

00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:41,510
think so these are the four issues which

00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:43,490
go across the categories and gender

00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:47,780
children sustainable development trust

00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:50,870
and security I'm going to concentrate

00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:53,290
more on the first three and there's some

00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,430
but many of the issues have already

00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:59,120
covered because they're cross-cutting

00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:05,120
they come across and or Denis mentioned

00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:10,360
under the other categories so gender

00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:13,820
covers women's empowerment areas

00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:16,550
particularly for women or by sex in

00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,990
terms of addressing accessing the

00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:25,910
Internet and obviously legal framework

00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:28,280
clicking harassment children internet

00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:33,440
amongst children barriers it's the same

00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:37,550
same kinds of things right the child and

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:41,480
sustainable development policy for a

00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:43,820
long term high speed development the SME

00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,130
usage and again and talk about that a

00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:51,440
little bit already about sustainability

00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:57,740
there and trust and security cyber

00:52:51,440 --> 00:53:02,720
security emergency responses thinkin and

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:04,880
ethics since that risks again can see

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,800
vulnerable groups talked about a little

00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,029
bit already

00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,189
so gender so

00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:17,339
generally speaking that data suggests

00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:20,400
that women men generally equal access

00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:24,029
equal roles and employment in Thailand

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:27,749
but qualitative data kind of suggests

00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:30,059
that is kind of masking still a society

00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:34,919
in which they are maybe do face

00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:38,279
particular problem the children the

00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:40,319
statistic suggests that familiarity with

00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:43,589
the internet starts as young as six to

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,769
ten years old all that implies we talked

00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:49,679
about problems we all those errands talk

00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:53,039
think about questions about whether our

00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:55,949
children should have access and when the

00:53:53,039 --> 00:54:00,179
time occasion curriculum explicitly

00:53:55,949 --> 00:54:02,549
talks about ICT skills and there are

00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:05,159
indeed some initiatives towards my own

00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:07,019
question about child protection online I

00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:11,069
was hearing about some of those

00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:14,549
yesterday but then there's still a

00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:17,909
question about how to what extent sure

00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:20,369
to really do get that sense of training

00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:24,890
in the use of the internet which is

00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:24,890
allows them to have use it responsibly

00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:32,400
sustainable development generally

00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:34,289
institutions here I know there's been

00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,390
several changes of government but

00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:39,989
generally the institution structures

00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:42,719
here have been lasting not being there

00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:49,109
for some time and are continuing to

00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:52,380
develop new policies in this area usage

00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:55,439
statistics are high people access online

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,320
information I didn't mention the online

00:54:55,439 --> 00:55:00,050
bank

00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,870
what's going to before for me this is

00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:05,270
like Thailand is one of the most

00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:09,350
advanced countries in the world in this

00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:11,300
sense if I took a QR code into my shop

00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:13,610
in Canada they wouldn't even understand

00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:17,270
what it was and they'd be asking for my

00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:20,180
credit card whole time this is something

00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:23,300
where Thailand is really leading the

00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:28,150
world in terms of developing financial

00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:31,360
models for allowing people to pay for

00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:35,390
anything through online facilities

00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:38,840
public facilities they're inspecting

00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:41,360
schools libraries clinics oh as in many

00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,730
countries now people are saying well do

00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:47,330
we need those because increasingly

00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:49,990
everybody has a mobile phone and they

00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:53,480
just access the data wherever they are

00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:55,580
so there's questions there because we've

00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,340
seen in rural areas there are major

00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:01,850
barriers and limits the name will be a

00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,860
place for those still SME activity again

00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:12,610
we've talked about that very

00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:12,610
entrepreneurial society maybe moving on

00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:23,020
so again some sense as to where things

00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:26,480
are here so there is questions of

00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:29,990
engagements in civil society both in

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,920
terms of security and Trust very issues

00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:39,380
around security for children and other

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:43,310
people there have been major have been

00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:45,560
issues with legal sanctions that have

00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:59,180
been introduced in the last year's but

00:56:45,560 --> 00:57:02,240
maybe overall again I want to pick up on

00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:05,600
their own drawings points as well this

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,000
is not just about the kind of monolithic

00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,610
set of 300 indicators

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,270
we also want to know how these

00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:18,020
indicators can reflect the internet

00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:19,820
compiler so it's not just about we want

00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,800
you to fill out all these UNESCO

00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,410
indicators that the member will be this

00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:28,850
is what UNESCO thinks this is a response

00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:32,060
to UNESCO as well about telling UNESCO

00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:33,850
what internet looks like in Thailand and

00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:37,550
I think there's plenty of capacity

00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:39,560
across this massive indicator suite for

00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:43,240
picking out those subtleties like I say

00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:49,070
advance financial information yeah the

00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:56,060
cheapness of which gives Thailand major

00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:58,820
advantages at the global level so really

00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:03,200
from now onwards and queuing it's over

00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:05,510
for you these colors where this works

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,420
and where it doesn't and what's missing

00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:10,780
where the gaps are and what changes

00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,780
should be made

00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:19,190
it's it's a huge set of indicators we

00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:22,100
rush through it very quickly and if

00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:24,560
there's anything that you didn't see up

00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,540
there that you would think should be up

00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:29,150
there in terms of the topic or something

00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:32,980
it may be hidden in the indicators

00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:35,840
somewhere that you didn't see but all

00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:39,020
the maybe things that went by too fast

00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:42,290
and you didn't quite capture or

00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:44,030
understand what the intention was or

00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:46,820
what were words or what the indicator

00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:50,800
meant so initially of any questions

00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:54,170
about exactly what the indicators are

00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:57,560
why they're there the questions about

00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:59,450
the suite itself or things that you

00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,440
think should be there that work or

00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,440
misunderstandings

00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:12,329
thank you so much for a very visitations

00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:15,010
that the representative of that side

00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:18,970
especially need some aggravation of the

00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:23,380
last slide about the making together of

00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:25,750
the multi-stakeholders where I have

00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,510
questioned under the right side like of

00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:30,730
the national security was like the

00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:33,730
rights protections how do you find the

00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:37,089
benchmark between I don't like from the

00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:39,460
state side and publicity societies I'd

00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:42,670
be open and seen as a different whole

00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:45,160
different side sending like side of you

00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:49,839
but I think this I kind of like her for

00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:53,549
that he can come to like finding was a

00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:57,990
 well what can we have the same

00:59:53,549 --> 01:00:00,609
like perspective on how to balance a

00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:03,790
comment on like say in these different

01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:05,829
spaces between these regions they always

01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:09,220
say like we need to protect national

01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:12,819
security so some of the rights that

01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:15,430
could be exact when I've already

01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:20,349
mentioned under the personal data

01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:21,220
provisions section for right that that

01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:25,089
could be lived

01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:27,010
it's to protect national security so I

01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:29,500
know what what's the part of the other

01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:32,619
guess for how do you define national

01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:35,430
security and you know either they have

01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:38,910
like hierarchy between like to take

01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:44,400
conservative White's or to give like the

01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:44,400
dangers of international security again

01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:55,800
yeah maybe if this puts up my questions

01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:55,800
as well we pick two or three out there

01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:09,070
otherwise start with I mean this is

01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:13,930
obviously is a big kind of question here

01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:17,050
I think that there are firstly there are

01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:20,200
some benchmarks so that very soon

01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:23,260
I'm suppose which we adopted in the UN

01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:26,980
and adopted therefore by all countries

01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:29,560
which are written down about the kind of

01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:34,300
things that have countries say they will

01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:36,940
do and so there's a sense in which it's

01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:42,910
clear in that sense what what countries

01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:44,950
have said be able to doper also also on

01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:47,500
the other side but also practical issues

01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:50,710
which means there are things which are

01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:53,110
covered by national security right way

01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:55,300
across the board in every country has

01:01:53,110 --> 01:02:01,800
its sense of national security and

01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:05,470
rightly so it has to maintain its

01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:11,350
society has to maintain its legal

01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:14,380
position and things like that so I think

01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:16,900
it's finding that balance and recently

01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:19,780
in all countries this balances has

01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,580
changed as well I mean one of the issues

01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:24,610
where exchange has being this issue

01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:26,740
around that news for example and as

01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:28,660
misako says they users have had a

01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,820
different complexion in different

01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:33,550
countries and again that balance has to

01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:36,700
be struck and many countries have not

01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:39,430
found that balance yet because it's it's

01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:42,490
such a new issue has to be fitted into

01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:45,460
law it has to be and they have to find

01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:50,980
the balance that's right for them so I

01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:54,790
think again in this sense my sense would

01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:58,619
be that the indicators should express

01:02:54,790 --> 01:03:02,809
the sense of there are two sides

01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:06,210
and that Thailand is is working its way

01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:10,229
towards a common understanding and what

01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:12,150
that balance should be and as I say no

01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:25,380
country has really found that balance

01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:28,950
yet I was expecting someone from OHCHR

01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:33,299
to be there because she is she's a legal

01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:35,400
expert by I know but there is an

01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:38,039
importance to thank you from the human

01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,950
right perspective and when he starts to

01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:43,619
the right to freedom of expression and

01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:47,719
the right artists new creations and the

01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:50,369
balance between cyber security safety

01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:54,180
from the human right expected there is a

01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:57,599
number of instrument which was enacted

01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:58,259
by I guess you know more my Council of

01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,390
Europe

01:03:58,259 --> 01:04:03,059
which takes us when access my

01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:07,890
information reversed on human rights

01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:10,380
issues it should be given priority it

01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:13,710
should not be high till based on

01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:16,289
national security issues so there is

01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:19,049
already some kind of a little regional

01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:23,009
or international standards as out there

01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:24,660
and which clearly set up the standards

01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:27,420
in terms of access to information

01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:30,569
freedom of people freedom of information

01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:33,059
which says that when they are some human

01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:35,549
right issue just be different priority

01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:38,249
as compared to the national security and

01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:41,940
then again the advantages of these

01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:44,999
miniscule internet universality in the

01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:48,450
framework is an Amazon cutting result

01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:50,609
like right you can highlight you know

01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:55,259
some of the challenges that the country

01:04:50,609 --> 01:04:58,160
have in terms of human rights or even

01:04:55,259 --> 01:05:04,910
freedom expressions but under all

01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:08,930
categories like cross any issues or or

01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:13,720
contextual yes make native cross-cutting

01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:16,910
later you can also highlight the

01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:20,000
security and the need to protect women

01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:23,660
trying safety and this kind of thing so

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,540
it doesn't end - because as I mentioned

01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:30,800
it's really a difficult virus and we are

01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:35,660
still looking for for this violent

01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:38,930
little in many countries again the

01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:44,210
indicators provide us information how

01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:46,880
our country is handing mr. right uh if

01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:48,770
we can actually talking like cases that

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,980
actually already happen right and and

01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:54,740
and actually like had some roots into

01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:57,500
the actual national laws that sometime

01:05:54,740 --> 01:06:02,110
may go along with it inertia I'll stand

01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:05,270
and try to extend the sometimes the

01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:06,860
interpretation to make it more fits into

01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:10,210
the currency to agent right because they

01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:13,610
actually are for example those bio

01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:16,820
Universal Declaration of Human Rights

01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:18,440
right or even those the ICCPR that are

01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,780
concerned about those civil rights and

01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,780
political rights right or has been

01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:26,480
ratified like quite some time go alright

01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,430
that at the time there's no such thing

01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,440
like internet yet right

01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:32,840
so I think it's very important that when

01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,730
we all read those like or Universal

01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,610
Declaration of Human Rights or Isis BR

01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:40,490
or like although decoration for examples

01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:42,320
like economic and cultural rights are it

01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:44,960
should not be read or in itself private

01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:47,780
it should be all read together with the

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,120
more updated basically of those like

01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:52,790
comments from the Special Rapporteur all

01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:55,930
right to make it like more relevant to

01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:59,360
the current situations and I think like

01:06:55,930 --> 01:07:03,110
so so so in a sense right or we can say

01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:04,250
those ICCPR or Universal Declaration of

01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:07,100
Human Rights it's more or less like

01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:08,860
Constitution right which okay this is a

01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:11,300
principle that all the Member States

01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:15,110
like to call it right but of course

01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:18,680
there are different situations or that

01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:20,600
happens in in different countries and

01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,380
whatsoever which is like I think that's

01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,420
that's a reason why we have the National

01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,680
right but anyway those natural laws

01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:31,050
needs amendment anyway right open the

01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,510
environment or situation change or in

01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:35,490
some country the court itself actually

01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:39,090
lay some time do the interpretation of

01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:43,650
of the actual written takes right so I

01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:44,640
think or maybe we can go back right and

01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:47,430
I think this this is the thing right

01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:53,280
there's a lot of time or when when it

01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:55,920
comes to the the the read/write of these

01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,660
or international or standards right your

01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,880
entire context where these from civil

01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:02,190
society or is from private sector or

01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,710
whether is from the government right

01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:07,800
a lot of times we not only lie or do

01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:09,660
care much about these comments from the

01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:12,930
special reputable we just stick to the

01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:15,000
some principle that like twenty years or

01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:17,160
twenty years like written like that at

01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,810
the time right so I think like to make

01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,180
it like more updated to bring those

01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:23,100
principal or into the digital age where

01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:30,030
I think like the comments from special

01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:34,950
ritual may help in this area I don't

01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:36,960
know if you miss a camp or you know you

01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:41,100
can you you want to say a few words

01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:44,909
about the child protections and security

01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:44,909
[Music]

01:08:49,260 --> 01:09:10,930
actually in Thailand three on social

01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:19,450
movement and security and half national

01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:24,340
plan under the protection of the plan of

01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:31,570
action and set up the body to increment

01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:34,570
that kind of action plan but I actually

01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:39,340
that the points that I would like to

01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:42,910
talk about about the education is the

01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:46,840
right through education in kind and I

01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:51,280
think we talk about education giving the

01:09:46,840 --> 01:10:02,310
policy education and lifelong education

01:09:51,280 --> 01:10:07,710
and we also have low active learning

01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:13,270
like that you competitive order

01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:16,510
examination for a higher critical

01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:19,630
thinking is not provide critical

01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:24,870
thinking for the students so it lead to

01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:27,970
the media or nation digital digital

01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:32,260
among the children thank thank you

01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:35,400
doctor I think is this a mature is

01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:40,870
engaged in vector the skilled skilled

01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:45,100
access is more important and upon the

01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:51,000
point arrow and access accessibility is

01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:55,330
one component of the media information

01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:59,800
literacy but in school the you didn't

01:10:55,330 --> 01:11:03,150
not excess and black ops you through

01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,150
them access

01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:03,139
okay thank you

01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,630
maybe you can't actually like bring the

01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:12,360
discussion into like into like another

01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:16,260
area about like where we can actually

01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:18,960
get those like figures numbers like or

01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:22,800
two - more or less

01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,320
answers those like questions for the ET

01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,389
caetera sigh that's exactly that's

01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,520
that's that - poison I discussed with

01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:33,020
Simon earlier is like over the first one

01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:35,869
is like it's quite difficult for us to

01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:40,230
get into information for example about

01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:43,110
the languages right that has been used

01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:44,820
by on Thailand or Internet right so

01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:46,770
that's actually a survey right there

01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:51,090
some figures a number is like from the

01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:53,270
Summer Institute of linguistics IL right

01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:56,550
let talk about like the different

01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:59,639
linguistic families in Thailand right so

01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:02,489
there's a high there's like there's

01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:04,050
mooned as a different languages in a

01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:07,800
land right and and there are some

01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:12,050
statistics on that right but those

01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:14,270
numbers are more for the offline

01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:16,160
and like all ethnic groups right in

01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:18,350
different regions right but we don't

01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:20,690
actually have the numbers to actually

01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:22,850
answer directly to to the questions in

01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:26,650
this indicator about like for example if

01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:26,650
the question asks of our example like

01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:36,170
how like what are the percentage of the

01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:39,230
content in central ty what are the

01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:40,960
peasant head of content in or your sign

01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:42,860
language or at the pizza date of life

01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,930
something that right we don't actually

01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:47,150
have the figure for that to answer the

01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:49,430
indicators that's one thing another

01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:54,550
thing is that like sometimes we found

01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:54,550
that like numbers from different

01:13:54,970 --> 01:14:00,350
organization it's not really will a lie

01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:03,050
for example the number of like the

01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:05,060
Internet users right anyone like oh we

01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:07,220
have like a one from in its all right

01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:12,020
which is I think like from from this is

01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:14,840
like from the census right and there's

01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:16,310
one from from from Nick tip which is I

01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:19,270
think like about the protection from

01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:22,610
from the Internet bandwidth right and

01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:24,920
then we have like a 1/4 NPT C which is I

01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:28,070
think more of like subscriptions right

01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:33,980
in terms of like fixed lie and and and

01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:37,580
mobile users so that's that's that one

01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:39,320
thing so it's okay understand about that

01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:40,910
the methodology is like difference right

01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,620
so that's why the figure is is like a

01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:44,450
bit different but sometimes like we see

01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:46,970
like the numbers actually dipping down

01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:49,970
is a quite strange rate that's one thing

01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:54,140
and also sometimes because we don't

01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:56,120
actually have the direc numbers for for

01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:58,070
the indicators we tend to use the

01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:00,980
closest one for example the subway

01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:04,570
bye-bye it da right that talking about

01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:09,740
the consumers of the e-commerce online

01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:12,650
commerce but then again that that

01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:14,360
indicator has it's a little bit

01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:17,840
questionable as well in terms of like

01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:21,130
the population of who actually answer

01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:25,340
the survey because the way we see like

01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:28,910
there's a tendency that Facebook

01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:32,480
users will be the one that more

01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:37,760
represented India docile way because the

01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:39,650
way it da promote the survey right it's

01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:44,960
most of the time promote to these social

01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:46,460
media Facebook right so so that's more

01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,730
of like equations I have to actually

01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:51,950
like to our peak because our limited

01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:54,680
time right there's some limitation to

01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:56,330
actually go through all the our above

01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,680
least resource right so if you actually

01:15:56,330 --> 01:16:00,080
have lower knowledge about like oh

01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,150
actually like these figures or this

01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:08,390
number is already available right please

01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:11,870
do share Thanks I have one more question

01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:14,570
like about whether you did like a

01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:16,850
research covert thought stateless person

01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:19,790
and also the refugees like Thailand we

01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:28,580
have big night cam along the border no

01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:30,560
they're not taking into account let me I

01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:34,730
want to try and put all these points

01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:37,940
together a bit so it is always a problem

01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:42,290
I think in this area that the number of

01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:46,880
users is there are different versions

01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:50,330
that are here and so and it's very

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:54,080
confusing but the best most reliable

01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:56,240
data are the household data from the

01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,580
National Statistics Office if you're

01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:02,330
looking at any country for the together

01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:05,300
sense of the just users that's there a

01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:08,120
lot of the providers Internet service

01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:12,100
providers telecoms companies collect the

01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:16,730
survey data but often there are

01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:20,510
subscriptions and in know nowadays

01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:23,960
people can own several phones phones the

01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:26,600
worker phone for home and and so the

01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:30,050
count can be confusing to say the least

01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:34,040
and the the head of household no I made

01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:36,350
by phone to my child so is it my phone

01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,540
all the children's phone and who is a

01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:39,389
subscription under so there are many

01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,239
questions

01:17:39,389 --> 01:17:50,679
and as art was saying and what we see

01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:53,290
from et da and and the provider data has

01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:56,860
its place but well receive me DDA is

01:17:53,290 --> 01:18:00,010
that the surveys are online an online

01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:03,599
surveys of problematic because they

01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:07,150
don't include people who are not online

01:18:03,599 --> 01:18:09,429
or who don't as art says they don't if

01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:12,540
it's a Facebook survey if you don't log

01:18:09,429 --> 01:18:14,920
into Facebook you're not in the survey

01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:21,639
so there are a lot of issues around

01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:27,639
around there but the that data is clear

01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:29,320
however there are problems which the

01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:33,760
National Statistics Office can answer

01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:36,099
better than I can about very motor areas

01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,440
in terms of households so those

01:18:36,099 --> 01:18:44,080
populations they may be very difficult

01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:46,780
to get to they are they may be I know

01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,150
they're not exactly nomadic but they may

01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:51,070
move between the summer and the winter

01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:53,170
so you make a different picture

01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:56,139
different times of the year there are

01:18:53,170 --> 01:19:00,040
people who are who move across the

01:18:56,139 --> 01:19:02,650
borders legally or illegally and so

01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:05,080
those populations is difficult to get

01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:07,929
accurate data for them and there are

01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:13,119
some surveys in in many countries that

01:19:07,929 --> 01:19:15,639
have tried to address that but the other

01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:19,719
thing on the languages and a personal

01:19:15,639 --> 01:19:21,849
perspective I think is that yes the vast

01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:24,520
majority of the people in Thailand can

01:19:21,849 --> 01:19:28,170
speak Thai but it's not just a question

01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:30,639
of that so for example in education

01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:32,619
UNESCO has a policy that in the first

01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:35,320
years of schooling you should be taught

01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:37,989
in your mother tongue that's what you

01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,810
know you don't need to know you talk to

01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:43,360
your family and and in a way as the

01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:45,849
Internet becomes more universal that

01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,040
should be the same here that you should

01:19:45,849 --> 01:19:50,590
be able to use your mother tongue on the

01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:52,780
internet just as you use it you should

01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:54,250
be able to in early yes at school so

01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:57,610
I think there's a question mark there

01:19:54,250 --> 01:20:00,070
and it's difficult again again all this

01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:00,670
is a question of balance what is the way

01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:03,190
forward

01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:05,650
no this would not be would be less of an

01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:08,230
issue maybe if Thailand wasn't so

01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:09,579
advanced in the internet now it's so

01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:12,099
balancing the internet that it

01:20:09,579 --> 01:20:14,650
highlights these rural areas and these

01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:16,659
more remote areas as being a sticking

01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:19,000
point and that's know as you move

01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:22,869
forward where do we go next and that's

01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:29,730
where you go next I think on the

01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:35,139
question of the skills and education

01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:37,900
lifelong learning I think firstly phones

01:20:35,139 --> 01:20:40,809
in the classroom every countries is

01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:45,460
having this discussion I've heard this

01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:48,760
on the radio in Montreal in Canada and

01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:51,280
even in Montreal one school says yes and

01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:53,980
another school says no one teacher says

01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:56,559
yes and another school says no and and

01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:58,329
it's it's like the child-protection the

01:20:56,559 --> 01:21:00,579
easiest way I think it is to think of it

01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:03,190
as a parent you know you're never quite

01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:05,469
sure what's the best thing to do on the

01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:07,119
internet with your children now so if

01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:09,340
there aren't any principles and and

01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,949
everybody from the classroom upwards is

01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:13,960
trying to find a way as to the best

01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:15,670
places and we're all worried about the

01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:19,750
effect that this is having on children

01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:24,059
so where is there and tying that in a

01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:28,000
little bit to the skills I'm saying

01:21:24,059 --> 01:21:31,750
earlier I think that the skills again

01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:36,550
the skills UNESCO is working to find

01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:39,000
have very thorough statistical

01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:43,780
definition of skills in this area

01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,670
because these are global statistical

01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:48,880
indicators under the sustainable

01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:51,880
development goals but UNESCO hasn't got

01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:54,880
there yet the closest that has got is

01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:58,510
there's a European standard it's more

01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:02,110
asks about activities than skills that

01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:05,099
is the most acceptable statistical

01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:06,700
standard and the International

01:22:05,099 --> 01:22:10,170
Telecommunications Union

01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:14,710
which sets the standards for measuring

01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:18,640
household work on ICTs has has adopted

01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:21,550
that and I think UNESCO is moving

01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,470
towards that too but we haven't got

01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:26,290
there yet but I think it's going to

01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:28,930
happen there's a lot of pressure for

01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:30,780
that to happen and it is it's it's

01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:35,620
extremely difficult to measure skills

01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:38,260
and I can I be was evolved I had

01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:40,350
Liat led a project for two years trying

01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:42,550
to measure literacy on the global level

01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:46,020
it's hard enough just to measure

01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:49,030
literacy you know how to compare

01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:52,300
alphabetic scripts with China a

01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:53,950
geographic scripts for example and

01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:57,670
different standards it's pretty

01:22:53,950 --> 01:23:00,480
impossible and years I wanted to change

01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:00,480
my job and

01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,129
[Music]

01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:17,510
especially regarding to their birthday

01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:20,429
mentions the model with you we 12

01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:23,300
accessibility to all either stop

01:24:20,429 --> 01:24:26,790
indicators dimensions about encryption

01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:30,389
individual access and then you are

01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:31,320
deploying the people we defined by

01:24:30,389 --> 01:24:35,310
geography

01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:40,380
gender is a very recently work done

01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:44,580
I wonder what are people who unit rate

01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:47,850
can recall right so the way that they

01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:51,150
gain information is from from listening

01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:55,670
or seeing but here there are not

01:24:51,150 --> 01:25:00,889
indicators be given any information

01:24:55,670 --> 01:25:04,110
which available in that format but our

01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:06,150
the employment micro baby when we

01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:09,239
defined a couple people we did include

01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:11,630
the volunteer Markway and right so it's

01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:11,630
nothing

01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:23,770
you mentioned Obama's disability

01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:25,870
sometimes a yes right things that on

01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:28,120
decline so you have some money of the

01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:32,740
website that can be somewhere for them

01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:35,800
right bad but that's you many for

01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:38,290
instability what other people say not

01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:40,180
this level but they just cannot be all

01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:42,550
right so they cannot get the knowledge

01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:47,190
from the text so they have to gain a

01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:47,190
knowledge from the cheering organ yeah

01:25:47,310 --> 01:26:00,040
might not be proven game or I think it

01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:05,260
won't it might be possible to produce

01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:07,320
some great about nothing because I'm not

01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:12,180
sure what I'm kind of launching it and

01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:15,070
its own colleagues but like I say I

01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:18,850
spent three years working on was trying

01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:22,120
to measure this you see the normal way

01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:26,230
of measuring indices is simply self

01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:28,900
reporting into the earth and a lot of

01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:32,230
national surveys to ask that question

01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:34,900
and that's used at the global level

01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:38,260
tutor for it's not a very good question

01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:42,940
but it's probably the best still anyone

01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:49,360
we got and and it might be possible to

01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:51,970
them to cross prefer them to the use of

01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:58,030
eyes me peace the would kind of at least

01:26:51,970 --> 01:27:03,160
stay while percentage of difference on

01:26:58,030 --> 01:27:07,060
the marker or either and it would be

01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:10,690
interesting to see and I didn't see what

01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:12,610
that looks like and whether again and in

01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:15,850
the context about three hundred

01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:17,590
indicators we would go into that because

01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:20,140
I suspect it will produce the same

01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:22,990
result saying that and for example

01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:25,870
that's the illiterate people in Thailand

01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:28,640
would largely be in the rural areas in

01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:35,960
the same flu provinces that but

01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:38,570
there before so it is and it is worth

01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:41,270
looking at and I think in particular

01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:45,110
your overall final foe is really

01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:50,870
important so what we're really saying

01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:52,880
here is which given the fact that the

01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:55,880
majority people in Thailand have no

01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:58,070
problems with phones or computers who

01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:00,590
are these people from where to find it

01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:03,080
but risk of left being left behind and

01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:06,320
we want four categories which think

01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:08,270
before that and we need to know what

01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,640
those factors are because that's the

01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:12,350
nature of the problem

01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:15,110
so they may not be disabled but if they

01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:19,690
have free right that in itself may be

01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:19,690
the problem and we'll find them

01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:36,599
I love to fish and manage inefficient

01:28:38,099 --> 01:28:43,349
the question is that - well I reported

01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:51,159
them I just

01:28:43,349 --> 01:28:55,079
documentation thank you hi it's not to

01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:58,539
describe it I did good or bad but I just

01:28:55,079 --> 01:29:00,999
provide a whole picture of our country

01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:05,320
so based on that understanding my

01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:09,880
generation is that we didn't tell you

01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:14,229
until I then what you call will come in

01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:20,499
with the wonderful indicator inspector

01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:31,420
in the guy named Tanya Tanya and the

01:29:20,499 --> 01:29:36,400
teacher and pizza inside of our picture

01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:40,389
of all I do is not bad but it is later

01:29:36,400 --> 01:30:06,760
you are looking on Twitter but the

01:29:40,389 --> 01:30:10,599
partition I know it's it's bad

01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:13,659
subscription and no idea okay Mike

01:30:10,599 --> 01:30:18,039
magenta are now we are living like

01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:22,239
mobile era and to what extent this gold

01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:26,590
pan of tales but I also think that

01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:28,989
ideology about I give people of the

01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:31,449
issue is that the availability of the

01:30:28,989 --> 01:30:34,840
ipv4 but now we are moving to LA

01:30:31,449 --> 01:30:38,229
decreasing so what is it that can

01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:42,479
actually relation to know more at the

01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:42,479
object between the

01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:57,830
okay so I think the first is your first

01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:00,480
question

01:30:57,830 --> 01:31:03,080
there's certainty who's not the sense

01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:06,570
radiance that really kind of see

01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:09,720
anything as good or bad for obviously

01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:12,060
for each category and overall there is

01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:16,430
an understanding that bomb moving

01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:21,390
towards recommendation so I think

01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:23,490
obviously any kind of reform tends to

01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:24,600
have something these which says this is

01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:27,750
the way forward

01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:29,790
and I think that's the front there but

01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:32,460
on the other hand there are obviously

01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:38,940
some indicators which lend themselves

01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:42,720
more to a clear and dynamic one way or

01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:45,150
the other numbers of internet uses if

01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:48,930
obviously one of those indicators and

01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:52,320
you want to see moving to 100% and I

01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:56,070
don't think as questions about that

01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:59,130
so the broadband and IP addresses I

01:31:56,070 --> 01:32:03,270
think simplest thing to say is that it

01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:03,810
is a global standard and in certain

01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:08,870
countries

01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:15,420
don't be more relevant than others I

01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:20,370
think that's true in Island but for

01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:25,920
example in I'm shortly to go to work on

01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:29,100
this area in Liberia in Africa in my

01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,800
birria problem is actually no

01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:34,410
electricity or is good in fact

01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:35,940
cell phone coverage everywhere but

01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:40,610
there's nowhere to charge your cell

01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:43,710
phone and so fixed linesman broadband

01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:48,060
posts tend to be the way forward still

01:32:43,710 --> 01:33:00,620
in in Liberia and I think it's really

01:32:48,060 --> 01:33:00,620
difficult even on that basis after you

01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:32,730
also we call it indicators actually it's

01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:34,440
where statistically it's not all of them

01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:36,960
are not indicators they are like

01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:39,810
standards and of course there is a

01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:42,780
vision behind the indicators because you

01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:44,639
know UNESCO advocate for an Internet in

01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:46,800
which you know everyone on which

01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:49,469
everyone can expect freely their opinion

01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:53,100
without you know being put in a jail and

01:33:49,469 --> 01:33:57,540
so the indicators behind the right it's

01:33:53,100 --> 01:34:00,750
also you know there is a vision and an

01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:03,389
intention behind for an Internet to be

01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:06,530
you know human right based you know open

01:34:03,389 --> 01:34:06,530
and accessible so on

01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,280
you might have a follow-up question and

01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:18,540
stable if that falls silent thing

01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:21,710
what is UNESCO okay so I think why is

01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:24,540
this focus mr. UNESCO and back open

01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:27,900
perennial or has bit by it if I go wrong

01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:30,389
but it's also a sense for this is a

01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:33,420
mistake the kind of statement that where

01:34:30,389 --> 01:34:38,880
it's highly news on the Internet

01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:42,060
so many people in the global Internet

01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:45,030
will or in events that that causes will

01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:47,489
be able to pick up report and farewell

01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:48,150
this is what the internet was like in

01:34:47,489 --> 01:34:50,340
Thailand

01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:52,440
so this is what the time breathing

01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:54,690
verbal and pain in Napa

01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:57,420
this is popping numbers blanking they

01:34:54,690 --> 01:35:01,110
knew not to say that one is better or

01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:05,370
worse the other participant and believe

01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:08,790
it yes and for me as well I think that

01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:11,100
the Internet is now in some of the same

01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:13,920
people at the meeting of IQ

01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:15,510
Geneva last week and they were saying

01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,230
that the internet is going to be on

01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:23,220
technology no that with the Internet of

01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:26,400
Things nowadays people don't know that

01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:29,760
they're on the instep or not I get in my

01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:33,630
car I don't work like GPS if you think

01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:35,190
of satellite or the Internet when we

01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:40,820
have these things plugged in our brain

01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:46,170
in a few years time we won't know and so

01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:49,110
it's it's also a sense of that we use

01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:51,780
the net is taking different character in

01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:54,570
different parts of the world so as I've

01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:56,810
said again here you see the financial

01:35:54,570 --> 01:36:00,360
payment systems which is really advanced

01:35:56,810 --> 01:36:04,890
but similar to China Davis is a nation

01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:09,840
effective in North America they're not

01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:10,770
advancing on payment so they're going in

01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,770
a different direction

01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:17,040
and maybe again in the Buffett's will do

01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:19,320
at a time if people see a different

01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:21,450
character of the internet in different

01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:23,100
regions and different places and that

01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:27,420
will come out to be support as well

01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:29,690
because they are qualitative as much as

01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:29,690
anything

01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:40,130
Kuras I'm on you and yeah I need last

01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:40,130
