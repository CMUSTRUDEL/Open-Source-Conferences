development sandbox and survey to tell

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,959
Toby global brand challenges and of

00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,840
course our you know since 2016 the

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,030
United Nations Human Rights Council

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,099
release and non-binding resolutions

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,049
condemning into the intentional

00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,420
destruction of Internet access by

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,090
governments the resolution will promote

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,579
that the same rights people have of

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,919
limas also be protected online that's

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,890
why we are here today reionization

00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,780
internet will

00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:23,150
recommendation on later a third universe

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,790
periodic review mechanisms as diverse as

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,130
the related to the right to food and the

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,750
right to water earth which are

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,970
well-established human rights

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,400
so today the right to detect answers

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,200
also no one has the right to prepare or

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,150
freedom to connect is to view that all

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,460
people must be able to access the

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,280
Internet in order to exercise and enjoy

00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,410
the rights to eat on two of expressions

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,780
and opinions another fundamental human

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,270
rights and that states have a

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,640
responsibility to ensure that Internet

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:56,030
access is broadly available and that

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,700
states can reasonably frustrated to

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,760
individuals access to the Internet right

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,040
so this is the reason why internet

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,540
university assessment is important to

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,940
the community especially the young

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,630
generation we as NAA also work a lot

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,060
with you and intrapreneurship university

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,790
in order to use you know these digital

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,700
devices of digital instruments of

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,220
Internet assessment and with you know

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,530
all these it can take a lot of time and

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,510
money and often the assessment can be

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,510
completed in less time and multiple

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,490
candidates come from.he and complete the

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,870
online assessment at the same time and

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,630
there's no need for specialized

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,630
personnel so we can be you suppose the

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,620
cause and the time using you know all

four-dose important to these to deceive

an exampie but also really you're

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,610
providing a very comprehensive view of

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,950
the internet ecosystem reaching through

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,960
not only illness which is a very very

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,780
important principle as we discuss

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,360
promoting for the internet and open from

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,130
the right perspective and also from the

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,840
vertex take other perspective because

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,210
you're coming also from different

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,150
background by the industry private

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,720
sectors government so this is why we are

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,970
only here before we move to the to the

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,220
session itself I'd like also to give the

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,700
float Mario Mario is the founder of

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,820
force Asia which is a community of open

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,890
tech developers across Asia and this is

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,650
the on project summit is mainly

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,990
organized by force Asia in partnership

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,680
with ni a and Business Council Mario

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,120

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,340
well thank you very much for giving me

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,160
the opportunity to the sacred words so

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,980
yeah we appreciate very much that you

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,680
come here and yeah I've seen many events

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,230
the UNESCO and happening all around the

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,100
world just like we people there was the

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:19,380
day for the access to information and

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,560
Internet freedom we participated also

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:26,460
last year and Sri Lanka and Harrison

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,380
everywhere so I think like that yeah of

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:34,110
course I would also like to thank ni a

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:37,670
for event and when I hear to you you're

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,580
tall I think it is the right thing na

00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,930
as part of the ministry of education

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,900
because access to Internet is very

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,190
important not just to use technology but

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,200
actually to understand technology

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,000
shouldn't just use something that maybe

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,960
comes from another country that it's

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,970
closed source code we don't know and if

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,800
they have maybe access to our

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,220
government's information or to our

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,950
citizens information and like the

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:08,240
countries should decide how they

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:11,360
implement the policies or what they want

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,750
to happen in their country so open

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,690
source for us it's a good tool here

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,850
because we can see the source code every

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,830
country computer experts they can look

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,230
into it we can understand what's going

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,410
on with both Asia and we're developing

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,030
software we also develop hardware now

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,520
because it's actually not just the

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,860
software it's also half that we need to

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,800
know and understand what's happening on

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,900
the hardware so then you see we are very

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,120
hands on event maybe you saw some

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,910
volunteers here they come in actually

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,030
decide on time people we have 30 young

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,680
Thai people they signed up as volunteers

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:52,160
and they helped to run the event and

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,020
this is also how we educate people Hanks

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,910
form is not just like top-down approach

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,410
it's self-guided learning and they

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,230
allowed also to make some mistakes but

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:03,050
it works really well we have example our

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,940
largest event in Singapore with 3,000

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:10,250
people every year so our main office is

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:11,600
in Singapore and yeah grows the forces

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,570
we have hackathons we have a lot of

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,910
activities and we always want to come to

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,440
Thailand but we're missing a bit the

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,060
link entitled you know everyone wants to

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,160
go to Thailand

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,070
we don't just want to come like some

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,530
foreigners once right come to come to

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,750
Thailand and then like make the event

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,670
because we're interested in the

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:37,090
cooperation as you can see if I'm

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:40,700
impatient I'm from Germany I'm already

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:43,370
so so I'm from Germany and so I used to

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,280
organize business conferences for the EU

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,310
and in ancient that's how I came and

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,720
like more than 10 years ago to Asia and

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,320
not just like Southeast Asia also

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,030
Central Asia different countries and

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,740
that's how I came and of course it is

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,780
just a good experience in danger because

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,220
as you know that population is growing

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,080
and everything and we have not stopped

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,350
conferences actually I remember meeting

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,630
our teeth what was it RT 2008 or 2009

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,220
something like that in Singapore and so

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,580
a lot of things happening I'm really

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,270
excited this trend of like starting from

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:24,740
school continued here in Thailand and we

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,960
have now this wonderful building yeah

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,910
the first see all this building design

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,670
is building yesterday at the conference

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,980
and made a panel together so this was so

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,720
nice because this building symbolizes

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,370
the openness that we also want to

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,950
achieve with it's all software so it's

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,720
many levels and I'm really happy to see

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,820
so many participants and your interest

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,250
and I hope you can cooperate more in

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,860
future unfortunately the co-founder home

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,860
foot and she can't because she's at the

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,870

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,460
contact with her later

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,800
she is hopefulness so it's not just a

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,630
project of some foreigners but actually

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,980
