hello everyone my name is Francisco

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,400
muñoz álvarez and the founder and CEO of

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,980
cloudy be I'm here today to talk about

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,070
does cloud me in the end of the DBA and

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,470
about the evolution of the DBA career

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,660
with the help of emerging technologies a

00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,359
little bit about myself as I mention my

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,820
name is Francisco - Alvarez I have been

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,090
working with database technologies

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,969
basically for 30 years now just over 20

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,460
years and most of the with this time

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,950
work with Oracle technologies but also

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,930
working with many emerging technologies

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,539
or they are DBMS sequel server my sequel

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,070
open source databases and spice equal to

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:53,309
and many others pause grids and our

00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,949
cloud-based environments with basically

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,219
our cloud vendors around around the

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,350
globe at the moment and with regard with

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,480
Oracle have you been working and our

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,320
also being a better tested since the

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,510
Oracle version 7 I have won a few awards

documentation tutorials webinars and

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,160
things happen about the database

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,069
technology plan technology on the

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,290
in the right corner you have my book

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,260
Oracle Database 12c backup and recovery

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,360
Survival Guide was the first book to be

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,690
published about this topic with Oracle

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,450
ouch a version from C and also right now

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:34,319
write in a book for to a press cloud

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:39,510
about the modern DBA and that will be

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,190
coming in the next few maps I don't like

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,349
to talk a little bit much about

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,110
marketing but I would like to just say

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,810
that my company cloudy B these are

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,450
global professional manager services not

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,600
only for Oracle technologies is for most

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:58,099
of the our DBMS no sequin environment

00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:03,150
open source databases such as my sequel

00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:05,610
MariaDB Basra's and so on we have many

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,040
community leaders say working with or as

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,470
members of our team we have a few

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,930
work--we since ace directors oracle

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,890
certified masters microsoft MPP is

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:20,040
Microsoft Microsoft MCM s some AWS

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:25,790
solutions architects developers and so

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:28,829
on that means we have a very good

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,989
knowledge about many technologies and

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:34,920
many single people in community leaders

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:37,109
working with us our main office a is in

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,690
Brisbane Australia had corns we have

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,760
offices houses in Sydney Perth in

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,670
Auckland New Zealand in San Francisco

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,889
United States we also have clients

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,209
around the globe that we support with

00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:53,840
real follow-the-sun

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:59,040
and that included Singapore Korea Japan

00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:03,359
Russia Kazakhstan in Europe United

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,200
States and so on and we also have a

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,639
group of employees

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,500
supporting these environments from our

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,230
on the globe also

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,400
but saying that let's go straight to the

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,609
point of what they're going to be

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,100
talking today my main goal today is just

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,800
talk about database technologies around

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,380
especially for DBAs database

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,380
administrators and talk a little bit

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,100
stunning with devolution of IT the past

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:37,550
the present and the future of the

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:41,590
database career and what's next next and

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,770
finish with a full review and conclusion

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,290
okay

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,460
let's talk about evolution of a career

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,940
you will see many changes I have I have

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,650
seen many changes since I started I

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,050
basically didn't find myself with the

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,440
cartoon in the middle when I started on

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,780
my careers in the in the late 80s I was

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,600
like that cartoon very skinny and young

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,930
and now I'm a little bit fatter and and

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,169
older and my computer of course went the

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,790
other way but I T have evolved a lot

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:18,890
since I started as per example if we

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,229
start talking about evolution and IT in

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:25,190
general we will see that everything is

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:32,390
started with the human computers back in

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:36,560
the 40s to the 70s even the a movie

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,770
recently was released showing the

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,200
history about this when basically we

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,140
have the human computers working for al

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,150
NASA and they were very scared with the

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,580
changes on the profession with the

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,770
implementation IBM the first IBM

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,960
mainframe there's going to be the

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,140
supercomputer that will replace out that

00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,229
people and that was the star of the main

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:03,260
evolution on the computer systems then

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,500
with the general mainframes be starting

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,470
to replace the human computers between

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,770
the 60 to the 80s we we talk a lot about

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,229
IBM and the big iron when we talk about

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,960
that you can see this picture just the

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:21,650
big fast with the delivery over five

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,540
megabytes hard drives from iba IBM back

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,730
in 1956

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,980
could see how big was the technology

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,200
hardware's and how many things were

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,650
changing if you take a look on how the

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,010
size of you have a one terabyte external

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,770
hard drive is very simple and even the

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,720
pen drives

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,260
we're in even with mine frames we have

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,930
that kind of work we've details we have

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,790
the operators working in maintaining

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,210
these environments working from the

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:57,920
consoles and that was very frequent and

00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:02,420
common to a lot of people upon us at the

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,730
moment then in the ages we have the

00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,730
distributed technology being being

00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:11,840
introduced it and start to separate that

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,640
to words between people and computers we

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,450
start having our terminals to be

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,920
introduces that we started to work

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,440
separated we need to be in the work in

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,990
the consoles anymore this was a big

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,090
change in a big steps especially with

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,910
the computers is starting to connect as

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,660
a multi layer that we have the PC is

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,880
connected to the central computer and so

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,430
on but if we take a look on the

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,660
evolution of IT since in these studies

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:44,600
in the forest up to to today and 2020 we

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,580
will see how the changes that happen we

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,780
starting with the human computers moving

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,030
to the mainframes

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,000
they're moving to the client servers

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,340
then we start with the private cloud and

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,580
other people ask me in francisco what do

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,820
you mean with private cloud in 2010 we

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,910
have a boom and a rush to the people to

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,120
start visualizing their own data centers

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:11,300
when you visualize your own data centers

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,880
basically what you were chief is created

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,490
on the private cloud that was the star

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,650
of the cloud technology but inside their

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,400
own firewalls inside their own data

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:26,720
centers this was the boom that started

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,210
with the Vito era back in 2010 then we

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,390
start with other companies start to push

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,510
especially with AWS as the big initial

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,110
push to implement public cloud a lot of

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,450
people started to play around

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,479
started working with one we call hybrid

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,459
cloud having most of the work and the

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,010
workload on their private clouds and

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,410
some they were playing with non

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,209
production environment especially in the

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,510
public cloud creating what we call

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:58,399
hybrid clouds a mix of stuff on premises

00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:02,670
and and other stuff in the public cloud

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,940
by 2020 we expect them most of the

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,550
people will be using a public cloud and

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,829
start to using most of their things on

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,380
private cloud or hybrid clouds that's

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:18,269
basically what most of the people is

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:20,490
expecting to happen and and that's why

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:24,120
something that we need to take a look

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,950
and see how the fields evolve before if

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,740
you just give a step back and take a

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,140
look on the evolution of IT and put now

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,740
my my shoes as a database administrator

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,110
that I had done for most of the time if

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,380
you step back you will remember in the

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,779
80s a lot of changes for developers is

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,240
starting to work in that way - most of

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,850
the developers I knew in that time were

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,029
working with computer technology

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:54,269
assertions let's say cobble and with the

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,760
- I take I mean a lot of things a lot of

00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:59,279
the other technology is starting to be

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,019
implemented in that moment a lot of

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,490
people start working with something new

00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,500
cow and squirrel sequel and and the

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,490
people were saying now that's not the

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,130
future Cabo is in that people they stay

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,890
working with the old technologies they

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,410
become the dinosaurs went if you compare

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:22,800
where if we compare what's happening and

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:25,230
next because they didn't want it to

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,470
evolve and they started slowly to

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,050
extinguish and be extended and that's

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:35,579
something that a lot of people is asking

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:37,620
would that happen - DBAs also because we

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,810
didn't plan implementation evolution and

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,870
evolution of IT with implementation of

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,670
cloud technologies

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,310
autonomous that amazing vironment such

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,889
as people call are the heirs of Oracle

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:55,449
pranams databases will do the effect of

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:59,290
and that is a big big big question that

00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:01,329
we have and many people is doing if we

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,079
take a look in the past as I measure as

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:06,790
me being a DBA you will see that when I

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:09,939
started my career back in the late

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,369
eighties I started as a measure as a

00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,519
developer when we start working with the

00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:18,249
Oracle databases at the moment and we

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,589
not even know that the database

00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:22,480
administrator was required once

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,549
basically assuming the technology was

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,779
just run in the background by itself and

00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:31,449
we just need to keep developing programs

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:33,220
and working and that's it in that time I

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:36,279
was working with technologies such as

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:42,429
Oracle forms or a core Airport Oracle

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:44,889
case Oracle menu and so on and basically

00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:47,439
with the time we discovered the database

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,629
and are efficient but they are not that

00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:52,299
efficient that they need someone to

00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:55,029
maintain the technology properly to

00:11:52,299 --> 00:12:00,459
ensure the availability recovery ability

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:03,939
of the data and allow the things run

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:07,360
smoothly and that's when I started to

00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:10,720
work as a DBA I was the first DBA from

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,959
Brazil and one of the first API is of

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,860
Latin America was also the first Oracle

00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:19,899
certified master from Latin America and

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,790
I was a member of the first team to

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:26,290
introduce Oracle in that moment to

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,419
Brazil and in that time when I was

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,519
working as a DBA was something very

00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:34,449
simple were just working with one or two

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:37,660
databases very small ones the main

00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:39,819
issues were that as a DBA I was working

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,339
at different times of the teams because

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:45,009
most of the work that was able to do

00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:47,019
backup defragmentation and so on

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:51,309
we need to be done with the database

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:54,249
down that means at night and weekends

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:57,789
and that's when I was working with then

00:12:54,249 --> 00:13:02,529
as a DBA we start to see a lot of

00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:04,540
changes that was happening and new

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,250
technologies were introduced is

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,410
specially if your database administrator

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,390
we start to see if you are just giving

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,120
us a reference a few things with Oracle

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,700
we start having things as reapplication

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,100
cluster cluster is a SHINee start to be

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,560
implemented software to manage in

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,560
storage as a SM of autonomy storage

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,940
management is starting to be implemented

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,860
a monitoring and managing tools graphic

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,820
tools good that allows you to do things

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,530
for easily instead to know the

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,670
command-line interface and I know how to

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:41,530
do the things by yourself a lot of

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,070
things is starting to be implemented

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:47,940
that change the way your current career

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,920
was going especially if you think

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,140
another thing that with the years you

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,120
were supposed to learn was you learn how

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,700
the applications work how do you

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,650
interact with the database that way when

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,110
I issue happens you know how it happens

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,840
we start to become a moral architect

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,420
than the database only we start become

00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,240
since that means that word means user

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,410
that means and many other things because

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,990
we start gaining a lot more

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,590
responsibility and even with database

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,320
technologies itself and many companies

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,690
especially managers start to acquire new

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,390
products new software's new applications

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,460
without pay attention in the database

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,730
technology in the background and then

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,460
you start ending up with other database

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:37,090
to manage a civil service progress my

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:40,930
sequel and so on and when we raise our

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,030
hands to complain look my Oracle DBA and

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,070
this is not Oracle databases or I am a

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,800
sequel DBA and this is not a sequel

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,900
database and why I need to look after

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,300
they will reply to your manager will

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,700
reply to you look your contra cells you

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,370
are a database administration DBA this

00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,310
is a database now is your responsibility

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,500
and then the things are starting to to

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,340
grow we grow with more responsibilities

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:09,750
it starts to be a added toward

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,490
professional as a database administrator

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,130
deep within our policies with the

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,860
present a lot of changes it start to be

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:20,589
implemented on your career

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,769
taking consideration with the

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:26,500
implementation of cloud technology is

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:29,920
automation so many different things

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,630
started to be used that is a lot of

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,180
people think that

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,650
professional starts to deviate it and we

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,720
are becoming as I mentioned they are

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,940
given the sample before with developers

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,190
with Kabul we are going close to

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:48,010
extinction where we are the next

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,800
dinosaurs and basically in the

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:54,890
technology world and I can tell that as

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,820
a reference that could be true in some

00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:02,060
level but that's not in my opinion if

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,520
you pay attention with AWS they have

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,220
implemented RDS and a lot of people

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,680
think oh we've used my company starting

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:14,000
to use the RDS they will manage itself

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,830
and DBAs will not be required oh my gosh

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,590
I need to start looking for a new job or

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,830
I start to change or evolve or merging

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:25,670
in something else different my personal

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:28,340
experience with RDS is I love our ideas

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,580
why because I'm making more money I have

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,910
more work supporting RDS environments

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:38,480
than ever before why because this

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:43,310
technology were supposed to come to be

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,140
replace most of the DBA work but that's

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,920
what we're supposed to do but that's not

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:52,970
what exactly happening if you take a

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,490
look on what they do basically they are

00:16:52,970 --> 00:17:00,170
supposed to be locked supposed to be a

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:02,570
Ultima manager by itself but they

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,900
limited so much the things happening

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:09,170
around and what you can do that

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,900
performance is not always as inspected

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,900
or all is easy to manage your words down

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,760
on premises those as you can do when

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,699
using something as infrastructure as a

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,490
service then you can basically fully

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:25,220
deploy the cloud your applications your

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,640
databases but you have full control of

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,590
everything and you still have an access

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,740
to the y-axis you have an access to

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:37,100
everything you need it but we have RDS

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,760
not you now have limited database

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,490
accounts you have parameters limitations

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,070
what you can set and do and that now you

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,460
need to you know require

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,470
a special skill set to manage that

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,710
environments and to make that be more

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,960
efficient and the amount of people

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,030
available in the market that know what

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,390
to do how to manage it and the kind of

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,670
environments it's not that many people

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,560
available that have the knowledge that

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,020
means now you will become a specialized

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,670
of that and you can make more money and

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,600
you'll become even more essential than

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:17,210
before that's something they need to be

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,570
taken in consideration about that kind

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,880
of technologies I had a session that was

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,580
given for many years Karl tips and best

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,940
practices for DBAs and one of my tips

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,310
was of most importance after back up

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,600
back up and back up I always do a backup

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,220
before a change you're always doing

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,980
backup after a change it was automation

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,880
automated everything you can automate it

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,010
do it because you have more important

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,740
things to do it

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,510
if you cannot automate something

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,030
delegate but that's why you have a

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,030
junior dbaas and other people that can

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,800
look after the environment for you

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,350
because again you have more important

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,140
things to do most of the issues that

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,990
management have with DBA is they always

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,640
when they require things to DBAs then

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,680
they don't have a time they're they're

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,640
busy or they're unavailable to do things

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,250
why because they are very busy dude when

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,530
we call business as usual they always

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,690
doing the same things over and over and

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:24,140
over especially if you're not proactive

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:28,430
your reactive DBA you end up being a

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:33,070
firefighter taking that fire out and

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:37,250
another one is on and so on then what a

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:40,460
critical a project is going to be

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,470
implemented is a strategic project in

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,020
the pipeline you basically never

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,490
available you know and that start

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,160
causing all the issues with management

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:53,060
and see why I'm being dispersion person

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,470
that's never available apologize for

00:19:53,060 --> 00:20:00,570
back off

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:04,180
that's why I am you need to change in my

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:07,420
experience I can tell you that at the

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:10,710
present we have two types of DBAs when

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:14,920
we are workout DB O's and DBAs

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,050
dpl's our database operators that is DBA

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,110
is still doing the same business as

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,270
usual as always keeping their time is

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:26,200
just doing the same thing over and over

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:28,240
and over and then you have the DBAs they

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,610
do not means anymore database

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,520
administrators they means database

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,980
architects in my opinion that's the

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,370
people that automated most of the things

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,620
that they could automate why to focus

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,020
and if any strategic projects for the

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,600
company and try to achieve it before a

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,120
better return of investment more

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,920
availability more recoverability more

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,690
security and so on and that's what you

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,780
need to start thinking that's the

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,910
present of the your profession to think

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,310
if you are a DB o or you're going in the

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,350
database operator direction or you doing

00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:08,260
going in the database architect

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,240
direction if you're going to go to the

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,550
database architect direction to give

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,340
that step back and start looking on

00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:17,740
better options to your company if you

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:21,550
take a look on this information from

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:24,910
database maestro that Oracle and talked

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,710
a lot about you will see the DBA spend

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,190
much of their time in these areas

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,380
maintenance security reliability where

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,930
seventy-two percent of IT badge

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,370
budgets are in spend on generic

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:41,020
maintenance tasks versus innovation and

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,190
85 percent of security breaches occur

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,780
after the CBA was published and

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,790
ninety-one percent experienced

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:52,840
employment data center autologous

00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:55,150
because environments are not reliable if

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,950
you take in average a database downtime

00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,160
caused around seven thousand nine

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:03,310
hundred US dollars per minute that from

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,070
database master information and this is

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,930
the time this is areas that we

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,930
basic

00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,610
we spent too much time in maintenance if

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,550
you take a look we are not able to

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,210
innovate we are not able to focus on

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:20,190
security properly and we are not able to

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,250
properly guarantee the reliability

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,640
availability of our environments

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:29,610
especially of the data if you think

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,480
about that remember the data is the new

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:37,230
oil and we are database architects are

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,390
the new people that will be able to

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:45,510
focus in how to keep the data secure

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:48,000
available reliable and recoverable for

00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:52,800
everyone in the company we need to

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,780
manage that oil properly and that's the

00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:00,450
thing that you need to start changing

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:03,600
your mind and start focus on you need to

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,880
focus your mind and start becoming that

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,360
architect not anymore

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,480
operator operators can be easy replace

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,580
it architects not you need to start to

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,350
being more strategic to your company and

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,690
start to think on ways that you can give

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,330
you more return of investment to you to

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,360
your business if not you'll be in

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:30,300
trouble but other questions that other

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,000
people ask me is Francisco is the DBA

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:38,610
professional going down is his people

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,060
starting to Heidi bas if it that's not

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,770
true

00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,740
take a look at statistics from the

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,750
United States in 2016 the database

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,920
professor is still one of the most

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:53,580
importance they high demand occupations

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,100
in United States you can see that these

00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:01,560
are faster than average the job outlook

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:05,280
with 11% grow a number of jobs being

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,530
published in 2016 was 119 thousand five

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,180
hundred united states at the example and

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:15,030
high pay and that was in 2016 if it's

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,130
looking in May 2017 when everybody was

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,650
saying already starting to say that DBS

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,519
would be obsolete they continue it grow

00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:26,429
still

00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:28,349
being of a high demand a profession the

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:30,419
number of employees to hire a hundred

00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:33,690
thirteen thousand people looking right

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:36,539
there it just in the United States and

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,139
plenty of 36 if you go to the computer

00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:42,570
computer science hub you will see that

00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:45,239
DBA Professor Steve or handle a high

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,609
demand globally but you need to think

00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:49,859
that DBAs are not anymore

00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:52,109
that amazin miss traders there are being

00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,599
required to be more architect kind of

00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:57,239
things they need to have a new skill set

00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,719
so you need to include things like cloud

00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:03,389
computing in network security and so on

00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:06,389
and that's the things need to be aware

00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:08,459
of if I just go here in Australia for

00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:13,469
example just Google database

00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:15,779
administrator in Australia we are as big

00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:17,669
country with a small population when

00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:21,539
compared with the United States but you

00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:23,219
can see 5800 job openings just for

00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:27,779
database administration's here in

00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:29,669
Australia the pay we pay is very high

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:33,059
it's still when the professions we have

00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:35,369
were the best buys payments in IT but

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,729
you can see that popular skill set for

00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:41,429
senior database administrators are

00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:47,399
growing they require you to have a multi

00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:49,739
a technologies background oh s level and

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:53,419
knowledge with line notes UNIX windows

00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:56,639
so on you need to have a cloud

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:58,889
technology a little bit of DevOps a

00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:03,629
little bit of machine learning or so on

00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:07,859
more skill sets better chances to grow

00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:09,950
in better pay rates to and that's the

00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,419
things that you will find that database

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:16,320
administrators still high demand

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:19,200
globally at the moment as part of the

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,690
present as I mentioned you need to have

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,679
knowledge about cloud computing that's

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:28,499
not that maybe that's not a good to have

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,320
that is a full requirement that you need

00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:32,769
to have

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,820
now at the moment you need to know what

00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:39,130
offerings Amazon AWS has as your Google

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,639
cloud platform Oracle that's the

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,710
foremost use it a cloud computing and

00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:46,539
providers around the world you need to

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,210
understand what infrastructures of

00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:52,570
service are is what platform as a

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:55,090
service is what SAS is and what

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,940
offerings for infrastructure as a

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,090
service pass and SAS each cloud

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,159
providers have that is something that

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,070
you need to start investing your time

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:11,440
start to getting some training we start

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:14,009
to getting certified cloud is not the

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,779
future anymore we are ready there and

00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:21,610
that's what we need to be prepared and

00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:23,970
learn more so we can together with cloud

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,980
computing a cloud not experience

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,990
automation is part of the future as I

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,389
mentioned before you should automate

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,909
everything you can why because you have

00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:35,529
more important things to do if you don't

00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,779
do the things that important to your

00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:40,090
company you will become the next

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,970
dinosaur and we don't want that to

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:46,240
happen that's why you need to start

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:49,269
thinking about automation very very

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,149
seriously you have many products many

00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:55,389
tools that you can work with and that's

00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:59,710
when we start talking about git git hub

00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:01,799
and proud to say about source control

00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,730
like it I measure getting it up

00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:09,759
automation tools DevOps and so on

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:12,460
there's are things that are not a joke

00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,330
anymore as part of the evolution of the

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,710
DBA and the database developer role and

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,169
you need to learn that you need to

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,960
become a data engineer as I mentioned

00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:25,179
the data is the new oil you need to be

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,200
strong we need to have strong knowledge

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:32,129
on data security that's a mess also you

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,409
should also concentrate and learn about

00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:38,049
mashing learning mashing learning

00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:40,120
blockchain that technologies that I

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,650
started to be embedded in the database

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,060
technologies more and more

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,000
that's something that you should be

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,680
looking if you're not looking already

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,170
and now so start working with

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,530
application tuning about improving this

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:57,500
they ask well connection management and

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:00,010
so on to be a the application

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,850
connectivity to your data more efficient

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:07,340
that's important strings as I mentioned

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:10,130
you need to focus in the future now and

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,640
the future is very close that means you

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,710
should start looking at this right now

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,770
not take your time anymore if you not

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:22,790
you will become basically obsolete very

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,100
soon again start looking on devups start

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:29,180
looking containers start looking on

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,430
cloud computing automation big data this

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,440
kind of technology source control source

00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:38,800
versioning how these things are very

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:42,680
very important and the skill sets that

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:47,420
every database architect should know and

00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:50,060
have in your pocket a lot of people tell

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,770
me is the food future now now the future

00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:56,210
is none of them know the future is very

00:29:51,770 --> 00:30:00,160
very known and the future is now

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:04,070
basically is about everything I read

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,770
about the examples I've already given to

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:09,500
you if you just look back and disturb my

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,450
presentation I spoke about the hidden

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,580
figures the movie movie that talked

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,960
about human computers and Nas are being

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:19,640
replaced by the mainframe from IBM I

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,620
really recommend you to watch that movie

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:27,790
if you have seen yet you will see how

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,770
the human computers where always care

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:34,100
about losing their jobs you have a

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:36,080
feeling of a innovator people among them

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,480
they started to see an opportunity

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,980
instead of a trap with the

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,670
implementation of the mind frame the IBM

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:50,120
people was had an amazing product there

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:54,260
was a faster way to do things than human

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,250
computers and a lower cost but they have

00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,890
issues

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,770
to making that thing work even without

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:04,130
the technology and capability it was not

00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:07,549
working for NASA that's where the human

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:10,400
computers and notice that they have one

00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:12,860
thing that machines did not have they

00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,580
had one thing that the new technology

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:20,179
did not have at all and what was that

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:23,630
knowledge of the business then then they

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:26,840
discover if they start learning coding

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,510
and become developers they will be able

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,140
to transfer that knowledge of the

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,750
business

00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,580
to that new technology the hardware to

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,210
make that thing work properly as

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,480
expected

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,730
that's where basically IBM hard how do

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,150
you mean computers to become the new

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,100
programmers and making sharing that

00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,770
knowledge of the business made that

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:53,030
technology work efficiently as expected

00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:56,409
and that's the same for the DBS today we

00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:59,630
have new tools new toys new technologies

00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:03,350
but they are useless without the

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:05,799
knowledge of the business and we do DBAs

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,510
the new database architectures have

00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:12,289
technology on our brains and we need to

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,059
start using that to be able to together

00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:17,570
with these new tools that we have been

00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:22,220
giving we can make our careers and your

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:24,429
future very very successful when we talk

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:28,100
about the future a lot of people confuse

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:30,200
automation versus autonomous automation

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:34,159
is one thing Ultron was another thing

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,809
now if you take one idea automation is

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:41,390
what we use it to make things a

00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:43,789
basically automate it and automations

00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:47,120
they do by themselves let's take you one

00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:50,679
example a couple years back about a new

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:54,140
car and my car have a lot of automation

00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,299
in Babylon it as per example they

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,970
automatically turn on the lights when

00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:02,299
they detect that is getting dark they

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,130
automatically turn on the lights

00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,440
if they start detecting they start

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:08,330
raining and it's and I also change it is

00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,169
setting on the speed dependent

00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:15,769
how heavily Iranian is my cruise control

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:17,840
now is automato cruise control that they

00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:20,210
keep the distance they break through the

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,309
car in front of me break they increase

00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:26,419
the velocity they do everything by

00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:29,000
itself without me doing nothing they do

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,309
everything by itself you have even a

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,419
system parking that I can press a bottom

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:37,460
and my car park by itself you could take

00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:40,010
a look on loudest things these

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,830
automation features on my car I'm not

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,980
there to remove the pleasure of driving

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:50,510
my car but is to make it more safer

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:53,659
reduce risk that means I can enjoy the

00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,880
travel even more when my car is doing a

00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:59,269
lot of things for me to keep me safe and

00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,690
be enabled me to get to my destination

00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,889
without issues and enjoy my family my

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,980
kids and so on

00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:09,560
that's basically the same concept when

00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,540
you apply to IT how the automation

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,599
products you have how the automation you

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,490
can deploy will make you reduce will

00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,940
reduce risk because we humans do

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:22,250
mistakes but we'll release you more time

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,960
to focus on things they are more

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,690
important to your business more

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:31,520
important to your career if I go and ask

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:33,169
you of John and I have were you able to

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,290
learn a little bit about cloud computing

00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:38,000
because you would not respond me I don't

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,060
have time now because I don't have time

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,980
now if automation can make that time if

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:48,290
I ask you about a other example of the

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,679
things you can do with automation is

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,129
item a automated backups automating the

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,800
user requests automating deployments of

00:34:55,129 --> 00:35:00,500
many things you can do it that can make

00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,890
it release a lot of time and reduce risk

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,990
but note this automation do not mean

00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,240
autonomous autonomous in the same

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:11,720
example give it to the car is a car that

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,400
drive itself they have a law using most

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,589
of the automation tools that we have

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,510
there but they go even further in the

00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:19,890
driving itself that means the driver is

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,110
not requiring anymore

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,780
and that's two different things if we

00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:27,690
talk about Oracle database Oracle

00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,600
database 18 C Oracle database 19 C

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,550
Oracle Database 12c they are not

00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,970
autonomous they have plenty of

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:38,550
automation on babbitt on them but

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:42,870
they're not autonomous Oracle had

00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:46,290
autonomous databases autonomous at our

00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:49,200
house ATP and so on that's a transaction

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:52,160
on one they are autonomous but they are

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,020
a hybrid of the Oracle technology plus

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,810
much more automation to make it a fully

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,400
autonomous but they are automation and

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:03,510
autonomous are two different things

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,870
they need to be aware of and make it

00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,540
easy automation amazing human interface

00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:13,200
interaction minimizing manual steps

00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,900
scripting and so on autonomous is a full

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,200
automation with no human interaction

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,040
required at all that's very important

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,860
and again I want to make emphasis of

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,470
cloud is the inevitable next steps in

00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,350
the database architect DNA evolution or

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:34,590
the DBA evolution and you need to be

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:36,570
focused a lot or learn about cloud

00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:40,260
technology especially networking

00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:43,050
security storage and so on that's key

00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,900
and is essential and not only one

00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:49,260
technology go and start learning and

00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:52,800
certify across all the major players in

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:55,440
cloud Auton can go and learn about AWS

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,340
go and learn about Shore go and learn

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,240
about Google going learn about Oracle

00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,240
cloud and so on

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,590
you can see when we talk about cloud if

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,050
you take any manager Magic Quadrant for

00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,880
data management solutions for analytics

00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,849
dents with the party without with

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,369
machine learning and our the business

00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:20,050
intelligence and so on or a quiz the

00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:24,880
leader in that quadrant followed by

00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:27,970
Microsoft AWS teradata and so on if you

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,970
talk about that infrastructure as a

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:33,580
services we will see now that only we

00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:36,490
have three major players right there AWS

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:39,280
Microsoft and Google and we have another

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:42,310
challengers such as Alibaba Oracle IBM

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,950
in infrastructures or services we only

00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,609
have it basically six serious players

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,260
not as you have with bi and analytics

00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:54,070
with data management that we have tons

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:56,380
of many players in the market and you

00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,060
will see a lot more in the database

00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,720
management systems when you have

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:06,760
Microsoft or a Kuei WSS SAP an IBM India

00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:09,849
as leaders on that Magic Quadrant its

00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,609
you will see that when when we talk

00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:17,619
about where most of the work loads are

00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:21,700
running at the moment today versus 2020

00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:27,700
expectations you will see today 37% of

00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:30,220
the workloads running on-premises they

00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,530
were expected that by 2020 the pants

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:36,940
will be only 27% we see laws we have

00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,369
with you having a lot of workload

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,859
on-premises public cloud where

00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:44,980
respectively forty-one percent will be

00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:48,130
by 2020 but today we have a tell you one

00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,230
percent and so on when we compare a very

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,270
similar situations private cloud and a

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,730
hybrid cloud we will see the things

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,520
that's changing and will start changing

00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,910
faster and faster and faster especially

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,910
the current pandemic situation employees

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:06,460
they start working remotely or so on you

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:09,360
will see more things managing to the

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:14,790
Kamui to the cloud engine faster

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:17,010
a public clown challenging you feel

00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:20,310
comparing in the past a lot of people

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:23,310
was talking a lot about okay how is the

00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:26,010
security in the cloud governance in

00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,470
compliancy cloudiness prettiest

00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:31,440
prettiest privacy's birds a lot being a

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,180
locking costs that was the main

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,480
challenges that people were seeing in

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,680
the past today this is the best the

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,540
people don't care too much about

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,420
security because they know the cloud

00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,760
computing companies invest tons of more

00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,610
money then we could do ourselves

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,370
they already fully compliant see for

00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:52,770
governance and compliance they have we

00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:55,440
have tons of cloud as expertise in the

00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:58,260
market any moment primacy is taking very

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,470
seriously especially with GDP our PCI or

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:04,080
many other compliances in the market and

00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,810
the cost is already showing that the

00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:09,170
cost efficient so if that is the best

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,400
now the people is starting to focus off

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:15,710
understanding cause implications of

00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,700
software licenses the licenses rules

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,850
complexities when applying the cloud

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,650
because the license on-premises is not

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,840
the same their license in the cloud that

00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:27,660
means that's starting to be a challenge

00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,850
to understand how it can migrate my

00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,790
current license when I move to the cloud

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:36,990
and things like that you will see that

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:40,140
license is the most challenging a when

00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:47,160
moving to the cloud then companies have

00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:49,470
at the moment when 95% of the workloads

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,750
will be running in the cloud when we're

00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:56,120
asking people about that six percent

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:59,100
think they will be in one year but 20

00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:02,460
percent think they'll be in ten years

00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:06,990
five years twenty seven and so on that

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:10,860
means you will see that the debts will

00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:13,290
not take that long to have 95 percent of

00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,080
the company workloads in the cloud that

00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:18,690
means that show you how little time you

00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,330
have to be preparing these technologies

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,110
to ensure that you have a job in the

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:27,260
future

00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:29,120
and 95% of the respondent of the cloud

00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,840
report from flexural report they are

00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,270
using clothing at the moment we will be

00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,610
seeing the 22 percent are using public

00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,970
cloud only three percent are using

00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:44,120
private cloud only and 69 percent is

00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,610
using hybrid cloud that means you can

00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:50,000
see ninety-one percent of public 72

00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:55,520
percent when they do the crossover with

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:59,660
private again the growing cloud using

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,180
you see that usage of private cloud grow

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,600
is shrinking where the usage of public

00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:09,620
cloud is going up the only the spending

00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:13,010
on cloud is also going up that you will

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:15,740
sing basically everywhere the multiplier

00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:19,550
multi cloud strategy here per year over

00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:22,250
a year is growing more and more the

00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:26,170
enterprise cloud strategy is growing for

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:30,440
companies over a thousand plus employees

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:32,750
when that 58 percent using hybrid cloud

00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:38,810
and basically 84 percent using multi

00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:41,780
cloud and what's next I will say if I

00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:44,840
can give you some tips to improve your

00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:48,400
career as a database administrator or

00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:51,770
now as a database architect would be to

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,640
focus on fields of your skills also as

00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:58,010
change your attitude showing a proper

00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:02,500
attitude and show why you different of

00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:05,720
everybody else will show your your boss

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,690
why you deserve that raise why you

00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,240
deserve the new opportunity or why

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:13,730
you're so critical to the company if you

00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,160
don't show a proper attitude just be one

00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:19,130
of the are the people going with you

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,590
wave that will show the company that

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:25,160
you're not essential and basically you

00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,480
can be easily and replace it and you

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,040
need to learn how to do research

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,870
properly to look for manuals look done

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,690
or look for a other kind of information

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:40,020
available

00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,660
to you I also know how to interact with

00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,730
your peers like in events like

00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,130
conferences you start to doing

00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,260
networking and because the main go when

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,290
you go to that events is for exchanging

00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,960
of knowledge because knowledge is only

00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,849
available when exchange it that means

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,890
you will learn from new speakers you

00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:01,800
will interact and do network you with

00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,980
your peers and you will find people that

00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,730
is already already implemented

00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,410
technologies they are looking to

00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,740
implement then they can give you some

00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,900
tips and also where you can work vice

00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,140
versa in the future it can help other

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,900
people too that know how to do listen

00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:24,990
research is a key process for your

00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:30,300
success please do not go to the to the

00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:32,069
forums and start dropping all your your

00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,200
issues over there and expect people to

00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:36,240
solve them to yourself that show you

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,060
that you had a bad attitude I don't know

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,640
how to do research do not use the same

00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,890
Google to solve our issues and never

00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,109
believe it on everything that was

00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,530
published that you read in the internet

00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:52,290
book so so on why because something that

00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:55,220
happened to me or who worked for me I

00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:58,740
work for anybody else in a book on

00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:01,770
internet work for them but not

00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,930
necessarily we work for you why because

00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:06,869
there's so many variables in the middle

00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:09,210
that could affect the result that the

00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,430
result could be not expected that means

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:15,359
if you want to ensure that something

00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:17,760
really works please apply that solution

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:22,349
in a non production environment please

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,390
and if that works properly then apply in

00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:27,359
your uit and then apply in production

00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:30,480
but do not believe it a hundred percent

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,670
and everything you read or see over told

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:38,069
or you hear without try by yourself

00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:41,859
first also as a key point or success do

00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:46,549
not be afraid to innovate

00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:49,220
innovation is very important and you not

00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:52,490
be afraid to implement technology such

00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:55,759
as machine learning out of a lot of

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:58,039
DevOps automation and so on use it

00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:59,930
because that will show you that you were

00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:02,240
doing a proper attitude they will show

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,759
why you are important to the business

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,269
and finally learn to properly

00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:10,609
communicate most of the time when a user

00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:12,559
come with our issue we stopped listening

00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:14,749
after they start telling what the

00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,660
problem is because we start thinking the

00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:21,440
solution before fully understand the

00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:24,470
issue our Bern Iceland said once if I

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,299
had one hour to solve the to save the

00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:31,099
world I will spend 55 minutes

00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:32,900
understanding the problem and then I

00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:35,299
will use the five minutes to the

00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,759
solution why because when you fully

00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:40,759
understand the problem the solution

00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:42,950
comes like this if you do not understand

00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:44,809
the problem you will start doing the try

00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:47,390
and error trial and error try an error

00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:50,029
because you did not understood the root

00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:51,559
problem properly and with the

00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:54,730
combination with a proper attitude

00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,039
learning to be research being innovative

00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:00,440
know how to properly communicate

00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,269
communicate and listen the that's the

00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,859
main tools they will help you to achieve

00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:08,329
the success in your future and I also

00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:11,059
learn to be proactive

00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:13,730
do not wait promise to become a problem

00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:16,039
to you start working off on you start

00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,359
being proactive and solve them before

00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,210
they become a problem

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,039
that will save a lot of turns of money

00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:25,309
to your company and also time to

00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:28,220
yourself then star is said to be be a

00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,319
fire fighter now you do not be to spend

00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,430
your time putting a fire down and you

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,569
can use that time for something better

00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:37,940
educating prepare yourself for the

00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:41,059
future learn to manage different are

00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:44,779
DBMS technologies like my co Seco Server

00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:47,859
db2 and so on learn about no sequel

00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:52,309
database Cassandra Maria and so on

00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:54,950
how to resolve in available issues is

00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:59,329
acute recovery test to learn

00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:02,480
if your that data is recoverable if your

00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:04,460
backups are useful and document the

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,790
process but though anyone in the company

00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,250
can use it I have a crush to that

00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,990
simulate crashes for Oracle my website

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,569
called crash simulator can play with

00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:17,869
that to ensure the owl is that your

00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:20,599
company RPO and RTOS elas are being

00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:22,579
fulfilled many companies have no idea if

00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:25,130
we did the RPO in RTO are being

00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:28,369
fulfilled for the environments many DBAs

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:30,680
do not even know what they are the SaaS

00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:33,619
for that we're companies we remember our

00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,960
POA recovery point objective and RTO

00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:38,270
recovery time objective that means how

00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,599
much data can you lose in case a

00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:46,250
disaster and how much time can a company

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,200
afford to be down you need to gain deep

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,299
knowledge and performance tuning you

00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,069
need to learn about how the application

00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:56,089
works to know how to interact with your

00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:58,040
database you need to learn how to review

00:48:56,089 --> 00:49:01,069
and implement security efficiently

00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,380
on-premises and in the cloud keep your

00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:07,190
database Trend technology smaller and in

00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:10,059
technologies enology up-to-date learn

00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:13,400
about Kafka micro-services containers

00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:15,440
virtualization and devops by yourself so

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,079
many things you should be looking these

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,069
are only example learn about Python

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:25,220
about a Java learn about cloud

00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:28,010
technology as I mentioned many times so

00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,990
many things you can notice that you

00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,880
should be focused and that's why

00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,190
automation is so important to allow you

00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,819
to have time to focus on these in your

00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:40,549
screen right now some example what's

00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:42,410
next I will tell you - after this

00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:46,460
presentation started looking on tools

00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:49,010
like ansible get lab or get a burger and

00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,650
confluence and also check on our website

00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:54,859
cloud-based the solutions for automation

00:49:51,650 --> 00:50:00,500
framework for help DBAs to automate

00:49:54,859 --> 00:50:03,140
things on their data bases in saying

00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,799
that that's basically what I have to say

00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:08,810
today apologies if I rush a little bit

00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:10,850
with if the topic is a huge

00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:13,520
with a lot of information we could be

00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:16,280
discussing I try to speed up a little

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,640
bit to give us time for a Q&A in case

00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,980
you have any questions and please feel

interesting and we need to make a good

00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:50,330
usage of the business knowledge that we

00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:54,320
have that is or diamond that you need to
