	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,810
hello everybody so today I'm going to

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,990
have a presentation about a topic that

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,150
might be interesting to some of you all

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,139
right so before we go down let's go to a

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,549
data sharing

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,430
sorry not they're sharing screen sharing

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:21,240
so I'm gonna share the keynote thing

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,070
right so today the topic I'm going to

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,680
talk about well maybe share about with

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,359
folks here is actually talk about like

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,949
open source solutions for the big data

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,250
challenges all right now this is the

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,899
theme statement for the presentation so

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,270
in this modern world of business right

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,010
so data management has become the

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,420
crucial critical challenge to overcome

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,570
especially for companies inside the Red

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,300
Sea right so if you do actually invest

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,160
in something called data management

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,399
eventually you might change the company

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,020
space from zero to hero all right so the

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,270
important theme here is actually talking

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,629
about inside this new more than business

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,820
world data is of course everywhere but

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,460
the important things is how to make use

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,560
of it so to make use of it we use a term

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,880
data management all right so we're talk

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,520
about a differences between data

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,320
collection and data management and so on

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,240
and also where are you now

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,130
are you somewhere in the measurement I

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,509
Brian or actually still in the

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,950
collection part one now these are some

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,930
of the genders that we're going to cover

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,729
all right so we'll talk about what's the

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,130
difference between data collection their

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,049
management and if you've got data on him

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,420
what should you do or what can you do of

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,070
course we talk about a constant of

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,890
maintaining the management and it's

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,350
pipeline the process and on and then

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,869
once we got all the things here we

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,689
should free send them right so that's

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,740
when we do storytelling so there's also

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,869
a demonstration here of 10 to roughly 10

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,969
minutes demonstration and I actually

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,579
have videotape that is already so in

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,310
case we do not enough time we can still

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,890
free to presentation and the last thing

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,849
is the FAQ all right question time and

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,860
so on okay so now who's talking so my

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,080
name is Jason I came from the company

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,790
called elastic all right

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,490
my position is actually something for

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,570
educational marketing we-we're right so

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,540
what I do I do

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,390
so daily I do I run trainings I do

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,190
curriculum development all right so the

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,140
trainings are the curriculum for you

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,480
last expect actually is one of the

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,910
contributors in general I do a lot of

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,210
prototyping - so that means simply

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,580
coding sample projects right they're

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,370
useful because I need to pre send these

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,410
prototypes in meetups and also for my

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,360
technical plans so that's why I still do

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,190
a lot of public even though now I'm kind

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,380
of like doing trainings for most of the

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,990
time so the toolbox

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,959
I used to be Java developer writing Java

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,750
back-end systems for a lot of big

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,690
corporates and also solution architect

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,709
those kind of thing all right

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,780
actually System Architect is their

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,209
absolute rocket on anyways pretty much

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,910
the same thing so for the recent years

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,940
actually went I mean kind of a

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,380
translator from bag and developers do

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,120
something what we call dev ops which

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,400
means simply one-man-band

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
you need to finish the bag on the

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,360
front-end the database level or they

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,430
level the cont thing so that's why I

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,690
kind of like shift to go language and

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,400
NIM as the backend back-end development

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,720
language here right because they're fast

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,950
and also native bound right and for the

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,019
front-end I kind of like switch to

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,660
javascript in general so I can see a lot

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,180
of react.js will not angular and so on

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,250
right so if you also get the eastern the

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,780
phone or maybe share these kinds of

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,330
skill sets and you want to kind of have

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,840
discussions with me and so on in three

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,320
two right so for the demonstration and

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,510
the informations here this is the github

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,510
alright so this is the github for the

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,239
the demonstration later on and you get

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,130
all the scripts there as well alright so

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,610
take a look if you have time and you can

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,190
actually take photos etc and also we

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,830
actually have provided a block for the

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,390
this demo as well so even though I'm

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,019
going to do demonstration but if you

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,510
preferred more on reading tax instead of

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,479
watching videos feel free to go to this

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,070
block or medium and for the rest of

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,940
these social media informations if you

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,820
want to connect with me

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,440
always find me on LinkedIn and also if

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,680
you want to get back the source code for

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,440
various projects and related things go

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,130
to the github okay I'm going to use the

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,940
pro master and for medium and WordPress

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,920
yes I write technical blocks and the

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,530
future direction is I'm going to have

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,390
all my blocks migrated to medium so what

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,320
press will kind of like I have nothing

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,990
to do later on

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,430
alright Twitter I saw them go there but

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,320
actually I have an account so that's why

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm still trying to listing that for you

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,410
alright so feel free to take a look on

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,600
those resources now the first thing the

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,400
first agender where are we now are we

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,550
doing data collection or actually doing

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,140
data management to be honest data

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,750
collection simply means getting data

00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,790
from various sources with nearly no

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,920
processing all right so it's just like

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,680
getting the odielocks from windows

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,980
systems and throw it to a repository and

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,840
of course above it should be a kind of

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,000
like system that we can actually search

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,500
and retrieve these information but

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
remember we didn't do any processing

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,810
right so it's just kind of like a

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,000
database you search for particle what it

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,419
long you get it back done nothing else

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,040
so not much value in it all right so

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,590
over time for data management we of

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,350
course will collect the data but we also

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,990
do Processing's on them and later on we

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,830
do data liberalisation which means that

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,540
we will make the data life live so I

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,410
don't we get three Center data in a more

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,500
fancy way interesting way right so this

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,380
means data management is a process a

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,320
step apart one all right so it's very

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,390
different from just collecting them

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,760
so some brainteasers so we've got three

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,680
scenarios what do you think these

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,480
scenarios for a percent is it collection

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,490
will just manage them first one

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,550
collecting locks from different interest

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,890
owns and treat them as all belongs this

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,960
is collection because there is no extra

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,900
value extracted from these leaders are

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,930
collected second one generating trend

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,930
analysis on granted loans to SMEs in

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,180
Singapore this one this is data

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,500
management because we have trend

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,160
analysis is

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,470
just collecting data the number amount

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,460
of money we've granted to assignees but

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,450
also we have a train analysis so we can

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,360
kind of what predict what will happen

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,150
for the next three months or next year

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,590
all right that you added next thing

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,320
discovering the relationship between

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,630
savings and your occupation again this

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,870
is not just collecting but also a data

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:09,090
match because we do analysis and so for

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,010
banks or financial Institute's they

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,140
actually can use this information to

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:16,080
kind of like predict what will happen in

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,270
the economy for the mix water for

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,370
example Co V 19 right we know there are

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,030
lots of business and countries actually

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,220
got locked down and so probably savings

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,740
occupations and the trends and so on

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,960
they might not do well they might be

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,900
flat if we were fortunate they might

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,580
even go a slum alright so these are some

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,770
of the things that we might be able to

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,970
discover it we have the data there all

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,370
right so value added so now what can we

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,320
do with the data on hand there because

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,910
you know a lot of clients from my

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,220
trainings actually have told me that

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,320
yeah well the clients from us is like

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,240
them because there's service providers

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,190
they said the older clients just want us

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,660
to store those locks there and that's a

00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,940
we can do nothing

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,640
oh we have nothing to do alright so in

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,880
general what can we do well usually we

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,340
can do analytics so either by manual way

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,310
that is find an analyst to do this kind

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,060
of an analytical jobs or maybe we can

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,590
find somebody to create a machine

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,780
learning model so that we can learn

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,200
these things without using any human

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,060
inputs all right so two ways of

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,380
analytics one is human or manual

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,229
performed one is machine learning

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,280
performed we can also do a storytelling

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:34,169
base on all these data set we collected

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,860
this is actually important because the

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,450
next step if we can do a storytelling we

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,870
enjoyed a management on decision-making

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,800
as well for example the trend analysis

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,360
on certain things

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,360
can actually help the management you

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,430
have a real idea what is really

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,070
happening inside this business world

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,050
also we can discover the behavior and

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,139
the sticky

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,600
by using regression analysis for example

00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:02,660
when we talk about something like the

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,629
spending related to your celery related

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,160
to your lifting area so actually these

00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,040
things can be done for regression

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,360
analysis right so once we discovered the

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,999
behavior we can kind of like pray some

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,889
Taylor major projects or campaigns to

00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:22,670
focus on that particular group of people

00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:26,749
right so actually it's useful value

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:30,170
added so the cost of maintaining the

00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:31,959
data management the first thing is open

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,769
sauce and the commercial sauce

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,220
commercial sauce data

00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:39,470
I'm sorry not data products so like the

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,470
theme set we're talking about how didn't

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,149
open source projects and software's can

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,699
help to solve the big data challenges

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,730
right so you can see of course open

00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:51,769
source will have a common rival called

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,939
commercial products so you can see you

00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,850
last think is somewhere here in the

00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:58,699
middle so is actually kind of like free

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,550
and not free so if you actually just

00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:03,740
don't need the support from

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:07,279
elasticsearch the company you can use

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,500
elastic stack for free okay but usually

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,839
you buy the support if you're actually

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,059
running the last stack in a production

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,129
environment I guess right so that's why

00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:18,559
I will say it's a yes on yes in no

00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:21,110
scenario so it's an open source product

00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,540
but you can also make it commercial if

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,089
you buy the subscriptions right so

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,860
similar things happens in the field as

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,410
well so you can see web Splunk that is a

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,079
completely commercial product it works

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,589
very similar to elastic stack in general

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,209
Oracle has his own Suites to handle the

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,329
data management processes

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:44,300
and solutions etc lock return data are

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,029
very similar to elastic as well and they

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,670
are actually fast as a yes

00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:51,709
so it's kind of like software as a

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,290
service or software as a platform as a

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:56,860
service those kind of things all right

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,480
how do it's also one of the yes and no

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,089
scenario so it's open source for sure

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,759
but for production environment you

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:08,230
probably would buy the license and make

00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:12,199
it commercial right so same case

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,329
this is the variations the options you

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:18,560
can get to manage a data management

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:21,639
system now the myths lots of myths

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,440
alright we see that open source is crap

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,860
that's not true alright so for example

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,540
we have a lot of very nice open source

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,430
projects for example how do is that you

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,010
want them elasticsearch is one of them

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,649
Kafka is also one of them and so on so

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,589
there are lots of their well produced it

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,449
open source products and to be honest

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,660
even though you might think that Owen

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:47,600
sauce is not kind about reliable many

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,579
banking many banks and financial

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
institutions they even government's are

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:56,060
actually using open source products at

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,949
their back-end so it's true so well I

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,170
can't disclose the name though but you

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:02,000
can see in Singapore some of the banks

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,459
the bigger ones are already using

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,220
elastic stacked at the back and also

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:11,449
some of the some of the commercial

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,889
products like the what did something

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:15,529
symbol to uber right so we have

00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:17,870
something similar uber in in Singapore

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,910
like oh crap and so on so these guys

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,709
companies also make use of elastic

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,240
search for searching and also for

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:28,069
geolocation relate the search all right

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,920
so that's the case so the sauce is not

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:34,250
really crap it depends on how the owner

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,930
of the product or project runs this this

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,610
thing all right so it's just like the

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,889
measure products commercial products

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,959
also have crap things so it depends on

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:44,930
how that company is going to run that

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,910
project or product all right so that's

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,000
why it's a myth all right no such thing

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,100
as open source must be crap right so

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,980
support is limited on the open source

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,630
products again it's a myth and if you're

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,089
looking to you loss at search right we

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,910
have very good documentation for the

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:05,870
public so this is also kind of support

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,279
and also if you actually don't want to

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,850
buy support and you still want to get

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,380
consultation for free we well I mean for

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,870
elastic search itself we already

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,310
maintained a forum for doing so so you

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,430
can always produce your questions there

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,690
and the developers engineers and also

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,490
the support

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,470
team will actually take a look at that

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,580
and give you some directions so of

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,340
course it's not hundred percent

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,660
guarantee that you get what you want but

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,850
at least we give you directions on how

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,220
to solve the problem remember is free

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,670
from home all right so no guarantee on

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,140
some of the things of course ok the next

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,870
myth a team of hundred versus the

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,450
collaborations of talyn's so people will

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,080
say that commercial products are better

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,270
because we're 100 smart brains working

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,970
on that particular commercial product

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,940
well that is a true and false thing

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,770
again so think about this way for open

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,560
source like elasticsearch we have so

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:05,870
many contributors from the public so all

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:08,240
the thousands of contributors if if 50%

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,120
of those thousands of contributors are

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,760
also smart brains just like those team

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,330
of hundreds then probably I can tell you

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,730
that actually the quality the idea the

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:23,240
capability of those open source projects

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,400
is not worse than a team of hundred

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,600
actually it should be much better all

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,480
right something about this way if you

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,060
work in a company so your ideas or

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,300
imaginations will be kind of like bound

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,190
by the company structure and manage them

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,350
before when sauce we're actually very

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,990
open spirit so if you have something

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,330
good something fancy some good ideas

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,910
feel free to contribute and maybe

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,250
discuss with the group of people

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,470
maintaining this open source project so

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,600
if your idea is actually a good one

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,470
adopted hey you actually just

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,110
contributed a new feature right so this

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,570
is a myth right no such thing as 100

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,940
brains must be better than the talons

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,520
and the poplar and also so many talents

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,470
inside this computing world so that's

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,089
why it's a myth right the last point the

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,630
OMA sauce company behinds not stable

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,680
before or after the IPO now this

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,000
interesting thing because the

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,910
elasticsearch actually gone through this

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,360
all right we just IPO like last year I

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,150
guess last year or last year-and-a-half

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,430
interesting thing is before went to go

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,470
to IPO and some of the markets will feel

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,120
that the company's not stable maybe

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,280
tomorrow they will collapse and so on so

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,520
that is the reason why they don't want

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,950
it

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,260
my license as hell phone actually is a

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,660
myth because it really depends on how

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,420
the owner of the project the company

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,000
actually runs this this company alright

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:50,000
if the runs this company well like what

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,220
we did actually before after IPO is the

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,070
same we're still very stable we still

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,170
have a lot of support to the users that

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,030
have talked about product right so

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,740
that's why it's a myth and on the other

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,470
hand commercial companies like also go

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,270
into IPO might also collapse right so

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,070
there's no guarantee that if you are

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,320
trying to buy a public company you will

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,050
always be so set so no such thing so

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,320
that's why it's a myth all right so the

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,910
cost of your data management team the

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,080
first thing is you need to have a team

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,670
of people to handle these five things so

00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,830
we need a team of people that can

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,690
integrate data sauce into our data

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,000
management system because the data

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,800
source may be from database let me talk

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,970
of it from api's or from just CSV files

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,550
the next thing is we need a team of

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,980
people to do some process and cleaning

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,170
cleansing of data because the data you

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,360
get back might be not in a uniformed

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,940
format so we need to kind of like um

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,890
like for exam we got CSV you got XML

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,590
dataset we did convert them into a

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,750
format that is acceptable by your data

00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,790
management system so you need a team of

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,400
people to do that next thing is to apply

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,080
the analytics either a manual weight or

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,720
the machine learning way so again you

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,390
need people to program these things

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,030
beforehand next thing is how to generate

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,270
visualizations on storytelling if you're

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,670
not have a tool to do that you need a

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,890
programmer to code the visualizations

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,589
like for example using graphical Jas

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,690
Raffles of Jas and so on or maybe you

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:23,209
have mr. reports you need somebody to

00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,820
create a report right so this is the

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,920
case of visualization thing and of

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,050
course last coin is how to house keep

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,580
your data alright so over there you need

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:36,230
a house keep them you need an archive

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,180
backup and so on so he s a good to stack

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,780
would actually reduce all these costs

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,780
mentioned

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,500
the process pipeline so you can see

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,389
actually is the previous five steps we

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,450
do the integration we do the cleansing

00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:54,750
we do analysis we generate reports and

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,970
of course how skip so each of the steps

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,610
how can we fulfilled it in for example

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,380
you lost an inelastic stack the first

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,919
step is talking about something what we

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,990
call collecting an integrating data so

00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,350
in this case we use a lot stash which is

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,210
an ETL - so see we can actually have

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,490
input from different sources like from

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,500
standing in and then would pump the data

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,120
into a filter transformer so that when

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,880
transport them by using like prop

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,450
replicas pression I think some data from

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,970
GIPS and extract a browser agent data

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,250
from user agent parking and so on and

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,380
finally we output the data to somewhere

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,710
maybe elasticsearch or just a flat file

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,419
all right so that is how we handle step

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,980
1 if you're using it.also stuff of

00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,570
course if you're using some other

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,639
products there might be something

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:46,919
similar as well step 2 the cleansing

00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:50,490
multiple approaches so we can use it use

00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:53,070
a program to do the cleaning before hand

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,360
you can use tools like Globes - that we

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,309
just mentioned earlier to do the

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,070
cleansing or maybe you use some

00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,049
server-side products do that like for

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,149
example you last search have ingest note

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,769
which is something that we can create a

00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:07,679
ninja's pipeline alright so this is the

00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,510
pipeline find out like a script and so

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,919
every document that comes in will go

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:15,899
through this script and do a cleansing

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:18,779
operation right step free the analysis

00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:21,210
so remember analysis can be done through

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,220
manually or machine learning level so

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,200
for you lost the stack we provide kibana

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,029
and machine learning tools here like for

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,600
example this is actually a to call

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:34,080
machine learning inside the Cabana so we

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,539
can use this to or app to actually find

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,970
out the trend analysis and also some are

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,620
not abnormal activities where some of

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,620
the red ones here means that at this

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:48,510
moment time these things actually

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:50,159
abnormal right step four we talked about

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,309
data liberalisation through the

00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,110
visualizations so usually we need a bi

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,820
to for that and you can

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,580
pay for it or you can use the open

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,790
source version so this is the keep on a

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,970
dashboard that we provided totally free

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,000
okay

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:09,020
yes tulip tree so of course a freebie I

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,549
too would not be 100% super useful

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,299
sometimes right but it's actually

00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:16,799
already feature reached right and the

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,260
interesting thing is there will be some

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,020
limitations for sure because we're not

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,309
hundred percent working on this kind of

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,650
visualization platform

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:27,570
we're not like companies like Ravana or

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,000
tableau in which they actually focus

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,320
hundred-percent on visualization so of

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,110
course in some ways we have some

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,580
limitations right compared with them in

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,040
commercial products you will have more

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,110
support on the visualization types and

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,570
also able to integrate two different

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,100
data sources as well but to be honest if

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,500
you actually do you don't want to pay

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,929
and open source products like keep on it

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:54,210
and also the loss of stack is actually

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:56,520
quite good enough right picturised step

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,990
5 is housekeeping so again lots of ways

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,210
alright um when we talk about

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,190
housekeeping is my archiving data backup

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,280
thing data and we store the data

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,190
expected those bad things so many ways

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,780
so elastic stack provides basically

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,210
something called index lifecycle

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,090
management so we can create policy so

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,400
that we know the index the index when

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,890
they are old enough we will clean the

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,200
flood of to life I thing and maybe

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,600
backup and so on so another way is to

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,700
use the Creator Python client which is

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,100
actually doing the same thing but you

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,799
need to kind of want use some cron jobs

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:36,299
to kind of wet regularly run these from

00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:38,340
these tasks right storytelling so why is

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,160
it important for storytelling because

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,320
you want to retrieve the hidden values

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,290
inside your dataset right you've got so

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,210
many data but it's very boring to just

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,179
present them in spreadsheets right so

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:54,840
instead you need something more vivid a

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:57,720
graph or inter inter activities all

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,370
right the fun thing and also the second

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,280
big point data collected from customers

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:05,160
revealed their behavior truth so those

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:09,060
there's no way to lie so thing about

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,830
this way if I'm giving you a survey now

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,870
asking you a question did you buy

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,870
something for your wife within this year

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,610
like perfumes and so on then what you do

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,770
is like you're scratching your head is

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,720
trying to recall from your memory did I

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,890
actually buy something for my wife well

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,220
if you did good

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,080
if you did it haha in big trouble

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,060
alright so you're trying to kind of like

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,980
retrieve the memory so you know

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,810
sometimes when we retrieve the memory is

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,030
not hundred percent accurate so you

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,190
might say yes I did actually you did it

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:41,100
right or maybe the other way the other

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,440
way round so now the case is if we

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,090
actually dump back all the data from

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,040
your mind behavior for example I'm

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,750
working a bang I get back all your

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,180
credit card transactions right

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,400
throughout this year I can actually do a

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,140
filtering and find out oh you actually

00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,010
bought something that is related to

00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,300
females be set up for male then probably

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,940
they are related to your wife

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,070
maybe all right so that means there's no

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,500
way to lie even though through your

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,910
memory the main memory you said that you

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,310
didn't buy anything but actually we

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,650
found out that you did buy something all

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:16,260
right so that is the point here so based

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,750
on the truth data side we get we can

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,550
actually predict the sales or do some

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,250
campaigns related to a particular group

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:28,380
much more accurately all right because

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,060
these are the true data all right now

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,550
the next thing is storytelling or

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:35,490
storyteller is it a good job so these

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,920
are some interesting attacks are done if

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,560
you go to indeed or maybe job Street

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,690
comm just type in storyteller and you'll

00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,880
see here you actually got back quite a

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,440
number of jobs as well right so that

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,470
means storytelling is actually not too

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,900
bad and also a lot of fun non-technical

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,640
users like business analysts and so on

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,980
or maybe product managers or project

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,710
managers they're actually also

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,000
storytellers right so how does tell a

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:04,920
story nicely if you actually have the

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,070
data presented in the correct way of

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,980
course it's better to tell the story if

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,770
not for example you only got Excel

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,330
spreadsheet Vermont is so boring even

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,300
though you can tell the story very

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,730
vividly it's still boring but on a

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,340
visualization part if you provide the

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,820
same thing here with

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:28,789
what this to be honest it's much more

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,230
better right it's not so boring and you

00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:31,820
can even Hoover on it I have some

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,279
interactivity Wow

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,960
that's a plus alright so even though you

00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,450
have to technique you still need tools

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,289
to assist you to make the story better

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:44,809
alright so that's the point so want to

00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:47,419
learn more if you're actually want to

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,100
learn more about the elastic stack so

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,320
today the demonstration we're talking

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,909
about the exact stack here so we're

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,260
talking about how to use file piece to

00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:56,330
ingest the data and then go to the

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,909
elastic search and finally go to keep on

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,890
it to visualize the thing you can

00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,440
actually take a look on this link

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,090
training the elastic Co and then you

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,580
will see that we have a lot of trainings

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,649
talking about how to use all the tools

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,070
within the elastic stack including

00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:14,570
machine learning as well you also can

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,220
pay attention to something called

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,520
certified engineers so you need to take

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:22,220
an exam and you've got certified in u.s.

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,070
in the States certified engineers

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,039
actually got a better job that's true

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:31,100
but for Asia not a big trend yet but

00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:34,340
it's true that if you actually have a

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,860
certified certified certification

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,799
granted or earned it actually you should

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,149
get a job easier plus also having some

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,460
bargaining powers on getting a better

00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:45,409
salary

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,419
so again recapped on the resources of

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:50,240
the demonstration these are the links

00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:53,090
that we get back that actually supports

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,880
the demonstration later on Plus also the

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,029
block version and also the social media

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,669
that you can kind of like pain be on and
