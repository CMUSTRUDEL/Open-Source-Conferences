The current excitement around Bitcoin as "decentralised crypto money" has left us in a state where some of the fundamental ideas behind it -namely anonymous p2p economic exchange, technoactivism to re-enfranchise people from the centralised control of fiat currencies and other ideas loosely referred to as "crypto anarchism" are being fast forgotten.

Not only has bitcoin (and its contemporaries) become defacto stores of perceived economic value rather than a medium for its exchange, of recent times a large-scale shift is taking place in the (computational) power balance which determines control over its network. This shift is concurrent with efforts to de-anonymise pseudonymous identities transacting on the public ledger and legally regulate (AKA Tax) cryptocurrency transactions.

i afternoon everyone

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,639
sorry for the delay I was slightly

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:14,420
technologically challenged my hardware's

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,420
a bit old for the projector system here

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:23,970
so this might have come across as a

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,980
slightly odd oddly title of talk so to

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,300
give you a bit of background I'm the

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,369
Jester and the court my favorite

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,980
comedian is one of my favorite comedians

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,790
is John Oliver who's a very popular and

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,719
controversial commentator on US and

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:47,270
other world politics and if you can sort

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:52,820
of see my talk in that light it might be

00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,820
hopefully mildly enjoyable anyway so

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:05,220
from the title obviously there's a few

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:07,380
complex words and there I'm sort of

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,930
assuming that most people here have been

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,180
following cryptocurrency and/or the

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,380
blockchain and have some context about

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,009
the background from which the blockchain

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,430
and cryptocurrency arose there's a lot

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:27,090
of body of work that preceded what we

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,490
today know as the blockchain so I want

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,979
to kind of touch upon a few points here

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,140
and there and if it doesn't make sense I

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,530
hope in the beginning hopefully it will

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,530
eventually so let's start with anarchy

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,710
this is arguably the picture that comes

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,430
into most people's minds when we think

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,710
about the word anarchy you know there's

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,580
some sort of violence and loss of

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,970
control in government and you know this

00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,880
is the public image of anarchy this is a

00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,740
terrifying thought for most of the

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,350
general public and I've used to work

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,470
there but you can read yourself slightly

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,870
derogate tree but in general this is the

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:17,930
public understanding of the effects of

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:23,360
anarchy and bitcoin came out of a sort

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:28,489
of software developers anarchic world it

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:33,739
came from you know world of software not

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:35,360
kists this is what governments see it's

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,910
terrifying Anarchy's terrifying for

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,739
governments it's the individual that

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,420
wants to challenge authority and do

00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:46,880
their own thing very terrifying this is

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,790
what cooperation see now interesting I

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,890
couldn't find a public domain picture

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,280
anywhere online so you'll have to go and

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,010
do the googling or DuckDuckGo in

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,790
yourself to find the image but basically

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:05,120
if you can imagine Nicolas Cage in his

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,040
role as the URI or all love you know if

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,110
there's anarchy then I can sell a lot of

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,799
weapons you know and make a lot of money

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,890
out of it this is what corporations see

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,420
and obviously if you've heard about the

00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,890
paperclip Maximizer that's what a

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,810
corporation is supposed to do it's

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,760
supposed to maximize profits for its

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,190
shareholders if it doesn't doing that

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:33,950
then it's not doing its job properly

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:35,989
it's an AI so moving on this is what

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:39,260
anarchists see themselves as actually

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,239
it's not threatening at all I've got

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,680
this public domain picture for online

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,420
this is a completely random picture I

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,980
don't know the person involved but

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,150
essentially they you know they put

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,530
across the idea the most accurately as

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,680
far as I could tell

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,370
and the basic fundamental idea of hainan

00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,280
our key is sovereignty over your own

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,650
mind your own consciousness there's no

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,080
implication for other people or for

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,670
other systems or for the world and

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,550
essentially a crypto narc it's comes

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:15,470
from this perspective I want to be able

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:17,840
to control the way I do commerce with

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,470
other people trade with other people and

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,720
crypt you know cryptography is the means

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,030
by which I can you know that I I know

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,510
software this is what I do and so this

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:34,669
is the tool with which I'm going to

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:39,190
implement this idea what is crypto well

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:39,190
I'm sure you've all watched the famous

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,650
technology-based movie I won't name

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,810
which one it is but this is the idea of

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,639
some really complex stuff just like

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:56,870
scrolling down your screen it's all

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:59,690
cryptic this is the idea of a something

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:05,540
really complicated we in everyday

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:07,990
parlance this is what a computer

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,910
scientist would see cryptography as

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,910
don't know if many of you have heard of

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,410
the computer science idea of complexity

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:23,410
and the big ol notation but essentially

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:32,800
cryptography is to put it in really

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:40,240
oversimplified terms it is to weaponize

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:43,820
a computational complexity in a way that

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,530
is advantageous to the program so or to

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,150
the person who does the algorithm and

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,910
and the best way to illustrate this is

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,820
the one-way hashing function so it's

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,919
easy to calculate the result going in

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,100
one direction and you get an answer

00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,750
which is essentially a hash but it's

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,140
really difficult to go the other way so

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,610
if you're given a and you take you run

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,340
it through one-way hashing function

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:11,180
then you get B or is it X and Z I don't

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,860
know anyway and then and that's easy and

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,189
it happens very quickly and the

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:20,680
algorithm makes sure that calculating be

00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:24,259
from a happens and in order one

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,389
complexity but going the other way

00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,580
around is extremely difficult so you'll

00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,580
have to really crunch it through brute

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,139
force and that and the function is

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,210
designed mathematically to make sure

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,830
that this happens and so this is what I

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:42,439
mean by weaponizing complexity and so

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,529
people figured out how to put together

00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,319
these algorithms and then arrange them

00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:50,689
in interesting ways and so if you follow

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,129
the blockchain technology you'll hear

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:54,669
things like the Merkle tree in the bloom

00:06:52,129 --> 00:07:00,409
filter and stuff like that and

00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:05,840
essentially these are putting together

00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:07,430
these basic ideas of crypto into more

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,370
interesting data structures where you

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,159
could for example search through large

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,029
pots large volumes of data with a

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:19,759
specific question mind which is is this

00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:23,240
key that I'm searching for part of the

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,610
set that I'm looking for or not and the

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,120
bloom filter for example would

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:31,550
definitely tell you no but maybe yes so

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,129
there are a few mathematical ideas but

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,300
what I'm throwing out here is basically

00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:38,270
trying to kind of give some context

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,120
about the word crypto all right

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,550
currency controversial again but we'll

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,490
have to step out of the world of

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:54,680
software and move into the world of

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:57,500
political economy in the 80s when hash

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,310
cash and he gold and all these things

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:05,120
were going on with the world had gone

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,610
through a period where global economics

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,159
have basically disappointed people with

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:15,739
any sense of what money is if you look

00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:18,049
at the 30s the phenomenal sort of

00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:21,199
big event that happened in economics was

00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:22,969
that Franklin Roosevelt basically banned

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,849
private ownership of gold you'd have to

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:30,099
have license in America too only in the

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:34,999
United States of America to own gold

00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:40,099
privately and what this meant was by the

00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:42,409
40s the United States government was

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:47,120
basically the largest gold owner in the

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:49,389
entire world and people who had been

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,430
used to trading with gold understood

00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,899
what this meant with gold you could

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,540
trade with anybody like people

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,089
instinctively understood what gold was

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,939
as a value exchange so you give me 10

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,829
cows and I give you so much gold you

00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:06,170
know and there are these biblical

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:07,790
stories and so on historical stories of

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,339
people carrying around you know metal

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,149
coins you know and this is where coinage

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:17,949
came from and now this was gone it was

00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:20,809
illegal to hold gold and there were

00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:22,910
justifiable reasons as a politician in a

00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,680
democratic country obviously FDR could

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,899
not write his personal writ it was

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,550
obviously you know based on a series of

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,879
economic events that happened but didn't

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,160
you know de facto this is what happened

00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,550
and post-world war you've got a

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,149
situation where the only exchangeable

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:44,509
commodity with the three properties that

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:48,350
real money should hold were embodied in

00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:51,350
gold in the US held control of more than

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:55,970
50% of that commodity and so they

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:58,250
basically helped come come across with

00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,839
this global currency exchange system

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,350
called the Bretton Woods agreements

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:07,339
where people actually agreed to the US

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:11,329
dollar being it's a global sort of

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:13,129
currency of exchange but you know people

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,290
are not full so they wouldn't come they

00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:17,470
wouldn't agree to this either without

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,220
sufficient amounts of coercion or

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:24,559
sufficient amounts of greed and

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,550
obviously the fact that the US

00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,980
government had

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,860
50% of the gold was a you know a large

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:36,949
part of why this was you know this was

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:40,189
to be pulled off and come 1971 Richard

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:42,819
Nixon basically said so the Bretton

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:45,379
Woods Agreement was basically a

00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:47,089
situation where any country could go to

00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,259
the US government and say oh look I've

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,179
got a hundred million dollars I want

00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:51,860
gold worth a hundred million dollars and

00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,240
the agreement said that the US

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,339
government would have to actually give

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,889
them physical gold in exchange for the

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,319
hundred million dollars and in 71 Nixon

00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,660
said sorry we're not going to give you

00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:04,459
any more gold you can you know get lost

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,170
we're just going to say that a dollar is

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:09,860
a dollar and that's it that's whatever

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:13,279
we decided is and this this is basically

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,189
known as the Nixon shock so what's the

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,850
situation now globally basically

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:22,879
government's print paper money and they

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,499
play games with it and this is a

00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,959
situation in which crypto currency was

00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:31,670
born if you look at the original email

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:36,410
by the person allegedly known as Satoshi

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:43,029
Nakamoto he talks about let's go there

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:46,459
he talks about sorry I sort of have to

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:48,860
switch slides here but he talks about so

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:50,839
this is from his original paper the

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,639
Bitcoin paper and he says commerce on

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,649
the internet has come to rely almost

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,929
exclusively on financial institutions

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,059
serving as a trusted third parties to

00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:02,329
process electronic payments so it's

00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:05,410
coming from a very anarchist perspective

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:09,920
it's coming from this perspective that

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:16,029
we don't have control over you know what

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,029
we use as currency and so oops

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:23,290
and so what what the tech community

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,730
those sort of crypto and archives tech

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,540
community did was they said okay well

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,990
we're going to put all this stuff

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:33,430
together we're going to put software and

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:37,240
crypto and the internet together and use

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:39,460
our weaponized beagle and the innovative

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,500
thing that today we know if that's the

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:47,620
public blockchain to create this trusted

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,230
third party and what does the trusted

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,550
third party algorithm look like if you

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,890
want to understand how the blockchain

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,240
really works as a trust mechanism you

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,850
have to go back to LAN port Leslie

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:02,350
Lamport who is a pioneer in distributed

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:05,850
systems and this is a paper from 1986 I

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:09,160
called the Byzantine generals problem

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:13,060
where the problem of consensus now when

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,770
we talk about consensus we mean you know

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,790
if you have multiple people who do not

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:22,150
trust each other completely or at all

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,920
rather what does it take for them to

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,690
collectively be able to agree on

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,490
something

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:31,990
and basically it boiled down to the

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,080
problem that is illustrated in this

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:38,290
diagram which is the problem of that of

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:42,280
one person in a three-person situation

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,950
giving an order to two people to agree

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,640
to attack or not basically in the

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,850
Byzantine generals problem and it turns

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,990
out that in order for the group of three

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:59,560
to actually agree completely in

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:03,430
consensus you need to have at least two

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:08,530
n plus one so at least two-thirds of the

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:10,570
people trying to do consensus need to

00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,480
agree that you know agree in whatever

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:17,140
that is that they are agreeing on and so

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,540
this idea basically means that for

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,230
example on the on the blockchain

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,450
if you have less than a third sorry more

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,010
than a third of people deciding that

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,180
they don't want to talk the gossip

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,980
protocol and they want to do their own

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,480
thing

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:38,080
the blockchain is in trouble

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:43,450
and why do I say that well I just pulled

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:46,210
this off the Bitcoin blockchain dalian

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:49,570
for pools website this is the

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:55,120
distribution of mining pools for

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:57,160
blockchain in the world and if you look

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,300
at this distribution you'll see that

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,270
there's a lot of labels distributed

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,270
around and then there's like this very

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:10,300
you know were very visible highlight in

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,160
red that says a large portion of unknown

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,540
blocks does not mean an attack on the

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,680
network it simply means that we have

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,090
been unable to determine the origin so

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,400
why is it that if you look at the

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,590
unknown percentages nine percent it's

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,010
not even thirty percent it's not you

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:30,940
know you need to have at least 33 or 34

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,560
percent for our argument's sake uh you

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,030
know of the participants of the

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,690
blockchain network to mount an attack

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:42,070
well why is it that you know this is

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:46,440
very visibly you know put on the on on

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,390
the web on the web page right so it says

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,100
you know we're unable to determine the

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,330
origin and it seems to be something that

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,190
needs to be clarified well the reason

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,860
for that is that there is an unwritten

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,390
consensus which is the consensus of the

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,210
trust network which is human it's

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,590
completely outside of the algorithm you

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,480
know you know the mining pools you know

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,180
you know who the people are only

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,010
involved are or at least you have some

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,300
sense of what they stand for and what

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,640
they're you know what's in it for them

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,110
and the unknown is terrifying is the

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,310
unknown is terrifying in the same way

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,800
that the unknown is terrifying for a

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:27,640
government I hope you can see the

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:31,300
parallels here so you know this brings

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:35,760
us to the what I call it the Trojan

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:38,440
horse narrative which is

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,130
and going back to nakamoto's original

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,020
quote where he he recognized us as

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,180
obviously he invented the thing so he

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,770
recognized he says the system is secure

00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,960
as long as honest modes collectively

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,000
control more cpu power than any

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,590
cooperating group of attacker knows

00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,250
right so so we're in a situation where

00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:02,380
you know everybody knows that as long as

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,060
so this is not about individuals this is

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,640
not about miners who are individuals

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:11,260
this is about miners who are computers

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:15,370
and as long as the cooperating group

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,570
that agrees on on the consensus controls

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:22,050
the largest amount of CPU power then

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,400
everything's all right and the

00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:28,170
blockchain algorithm for Bitcoin

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,030
specifically in this case would be safe

00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:35,230
but really is that than there is is that

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:38,290
the narrative you know the this is a I

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,890
mean anybody would common sense knows

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:43,750
that you know that this is a given and

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:49,870
it's mathematically proven by a Lamport

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,260
um I would contend that the real Trojan

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:56,590
horse

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:59,140
is an idea which spans across more

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:02,560
things than just cryptocurrency I would

00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:05,200
contend that the real Trojan horse is

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,490
his idea of technology optimism and if

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,990
you look it up you'll find some really

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:15,370
interesting things there's a brilliant

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:16,420
there's a brilliant documentary by Adam

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,490
Curtis and it's called hyper

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:27,280
normalization in which he talks about

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:30,390
this narrative where essentially these

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:36,700
entities more or less in a broad

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:38,470
grouping are sort of enforcing a fake

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,240
neurotic what's today known as fake news

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,040
I mean it's very popular now but

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,840
actually there is a there is a strong

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,540
discourse which which disconnects the

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,400
public from the reality of

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,590
so if you I mean I'm you know I've been

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,990
to different countries with very drastic

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,490
political systems I've you know I've

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,260
lived and taught in North Korea for

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,210
example and then when I step out of

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,530
North Korea into the real world my mind

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,600
is boggled by the amount of propaganda

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,860
actually that's hitting me when I you

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,290
know step into the Western world and

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,850
vice versa so you know it's you know

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,520
when you win a fish in water you don't

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:19,130
really realize that you you know you are

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,480
in water but when we know so what I'm

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,710
trying to say is that that you know

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:32,030
there is this situation where that's

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:36,830
okay it's normal and this idea of techno

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:40,360
- pian ism is I have a hypothesis that

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,860
this idea of technology realism is now

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,640
sort of getting into the world of

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,470
economics and sort of driving the

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,230
narratives that the blockchain is useful

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,540
for everything the blockchain you know

00:19:51,230 --> 00:20:03,860
is that hammer for which every problem

00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:06,560
is a nail thank you I have a little plug

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,650
this is a ten dollar device called the

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,020
Adafruit it's an NFC reader

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:15,080
unfortunately I wasn't able to

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:17,750
demonstrate it but it reads NFC cards

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,700
and if you've used two Visa payWave I

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,870
read my card today it's really

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,430
interesting to see what information

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:26,900
comes out of it and I actually went to

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:29,060
and stuck some of these with a Raspberry

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:33,350
Pi under your chairs so no no I'm

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:37,430
kidding but if you want to have a go and

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:40,370
read your card I'm happy to you know

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,230
display to you what your NFC readable

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,430
card

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,290
you know holds information but I was

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,480
very interesting I did not invent this

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,250
friend in a friend of mine put it

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,250
together Tabish and we're gonna actually

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,190
showcase this at hail hacks and hack

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,720
which is my you know the organized

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,990
whatever the communities that I

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,510
represent as Asia we're going to have a

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,010
go at this properly there'll be a

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,640
they're more than welcome to come that's

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:12,250
my plug hell hacks oh this is an

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,250
Adafruit a DAF Ruit

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:32,669
and what I'm saying is that the the

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,080
narrative that the blockchain is

00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:38,230
independent so that the technology can

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,510
create the neutrality required in

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,960
commerce is a false they so false

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,960
narrative

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,700
I'm saying neither I'm saying that the

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,380
the whole you know the whole idea behind

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,340
the blockchain is that you're applying

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,110
technology to a so to a human problem

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,340
and so you're so for example the the

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:14,150
newer narratives of having AI drive you

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:17,590
know the trust issues in in blockchain

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:21,470
networks for example is again sort of

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,920
giving up human control in that system

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:29,650
and allowing the technology to look

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,650
after issues like trust for example

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,909
for a techno libertarian right

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,460
but I see that

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,590
the issue of where your consensus comes

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,050
from and what are placing trust in and

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,090
the question is 10 technologies support

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,950
mechanisms work actually knowing that

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,760
you need to trust is the code and now

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:59,900
the answer is yes then smart contracts

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,400
and such they I prefer the word for the

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900
lender than watching and wanting to the

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,740
solution for what a good religious

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:09,640
rights and everything but logic to

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,340
actually execute contracts

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,530
correct man there are places 80% of what

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,570
the nation-state does worse and that's

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,549
so using a voluntary to make mr.

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,309
prohaszka mechanism is something for

00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,480
everyone I guess the pressure the

00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:25,450
government should be afraid of this

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,930
president rather than exposing their

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:32,220
team supporting how is it

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,220
continue to be a volunteer

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,600
you're assuming is the major application

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,980
of commissioners commerce and I'm

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,890
telling you that they flying around

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,880
right I think for materials artists

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,850
become voluntary wait wait if you were

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,630
to do it

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,980
because of information system Elementary

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,570
nobody's pointing a gun to your head and

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,960
saying you have to invent

00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:01,779
whatever create your own branch any one

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,340
time in theory except that you leave

00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:17,229
except that you need to have the

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:20,289
resources which are expensive well yeah

00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:24,429
I mean so that you know that boils down

00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:27,609
to again trust network so you have this

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,859
narrative that was built upon the sort

00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:33,359
of you know you can have the absolutely

00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:35,710
perfect anonymous you know

00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:39,190
individualistic existence which is the

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:42,999
crypto anarchist dream and then you have

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,989
this sort of that there's sort of this

00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:48,070
this the realities that are slipping in

00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:49,899
which is that trust networks are

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,429
actually creeping in and the people that

00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:52,570
are participating and calling the shots

00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,759
in those trust networks and not

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,479
necessarily the end users who are

00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:00,290
promised this script or an RP stream

00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:06,620
exactly

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:08,030
I really look forward to that thank you

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:21,530
I think I've run out of time oh that's

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:26,510
one more yeah in the general that the

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:28,250
first 5,000 years with yes absolutely

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,400
brilliant yeah I'll try and pop that in

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:34,900
there in a later presentation if I do

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,900
this later on thank you Thanks

00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:44,439
