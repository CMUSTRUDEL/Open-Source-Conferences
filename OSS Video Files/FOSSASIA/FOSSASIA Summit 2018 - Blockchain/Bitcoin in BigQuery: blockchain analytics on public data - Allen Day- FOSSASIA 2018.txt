Cryptocurrencies have captured the imagination of technologists, financiers, and economists. Perhaps even more intriguing are the long-term, diverse applications of the blockchain. By increasing transparency of cryptocurrency systems, the contained data becomes more accessible and useful.The Bitcoin blockchain data are now available for exploration with BigQuery. All historical data are in the big query-public-data:bitcoin_blockchain dataset, which updates every 10 minutes. We hope that by making the data more transparent, users of the data can gain a deeper understanding of how cryptocurrency systems function and how they might best be used for the benefit of society.
