	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,140
so welcome to the

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,340
awesome thank you so much hello everyone

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,090
can you all hear me okay and the in the

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,400
back does this work so my name is Darren

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,039
Frankel I work at Enterprise blockchain

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,100
what that means is I work to partner and

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,539
consult with large enterprises on

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,840
developing blockchain based solutions so

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,790
to supplement their businesses I work

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
with governments I work with regulators

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,960
I work with private entities and so what

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,489
I want to talk to you today is a little

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,219
bit about kind of what I do in this

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,420
space but the the biggest thing I want

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,100
to actually talk about today is the need

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,840
for talent and why I want people to

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,610
start thinking beyond cryptocurrencies

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,610
and so

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,589
when people think of blockchain what and

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,479
most people think of so most people of

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:07,670
course will think of Bitcoin will think

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,799
of cryptocurrencies now this isn't you

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,119
know this isn't surprising in fact this

00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,000
is very important as part of the

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,289
blockchain ecosystem but when you

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
actually think about blockchain you

00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:19,189
should think beyond that a lot of people

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,509
think about the markets they'll think

00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,200
about trading they'll think about how

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,450
they can buy the dips sell at the highs

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,369
they'll think about icos how to launch

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,880
their own token bring in funds raise

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,679
money for for their own projects they'll

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,899
think about bubbles they'll think about

00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:38,869
the environment that we're in the

00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,970
surplus of funding and the described

00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,069
excuse me the discrepancy between

00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,470
projects and money flowing into the

00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,539
ecosystem and of course some people

00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,009
still talk about hackers how bitcoin and

00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:52,159
how crypto currencies have blockchain

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,630
are the tools of the illicit so what I

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,979
want people to start thinking about more

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,440
and more and what I talk about with my

00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,460
clients is thinking beyond that what

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,439
should you be thinking about with

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,180
blockchain and what I think about is

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,189
this I think about development teams

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,479
hard at work designers teams looking to

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,430
actually build the future of our

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,470
infrastructure it's very important that

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,150
we start to think more about how we take

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,130
this technology and build on top of it

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,709
instead of just how we leverage the

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,720
financial aspects of the system to me

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,400
blockchain is more about communities is

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,049
about community building bringing people

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,850
into your ecosystem helping them to

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,989
helping adoption with the projects that

00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,870
you're building helps solve their

00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,730
problems in build on top it's about late

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,170
nights at the office it's about working

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,970
on projects that you feel drive a

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,680
significant impact in the community

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,390
around you working with your team to

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,970
build some really amazing tools

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,780
it's about open source platforms open

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,400
source software

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,819
how many commits you have on your

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,109
project how many developers are engaged

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,690
how many people are watching your

00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:52,280
projects finally it's about building

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,760
something new and connecting the world

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,739
around us so when I look at blockchain I

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,750
really think about us living in a new

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,940
era of open platforms and open

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,879
innovation so over time what we've seen

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,290
is actually the development of kind of

00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,150
opening innovation within and around

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,319
corporate development

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,569
in my world I come from the background

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,209
of technology consulting it used to be

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,069
in order to build technology in order to

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,980
build our business everything has to be

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,610
done and invented here and as we

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,560
progressed a great example is General

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,970
Electric Jack Welsh one of the first

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,819
things that he did when he came into

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,980
General Electric was he said or he

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,290
eliminated what is called NIH or not

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,090
invented here syndrome they started to

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,709
open up to the idea that I can actually

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,060
leverage the tools and technologies that

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,769
are developed by the community in my

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,049
ecosystem and bring it into my

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,150
environment we're seeing the next phase

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,920
of that where individuals and small

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,870
teams can actually start to innovate and

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,340
build platforms build these open

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,909
networks and platforms and leverage

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,530
their own communities as well so what I

00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,569
want to say is you know everyone knows

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,700
how to hold on everyone knows how to buy

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,470
and hold crypto currencies well it's

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,569
really really difficult not everyone

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,430
knows how to build all not everyone

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,470
knows how to build platforms that

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,260
actually drive impact that actually do

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:13,250
something with this technology and this

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,599
is how we create value so that's what I

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,919
want you to keep in mind as I'm going

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,750
through this and as you're listening to

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,900
the the talks the rest of the day is not

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,700
about how you come in you trade how you

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,169
make money off of cryptocurrency but how

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,810
you build something of value how you

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,330
contribute to this ecosystem so why does

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,320
blockchain matter what is the

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,750
centralization matter so you know where

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,860
it all began is of course in 2008-2009

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,229
with the collapse of the financial

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,289
system so Lehman Brothers is the famous

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,849
example a company with over 600 excuse

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:46,010
me 600 billion dollars in assets

00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,199
disappeared overnight this is in large

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,370
part due to the risky behavior of these

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,740
large corporate entities these

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,539
centralized systems essentially acted

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,050
more like hedge funds than they did like

00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:59,830
banks they were taking very very risky

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,900
bets with consumer money in order to

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,970
meet their own needs and eventually this

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,180
caused the collapse of the existing

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,610
financial system leading to bailouts

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,979
leading to a lot of regulate regulatory

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,510
action I think what's important to know

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:19,479
about these types of these types of

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,040
experiences is it's not just you know

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,870
it's not just oh you know what

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,650
I want to feel like I have more control

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:32,540
I have more value over my own life it's

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:34,490
actually having that control thousands

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,440
millions and millions of people lost

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,900
their homes lost their jobs as a result

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,540
of this type of this collapse and this

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,130
is all due to centralized parties

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,090
abusing their power abusing their

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,410
positions Facebook is a more recent one

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,930
Facebook currently when I log on to the

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,240
Facebook platform I'm not it's not my

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,280
Facebook page everything that goes on to

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,980
Facebook belongs to Facebook

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,500
my information my friends my pictures my

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,540
birthdate all that information is on

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,120
Facebook's platform when I talk to my

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,790
friend I'm actually sending a message to

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,830
Facebook who then routes that message to

00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,100
my friend on my behalf it's all still

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,050
Facebook's data Facebook's information

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,720
Facebook's platform and what we've seen

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,230
most recently with Cambridge analytical

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,270
is what happens when a central party

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,040
with this amount of power this amount of

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,710
information actually abuses their

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,500
position and then uses that data to help

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,650
malicious actors actually gain control

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,650
over society in the case of Cambridge at

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,110
analytic they helped by collecting 50

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,960
million user excuse me 50 million users

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,660
data using that to actually create

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,600
politically targeted ads and influence

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,590
elections now this again is another

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,050
example of these large parties taking

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,150
seemingly small positions with the

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,340
information in the centralized power

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,310
they have but greatly impacting people's

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,310
lives the last thing I want to talk

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,010
about is actually something that maybe

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,170
some of you are aware of when star wars

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,040
Jimmy when the Star Wars franchise was

00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,700
bought by Disney

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,950
so Star Wars is a huge phenomenon huge

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,390
cult following which is an it is amazing

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,090
I love Star Wars and I'm sure many of

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,100
you here do too many people invest their

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,930
very livelihood and the characters and

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,480
the stories they create their games

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,820
their movies their comic books their

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,770
novels all based around Star Wars when

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,690
Disney came in and bought the Star Wars

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,430
franchise what they actually did was

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,050
bought the rights to the entire series

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,330
so your lives that were dead

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,770
kated - this entire storyline - the

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,569
characters that you followed for your

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,280
entire life that maybe you contributed

00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,050
to now became under the control of

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,810
Disney who then kicked all that

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,080
information out and decided this is core

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,690
canon this in these storylines we see as

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,330
part of the Star Wars universe these

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,460
guys not so much people invested their

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,830
entire lives and what they loved on

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:05,030
these stories just had them simply

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,129
thrown away so to me decentralization

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,090
means taking power back over our own

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,979
lives and so this means things like so

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,500
what are we building to actually take

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,449
our power back so with the company I

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,490
work with we are working on a product

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,919
called you port you port is a self

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,900
sovereign digital identity it's a way

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,460
for you to actually own the information

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,379
about your own life it's a way that for

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,699
you to actually own your digital self as

00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:33,169
you move about in the real world this is

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,579
what what we're doing with you port is

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,860
looking at how you can actually own your

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,649
own medical record rather than having to

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:44,209
go from a doctor to an insurance

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:47,690
provider to another facility actually

00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:49,430
creating a digital record that I possess

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,079
that I control that I disclose

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:56,029
information to each one of those parties

00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:58,279
and maintain is whole if I walk up to if

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,410
I walk to a border crossing if I'm

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,540
trying to enter a new country disclosing

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,610
elements of my passport the ability to

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,790
prove that I have a right to come into

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,520
this country my visa is valid without

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,470
disclosing elements of private data

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,709
maybe I don't need to reveal my birthday

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,720
maybe I don't need to reveal my social

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:22,579
social security number if I have other

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,649
services on accesing akasha is a very

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,510
interesting project creating a

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,940
decentralized social network to take on

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,699
Facebook to take on LinkedIn to take on

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,130
Twitter these networks that rely on

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:37,040
central storage and monetization of data

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,959
at the expense of consumers working to

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,480
actually give consumers their own data

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,779
back so they can then create their own

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,920
networks and create their own value and

00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,420
probably one of my favorite projects is

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
this project called hilarious and why

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,980
bring up Star Wars hilarious is creating

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,400
what is called the transmedia franchise

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,470
owned by the creators owned by each and

00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,690
every one of you if you invest your

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,040
lives in a story if you invest your

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:06,440
lives in a character whether it's

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,450
creation or adaptation or producing

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,790
brand-new content you can contribute

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,260
that content to the Solaris universe you

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,610
can then build on top you can own a

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,680
piece of that character you can own

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,080
rights to it and those characters will

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,640
live on forever just like the platform

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:25,010
underneath so these are all great cases

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,540
for individuals but that's not the only

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,130
thing that blockchain is great for

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,530
Bahrain is also great for enterprises

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,350
and this is what I do on a daily basis

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,900
so how I got into the space was through

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,930
supply chain it's incredibly important

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,970
through our supply chains today to know

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,250
where our food comes from and it's not

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,270
so much because it feels good knowing oh

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:50,120
this food is organic this food is GMO

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,740
free it's not about feeling good it's

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,200
about on the other end of the supply

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,720
chain giving people the basic human

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,000
rights that they deserve why when I go

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,130
to the store does this pound of shrimp

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,410
cost two dollars less than that pound

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,890
what is the reason for that what happens

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,660
in the background so what a team working

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,610
on a project called violent is doing is

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,850
actually creating the basic structure to

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,130
create a an immutable record of supply

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,130
chain provenance so when a piece of

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,380
shrimp is fished out of an ocean or

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,970
fished out of a farm I can track that as

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,580
it moves through the supply chain and I

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,260
can know where it was caught I can know

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,060
that it was produced in sustainable

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,210
conditions I can know it was produced

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,910
ethic ethically and legally and these

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,170
are in very very important things for

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,280
deciding what we as consumers do with

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,900
our money JPMorgan is working on a

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,850
platform called quorum a fork of the

00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,800
etherium platform this is all open

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,450
source and free to use they're actually

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,010
using this to create better financial

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,720
infrastructure to lower the risk of

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,630
financial institutions as they go

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,660
through their daily business one of the

00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:02,030
prime kind of motivations in the space

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,990
is something called his is it real-time

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,730
settlement

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,770
my real-time settlement is important is

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,870
it lowers risk the reason why your

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,089
credit card costs a couple percent is

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,610
because of the risk associated the

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:16,190
credit cards are taking by fronting the

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,839
money on your behalf what this does what

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,540
real-time settlement does is it ensures

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,180
that assets once processed are settled

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,190
at the immediately lowering that risk

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,170
and allowing financial institutions to

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,700
provide you services and much lower

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:33,230
rates and and one of the projects here

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,940
in Singapore is with the Monetary

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,830
Authority which is really setting an

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,720
example for central banks globally

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,029
they're actually looking at taking a

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,430
very powerful existing system the RTGS

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:46,220
system here in Singapore and creating a

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,600
system where banks can settle directly

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,750
with each other real-time gross

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,700
settlement with each other with the

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,910
Monetary Authority taking a passive

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,010
stance on allowing them to interact but

00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,510
not taking a an active stance and having

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,220
to process each one of these payments

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,980
they're lowering the cost of their own

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,660
services they're lowering the reliance

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,880
on a single party in order to create a

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,520
more efficient financial system here for

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,579
Singapore and beyond

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,779
I think blockchain has really spurred a

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,490
lot of things but one of the greatest

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,500
aspects of blockchain is the amount of

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,720
collaboration we are seeing in industry

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,670
so the enterprise aetherium alliance

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,649
which this is a fraction of the members

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,540
part of that Alliance today has over 200

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:28,250
members it's a mix of startups it's a

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,380
mix of corporates it's a mix of

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,660
governments all working together to

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,350
establish the standards for using

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,320
blockchain technology and enterprise we

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,000
are working specifically with a few of

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,850
these companies on developing standards

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,940
for supply chains establishing standards

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:51,950
for lending it's a very very because of

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,250
this technology we're seeing just a new

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:57,110
approach to business it's not this is my

00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,940
bound these are my boundaries this is my

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,920
business it's how are we as an industry

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,870
going to come together and actually

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,149
change the way we do business with each

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,589
other on our and our consumers behalf

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,959
and lastly the book the Brooklyn Project

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,449
is working to actually establish

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,240
responsible token standards so that we

00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:18,100
so that the

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,589
tokens that enter the marketplace are

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,160
done so responsibly to protect both

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:27,120
investors consumers alike so this is a

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,950
group of companies looking to basically

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,890
reinvent the token launch and ICO

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:35,339
process that is an act of

00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:38,470
self-regulation before being regulated

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:42,279
so why should you get started building

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,260
on blockchain perhaps is because you see

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,510
a massive talent shortage perhaps you

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,020
are looking for a way to jump into

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,459
industry you're looking for a new edge

00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,350
there are hundreds if not thousands of

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,870
companies looking for blockchain experts

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,700
ready to hire people who know these

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,370
skills know how to code on watching and

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,870
develop blockchain applications maybe

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,730
it's because it's an open frontier

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,890
there's a lot of opportunity in front of

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,149
you there's so much infrastructure

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,850
there's so many products that still need

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,010
to be built and that there's little

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,990
there's little there that's preventing

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,820
you from actually being a leader in the

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,470
space or maybe you want to create

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,260
something entirely new create something

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:25,899
that has impact so how do you start

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:28,839
building so this is one way I highly

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,490
recommend downloading truffle truffle is

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,610
a development framework that will allow

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,899
you to very very quickly spin up a test

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,120
environment and start building the

00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,339
blockchain apps it will take a lot of

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,950
the complexities of the etherium network

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,450
and move it behind the scenes so you're

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:49,180
able to start coding apps very very

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:52,000
quickly then I recommend that you dive

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,890
into their aetherium overview and their

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,779
pet shop tutorial or any of the

00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,360
tutorials on their webpage this will

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,279
give you a first insight into how this

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,300
technology works what makes it different

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:07,240
and actually a real life example of

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:10,630
implementing it yourself next create a

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,829
wallet download meta mask by a small

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,899
amount of cryptocurrency

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:16,660
transfer test with it play with it

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,940
understand how it works why it's

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,380
important why security matters why these

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,810
things matter in the blockchain

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,720
ecosystem participate in a hackathon

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,490
come to events like these meet people

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,860
work on interesting projects with them

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,930
try your skills improve

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,240
and finally keep learning and keep

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,920
exploring although things like truffle

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,839
or truffle are great ways to get started

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,519
it's not everything you need to

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,199
understand more of what goes on under

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,690
the hoods and under the hood and there's

00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,910
a vibrant community out there online
