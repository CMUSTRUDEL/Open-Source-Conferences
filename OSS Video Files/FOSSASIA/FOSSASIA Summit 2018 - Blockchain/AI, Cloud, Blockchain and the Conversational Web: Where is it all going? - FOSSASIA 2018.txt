At the leadership opening panel of the FOSSASIA Summit we bring technologists, developers and digital journalists together who will help us to understand what where we are heading with this rapid change. Where are opportunities, where are challenges? Panelists will provide insights from their personal perspective and their daily work. What will distinguish us from machines in future? What do we need to learn to stay ahead of the competition? What tools and technologies are most promising? Does everyone need to be a coder in future? And how can Open Technologies help us?
