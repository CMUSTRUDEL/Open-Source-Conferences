Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#dilum-navanjana3130

Cryptocurrencies have there own APIs expose for developers to access. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is the easiest way among those APIs. It works as a Restful API for the blockchain network. Using those APIs you

You can do what ever the blockchain work you want with those APIs. So in my talk I will talk about how to use those APIs to connect to most famous Bitcoin &amp Ethereum networks. So you can programmatically do transactions &amp everything.

hi hi guys so welcome to this talk about

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:27,619
it Syrian bitcoin our PC API so if you

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,560
remember in the last talk he mentioned

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:33,079
about JSON as we are PC ApS in the

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,710
presentation so I am planning to go

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:41,030
deeper into that topic with aetherium

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,610
and Bitcoin how that JSON RPC is working

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,010
and how you can connect to those api's

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,280
with your own node without using any

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,249
third party like block Explorer or else

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,679
either scan or someone else third party

00:00:52,249 --> 00:01:00,050
API so this will be good for programmers

00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:05,239
developers who would like to start

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:08,360
working on it Syrian Bitcoin stuff after

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,110
this conference or as from today onwards

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:18,640
so it will be a good chance for you to

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:21,860
start your career with blockchain things

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,320
so I'm the lumina on China and this is

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,990
my github and this is my Twitter if you

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,260
have any questions after this talk you

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,990
can just treat me and I will reply I'm

00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,840
from even though I'm working here in

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,750
Singapore I'm from this little South

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
Asian island called sri lanka hope at

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,790
least you have heard about Sri Lanka and

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,740
in Sri Lanka we have nice beaches and we

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:52,760
have tea plantations and special we have

00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,590
elephants and I am a Cote member of

00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,440
celluloid if you haven't heard about

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,890
celluloid celluloid east concurrency and

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,610
parallel processing third party tool or

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,740
else Jim in Ruby working with Ruby

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,319
Foundation so I am called a team member

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,659
of celluloid working with them and going

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,550
around Asia are talking about

00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:16,510
concurrency power processing but here

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:20,930
today I am talking about blockchain and

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:24,680
according to the Ruby foundations found

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,200
this definition I'm a roo beast and here

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,490
in Singapore I am working in a start-up

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,580
called B bite

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,230
and mainly we are working with ruby

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:39,140
stuff ruby back-end development API AIDS

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,750
and everything and also specially we are

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,700
working with blockchain private

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,980
blockchains public blockchains like

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,960
private blockchains like big chain DB

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:54,650
and we are given with aetherium bitcoin

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:58,460
smart contracts so on yes and we are

00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,240
hiring yes if any of you are familiar

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,120
with developments with big blockchain

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,850
and any decentralized payment platforms

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,040
yes we would like to talk with you so

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,190
after this talk or else I'll be here

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,490
around this conference maybe today and

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:20,150
tomorrow and Sunday so just come to me

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,950
and talk to me we are hiring and we have

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,450
our own IC o---- up and running these

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:29,090
days for our future plan of having a

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,550
decentralized payment platform so it is

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,630
big TK dot IO if you would like to have

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:38,680
how big token is going to disrupt this

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:43,070
decentralized payment platform or else

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:47,210
how how we are going to have our own

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:50,990
talk and just have a look and this is a

00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,240
technical presentation but I am NOT

00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,610
going to define what's cryptocurrency or

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,370
else I am NOT going to define what is

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,980
Bitcoin or else what is it cerium

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,620
because we have just 20 minutes 25

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,300
minutes and you can just go to Google

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:12,260
and just search for those things but as

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:15,140
developers we all love API so when we

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,120
start working on something if we want to

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,950
learn new things the first thing that we

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,980
would like to search in online is api's

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:28,070
are there any exposed api's for this

00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:32,560
technology or elles for this framework

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:35,450
that we can use in our existing existing

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,620
services or elles applications so that's

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,440
what I also did when I was assigned to

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,960
do

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:49,410
blockchain works with deuterium and

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:52,580
Bitcoin in my workplace so then as I

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:59,010
checked all cryptocurrencies I checked

00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:05,910
how ApS exposed from their nodes Bitcoin

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:09,390
ATM litecoin so on so to use or else to

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,350
consume those api's to consume those RPC

00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:16,650
api's we need node up and running or

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,570
else a daemon up and running for testing

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:22,440
purposes I prefer to have a docker

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:27,050
container which runs those demons or

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,840
else nodes this is the Bitcoin daemon

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,370
container that I created for my testing

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,930
purposes if you would like to have a

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:40,470
loop it is just a Bitcoin demon inside a

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,570
container and you can just all start

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,720
this docker container and consume those

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,580
RPC APs it's open source just have a

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,550
look and if you want you can use it as

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,210
well and this is the e TM docker

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,710
container that I used actually I created

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,870
this etherium container inside this

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,480
container it's their society we have

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,200
node running so it is easy for you you

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:10,950
don't have to install any get over else

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,200
any C++ libraries all of them inside

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,960
this container you just have run this

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,980
docker container and it will be the node

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:25,100
will be up but you have to start syncing

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:29,430
your node after running this container

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:32,280
or else if you would like to have your

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:38,100
own demon or else node you can run you

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,680
can install whatever the things that you

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,630
need to install before running the

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,169
daemon and then start running your own

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:49,890
demon so you have your own demon or else

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:53,370
not running in your local host so after

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:57,000
that connecting to this RPC API is as

00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:00,120
I like as simple as running this curl

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,820
command to this port in your localhost

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,389
so that it's that much of simple to

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,350
connect to those RPC api's so each idiom

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:13,320
has their own interpreters communication

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:18,360
IPC API sand as well as remote procedure

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:21,990
call RPC because our pc api is exposed

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,940
and bitcoin has their own remote

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:31,199
procedure calls only

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:36,360
and this is the bitcoin RPC api

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,610
documentation and this is more so if you

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,570
want to just look at how this api s--

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:47,340
works RPC API works just go to those

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:50,340
documentation x' and you can see there

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:54,690
are like so many api is exposed from

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:58,470
these RPC api api is from the nodes and

00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:02,460
you can use those API is to have like

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,070
your own like a Bitcoin client or else

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,789
something that you can use for your own

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:13,650
use or else to there are so many things

00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:16,229
that you can do and this is a DVM RPC

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:21,229
API documentation link so you can just

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:25,349
go there and this is a common RPC API

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:27,539
that you can use i if you are consuming

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,090
those aps you don't need to unlock your

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:35,000
any of your wallets you can just use

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:40,169
those api sand consume those transaction

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,750
like you can get blog details using the

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,670
block hash or else you can get the

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,560
transaction details using the

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,390
transaction hash you don't have to

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,150
unlock your wallet for those kind of

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:54,270
information or else you can get your

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:59,760
count count means wallet IDs inside

00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:04,350
these node and also you can get whatever

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,600
the wallets balance using those api's so

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,339
this is the API documentation detailed

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:15,000
nation for get balanced so there are two

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:17,639
parameters you have to pass so the

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,589
volatile and as well as the if you want

00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,759
to get the latest balance you have to

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,500
pass laters

00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:28,380
so then you can get any of the wallets

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,649
helium wallets balance from using this

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,250
API and this is the etherium management

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:40,350
API which is more powerful than the

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:43,230
normal API is this management API is we

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,740
can use for your bullet related things

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:50,819
like unlock your wallet lock your wallet

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,500
or else create a new wallet and similar

00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:55,620
transactions especially if you would

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,670
like to use this API to send a

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,680
transaction you can use that as well

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,230
from like if you want to send the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,139
transaction program Akali from like

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,410
herbs from your server application side

00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,089
without using any graphical client you

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,519
can use those ApS to say in the

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,829
transaction but to send the transaction

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,250
you have to unlock your wallet using

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:23,810
that unlock API and then you can send

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:26,579
those transactions so this is the API

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,819
detailed documentation what you have to

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:32,490
pass to unlock your wallet you have to

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,519
pass the wallet ID and as well as the

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,759
wallets passphrase and then how many

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,790
seconds you need this wallet to be

00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,160
unlocked so this is in this example it

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,910
is 30 seconds so after 30 seconds your

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:52,399
wallet will be looked ematic lee default

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:55,199
is around 300 seconds as I remember so

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,670
because I love Ruby and I am working

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:02,040
with Ruby most of the time using this

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,759
RPC API is for Bitcoin and aetherium

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,880
right now I created a gem called el

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,130
chapo' so this is actually a ruby

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,649
wrapper for this RPC api if you would

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,040
like to have and any of you are familiar

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:21,300
with ruby or LLC if you if any of you

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,389
are any of you would like to learn Ruby

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,670
and using Ruby in your server side then

00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:30,600
this will be a good chance for you to

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:34,880
use those RPC API is in Ruby very easily

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:39,180
other than just calling press clients

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,620
the name this el chapo' is coming from

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,290
some funny stories and the reason is mmm

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:51,329
one day I can come to a conference like

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:54,029
this and I can say to people that I am

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:57,809
the creator of El Chapo so that's the

00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:01,949
reason this gem called el chapo came to

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:04,500
me and this is the gem how it works you

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:09,509
can create Bitcoin HTTP connection new

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,990
and you have to send the URL and the

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:16,019
port and as well as when you are running

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:18,509
starting your Bitcoin client you have to

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,389
send you have to mention your username

00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,040
and password for the RPC client and you

00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:26,959
have to pass this using the same

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,480
username and password for this Bitcoin

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:35,160
wrapper so then using this BTC

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:39,740
underscore client you can use those RPC

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:43,529
api's as a method call in your Ruby code

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,649
so then I managed to do my connection

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:50,009
between my Ruby server side rails server

00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:54,240
side and as with Bitcoin or else

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:58,139
etherium client so my work office

00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,540
related work is done but on a weekend I

00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,899
was so bored and I didn't have any plans

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:07,399
to do and because I had this gem with me

00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:12,439
and I wanted to do something interesting

00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:15,360
so I got the idea to convert blockchain

00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:20,639
to convert a blockchain to SQL so this

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:23,540
is my initial idea but then I managed to

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,540
like

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,900
do this to something like this so this

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,860
is my initial this was my initial plan

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:38,880
few months ago to convert all Bitcoin

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,880
transactions to hql so the reason that I

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,960
wanted to do convert everything to SQL

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:49,110
is to find the highest transaction value

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,970
happened inside Bitcoin so today I will

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,470
tell you what are the what are those

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,930
transactions happened in Bitcoin and

00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:00,510
what's the date and everything so after

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,050
converting so last week I managed to

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:10,560
finish all the conversion from the block

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:12,960
1 to 500 k plus right now

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:18,480
so what I did was I was going through

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:23,339
the blocks from 0 to 500 k plus from a

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:26,190
ruby gesture from a ruby script and this

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,980
is an example that I am getting for a

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,820
Bitcoin block so it has so many

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,130
information like the Bitcoin hash block

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,350
hash and the size and everything and

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:41,790
then the most important thing is the

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:45,060
transactions number IDs hash hashes for

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:48,240
this block so its array and inside once

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,720
I found these transaction IDs then I

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,060
read through those transactions and this

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,050
is what I get for the transaction row

00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:00,690
details so each transaction I get who is

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:04,650
the sender holds the receiver and what's

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:08,400
the value and everything so I wrote the

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:12,740
Ruby script and I used activerecord

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:15,450
to save it to my SQL and then this is a

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,110
example of my database I am you I am

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:22,320
saving the block number and transaction

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:25,170
ID the block hash and the most important

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,900
thing is the value and transaction

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:31,560
created date and updated ease is that

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,540
that I updated this day and sender

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:38,370
receiver and the balance receiver so I

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,000
have I had all details of these for all

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,540
trans

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,970
chance of Bitcoin right now so initially

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,410
I thought it will take maximum five days

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,500
but I was wrong

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:55,080
it took me around like more than one

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:57,780
month to finish everything so on the

00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,400
process after like two weeks I realized

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:05,760
my script was not the most powerful

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,630
script that I could run to can convert

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,200
everything so I used a gym or else a

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:16,260
method called bulk insert to insert 500

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:21,240
trans transactions by 500 transaction to

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,490
my MySQL database which makes it a

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,600
little bit faster but not fast enough to

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:30,540
convene it within few days so by last

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:37,620
week actually I managed to finish

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:39,600
everything so the database contained 236

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,490
million nine hundred and fifteen

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,720
thousand six hundred and twenty

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:51,450
transactions and the database size is

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:57,330
seventy six point six three GB MySQL

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:59,550
database this it's some example and my

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:03,570
initial plan was to find the highest

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:06,000
value transferred within Bitcoin and few

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,430
more researchers after going on with my

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,089
database because I have the sender and I

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,770
have the receiver so like I have some

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,829
more information about the transaction

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:24,720
happened through the day a Bitcoin

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:28,290
network so this is the highest

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:33,120
transaction happened within 2009

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:36,870
so within 2009 the year of 2009 the

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,650
highest value transferred is 6000

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:43,260
bitcoins it happens on these days so I

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,140
will go through the year by year first

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,290
of all and then I will give you what's

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,600
the highest value and in 2010 it is

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:59,820
90,000 bitcoins the transaction happened

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:03,910
November 9th 2010 and 2011 it is almost

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:09,250
500k Bitcoin so it is happened on

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:14,919
November 16th 2011 and in 2012 it went

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:19,330
down to 125,000 bitcoins transferred on

00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:28,240
this day in a transaction and 2013 these

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:32,940
and 14 it is this 15 it is this 16 it is

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:38,440
these and 17 it is 50000 exactly 50000

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:40,780
transferred on august 2 n Ogas ii 2017

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,940
which was about like eight months ago

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:49,929
and so the highest transaction of all

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:56,880
the time would goes to the transaction

00:18:49,929 --> 00:19:01,900
happened on 2011 November 16th on block

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,700
in this block II that is four hundred

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,419
and ninety nine thousand seven hundred

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,309
and twenty point seven bi bitcoins

00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:12,039
transferred so if you go to this block

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:14,049
on blocks pleura you can see that

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,140
transaction on this block there were

00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:23,409
like about three transactions and one

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:27,190
transaction is this transaction but the

00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:30,940
highest transaction value in USD so at

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:36,190
the transaction time if you take this

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:40,450
transaction converted into USD in 2011

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:44,559
it was about like 2 million USD we just

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:47,020
not the best in comparing to other

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,070
transactions so the highest transaction

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:56,190
value in USD would goes to this

00:19:51,070 --> 00:20:00,940
transaction 2017 fifty fifty thousand

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:05,440
bitcoins so in this I checked the price

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,190
of Bitcoin on august 2nd 2017 on that

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,529
day

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:14,529
it was about 2,700 USD the one Bitcoin

00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:22,799
and because of that that transaction

00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:25,210
value in USD ease about 135 million USD

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,779
transferred on that day which was like

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:32,230
eight months ago and if you want to

00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:34,720
check all the transaction details I have

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:38,889
this is my blog I have mentioned all the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,340
blogs flora transaction URLs they are in

00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:44,529
a blog post with all those yeah

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,559
yes transactions and everything so if

00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:50,860
you want to have a look detail look on

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:53,610
those transaction just go to this just

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:59,700
go to my blog Gannon it will be there

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:59,700
okay I think it's done and any actions

00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:10,690
no I'm planning to try some indexes yes

00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:14,080
because so right now if I write a query

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:18,370
for searching the highest value within

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,370
these it takes like three minutes to

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:24,419
complete the query so it is yeah I need

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,419
to write some indexes

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:35,850
sorry yes I I have some plans I don't

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,010
need to keep it secret as a database

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,280
with me I would like to share this

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:44,610
database so because it I got this

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,070
database last week I will upload it to

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,200
somewhere and like first of all I need

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,380
to check how I can compress the database

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:59,640
into 7-zip or something and then I will

00:21:52,380 --> 00:22:05,340
try with public yes for sure yes I can

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:07,710
do it like not right now but so right

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:13,100
now the speed of converting everything

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:18,350
is I can convert one month transactions

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:21,919
within one day so so like I have almost

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,020
until the start of this month

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:31,380
transactions converted so if I run like

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:33,690
one day it will be synced and like yes

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,730
because I am using one of my personal

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,100
machines to do these right now this

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:44,490
could be stopped but if I start it will

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:48,900
start syncing every day I need to create

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:51,659
a graph from actually what I need to do

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,570
is so because I have all the

00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:57,419
transactions with me I need to calculate

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:00,720
who has the highest value in his wallet

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:04,130
in users fuller right now and maybe I

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,929
will sort from highest to lowest the

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:21,870
wallets and then maybe I will publish

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:24,240
and I will write a blog post so my

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,850
docker client I was using it for my

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,140
testing purposes but the docker client

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:34,260
in the main network couldn't handle that

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,679
much of syncing database with Bitcoin so

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,730
I had to use my own doctor deem

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,390
coin demon inside

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:46,169
my machine hmm

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:51,860
I'm not pretty much yes it's the normal

00:23:46,169 --> 00:24:11,820
size around like 200 GB I remember yeah

00:23:51,860 --> 00:24:14,940
in corrections the transactions yes

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:19,799
so those APIs are public API those RPC

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:32,309
ApS I my database they school database I

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:34,590
download is it Ruby

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:37,080
that's the Ruby wrapper actually it's

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,690
not gonna yeah if you have a node

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,370
running and then only you can connect to

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:46,700
your node using my wrapper yeah you have

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,700
a cookie

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,250
mr. Roach in three countries among not

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,800
be everyone

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:01,460
you feel you can do this and a lot of

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,460
protein

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:15,490
yeah yes

00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:29,270
probably by exchange yes yeah that's

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:33,340
true yes I have some plans because I

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:38,030
have all the senders and receivers maybe

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:41,840
so one of the researchers contacted me

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:45,200
asked me to create some using this

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,890
database something like if you remember

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,730
that Windows virus that good affected

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:55,820
last year ransomware so they asked to

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:59,170
pay them using Bitcoin so if if you have

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:03,680
some way that we can track those that

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:06,440
Bitcoin wallets and like check those

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,500
four words how how they spend their

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,930
wallet money and those kind of things so

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:17,450
if I use this database for those kind of

00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:20,480
things so I might do some graphs

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:24,260
something like that if if you enter a

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,930
wallet ID then you can see what are the

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,990
past transactions he go to and what are

00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,790
the things that he spend on and where he

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,890
spends on like what are the other

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,230
wallets that he connected and everything

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:42,730
so which will be like more interesting

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:42,730
for the people yes okay yeah thank you

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,959
