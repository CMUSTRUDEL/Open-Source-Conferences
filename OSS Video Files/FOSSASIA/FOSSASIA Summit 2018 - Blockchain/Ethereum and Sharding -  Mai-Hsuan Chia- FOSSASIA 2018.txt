okay and after it is verified by knows

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,670
if there is no accident it will be

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,190
included in the blushin and the block so

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,740
the block has the field previous block

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:37,250
hash in times then and the transactions

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,260
and the blockchain is actually the chain

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:45,110
of blocks and in this chain by the

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:49,790
hashes so let's see this blush in the

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:53,780
block a but B the blobbies hash is said

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:56,600
to the block ace hash it is chained so

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,540
and it is append only so if you want to

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:04,910
make a new block you must append to the

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:08,140
existing box function so that assume

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,989
there is a block see you must set the

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:16,130
previous block hash as the latest block

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:20,810
and it will append it to the existing

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:24,830
existing Bastion and the purpose of the

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:29,090
chain of blocks is it makes attackers

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,640
hard to temper the function because if

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,510
you modify any fields anything in the

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:40,850
blockchain history you can find out that

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:43,160
when you do calculations when verifying

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,250
the whole block chain and the

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,860
transaction zone is confirmed only if it

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,630
is recorded in the blockchain and the

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,980
order of transaction is determined

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:58,010
because inside one block there is the

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:02,840
older of transactions because it is a

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:05,440
list and between the blocks because you

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,030
know the the order of the transactions

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,190
I'm sorry you know the order of the

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,910
blocks so you can determine all of the

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:17,900
transactions older and this block chains

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:22,400
used to serve as the single history for

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:25,600
or nodes so on all the nodes just

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,200
believe in this single history

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,320
and there's something there's some

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,740
question like how to extend the

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,800
pollution actually everyone can extend

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,530
the blockchain but that the one with

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,670
more power has the bigger chance to

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,670
extend the blockchain so it's the

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:54,320
incentive of doing this is money it is

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:59,210
so called mining that's assume there are

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:05,050
two people here two notes and why is the

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:11,020
girl one is smaller so the chance of the

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:16,510
the chance to extend the Russian is is

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:20,120
bigger for the one with more power and

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:23,570
that's divine power in Bitcoin in the

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,800
current theorem we use proof of work

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:30,169
which is known as POWs and this is the

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:36,080
one with more computing power has more

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:40,669
power and another famous why is cos this

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:45,380
is the idea is the one with more stake

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:49,790
has more power the state means how much

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:56,390
money do you have in the blushin yes

00:05:49,790 --> 00:06:00,230
and let's talk about a theorem if even

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:03,770
it has its own blockchain and you use P

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:07,280
o W and we will change to the POS in the

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,970
future maybe someone must give me some

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,760
people already heard of the keyword

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:18,470
Casper it is still in the test net

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:23,210
testing yes and another feature of it

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:26,110
theory is it has a smart contract so the

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,280
right hand side is Coast nighted I

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,790
snippet in Viper

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,410
so is base it is the basic country that

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:41,480
hosts maintains the counter and you it

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:44,830
has a method allows user to call you can

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,720
include the increment the counter and

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:53,690
then you have a method to get the

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:59,450
counters value and currently we have a

00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:02,600
scaling issue some many people's are

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:08,050
concerned now because the current

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,050
transaction per second is slow it's low

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:19,190
like Bitcoin has TPS of seven and if

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:26,450
there is 15 and while the visa has ten

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:29,030
thousands of TPS so and there are more

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:33,650
and more applications appearing in a

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,220
theorem like the tokens noise known by

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,060
everyone

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:43,010
er C 20 and crypto kiddies it is the

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:46,400
famous skin and it

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:49,340
there is one period that the Crypt the

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,330
transaction of the crypto Kitty's stuck

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:57,540
the whole if your network so make the

00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:00,930
payments hard in different at a time

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:06,210
and crypto zombie and other games so we

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:10,260
need a higher TPS and what is the reason

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:13,440
causing this actually one of the reason

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:16,830
is every no handles all of the

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:21,690
transactions so if we want to deal with

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:23,430
the problem we must make one note only

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,790
deal with part of the transactions

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:33,930
instead of all of them so it is the idea

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:37,770
of sharding about ether ensuring the

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:40,820
basic idea is we just divide a big

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,310
blockchain into multiple shards so like

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,450
think of it is just really big big

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,450
Russian and

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,770
you

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,270
fashion processing capability of the

00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:22,870
mention and we have the shark town is

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,720
big OC and transaction processing

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,260
capability of attraction is also big big

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,070
OC because it is the chin right so the

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:37,110
total of the whole charting system will

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,110
be shark count times

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:15,090
[Music]

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,990
I have a scenario of the collator how it

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,140
works

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,140
and

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,320
I just this mention is the new is the

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:32,250
oath back instead of a new one the new

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:37,290
one it becomes becoming more complicated

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:40,889
so I just introduced the old one and the

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,740
phase two is I'm sorry the phase one

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:50,779
basically we read we don't care about

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:55,709
the execution of transactions and until

00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:59,579
phase two we add it back which means we

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:02,220
allows transaction executed and phase

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:05,040
three is like client state protocol and

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,910
phase 4 we will implement the crosier

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,779
our transactions this is actually a hard

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,170
problem and we're still figuring out how

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:18,649
to do it and the phase five the type

00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:24,899
coupling with mentioned security because

00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:28,010
as I just described we're we're doing

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:31,949
something like we depends on the mention

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,690
that that is loose coupling so

00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,750
everything in the char chain is

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,610
determined by dimension so in this phase

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:44,670
we will change that and the Phase six

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,140
will achieve super quadratic sharding

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:51,930
and

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:54,630
and that's my that's my talk so the

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,930
reference from Bitcoin my paper

00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:02,160
if they're in my favor and the starting

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:04,830
phase one spec is in our foreign it is a

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,560
post so if you are interested you can

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:11,060
check it out and then the sharding ffq

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:14,700
they describe the problems we

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:18,089
encountered and we're still discussing

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:21,540
about and the shutting repo

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:25,560
it contains the old code in our shot in

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:30,150
POC and we will put our new country

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:33,120
there and the documents there and the

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:36,710
current implementation in pi e BN is

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,710
this repository

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,650
that's it

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:57,529
okay face one yes last 556 your sake

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:11,640
sorry I can you repeat that question use

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:14,669
the whole face is six faces right yes so

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:25,710
your target always don't forget complete

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:30,080
all the faces I think it is not clear

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:37,580
for now yes because you know progressing

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:37,580
something are still under discussion yes

00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,190
you mean sharding

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:51,770
five like 55 people yes currently and

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:58,120
mmm

00:18:51,770 --> 00:19:04,060
some of us are in Taiwan and some of one

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:07,270
one researcher is in London and like and

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:21,740
Vitalik will get give us another

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:24,250
suggestion it is open source okay your

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,250
REO okay

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,280
where you can sort of see a little leg

00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,280
look and

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,980
yeah if you

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:51,809
but your vertical there are actually a

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,549
lot of post discussing the whole stack

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,549
and in the problems

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:25,140
sorry hmm I mean crow shocked or my

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:29,970
conflict my conflict I I don't think so

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:33,470
it should be separate state so the

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:37,040
execution within one shard does not

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,040
affect it bye

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:07,200
for from my understanding we separate

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:10,560
the state for previously so if we want

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,310
to do some crow shard things we will go

00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:18,140
back to mention and the consensus will

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,140
be made in mentioning

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:25,210
so so isn't that the code that splits

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,690
the charge the first place

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,100
guarantees there's no conflicts

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,050
conflicting accounts ahead of time or is

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:40,240
that resolved when you try to reconcile

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:44,320
in the main you can think that if you in

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,980
our early stage if you want to do some

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,810
operation in chard in some chard you

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:55,000
have to move your lock your money in

00:21:51,810 --> 00:22:00,940
invention and therefore you can create

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,520
the money in that char yeah so the

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,520
operation will not be affected

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:23,170
any so far and it's a good question I

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:32,660
because we just have a news back yes so

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:45,860
many things still be still need my fine

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:49,700
a lot yeah oh okay so for charting in

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:53,050
its lair one solution right it is done

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:57,230
it is down inside the blockchain and

00:22:53,050 --> 00:23:01,429
there are still other options like layer

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:05,710
two solutions is on top of the blushing

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:10,540
and like there are state channel and

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:15,590
there are plasma and they're like

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,530
station oh basically make the many of

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:22,370
the transactions of offline

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:25,970
so many like micro payments transactions

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:33,140
they are not going to the blockchain so

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:36,010
it dramatically reduced the number of

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,010
the transactions

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:34,159
they didn't see how transactions mmm

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,159
you mean within white shark or

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,669
yes right now I was approximately 10

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,110
seconds right yes what started I see

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:54,940
it's going to give you a larger volume

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,770
of transactions in that period of time

00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,220
desolate also increased the latency that

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:03,340
is like mounting 30 seconds before it

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:08,749
shows up order to still be under the

00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:16,789
okay so if we you in the sharding phase

00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:22,190
one I just won collation one period has

00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:26,419
one collation so and the current period

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:31,429
is five blocks in mention so there are

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:42,559
five times the current long time is

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:45,440
about 15 so is 75 so in in in this

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,649
settings the the latency will will will

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,759
increase but there are still some

00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:56,839
research about this like reducing the

00:25:52,759 --> 00:26:01,759
number of blocks within a period maybe

00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:07,669
reducing it to one and it will make the

00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:11,019
latency just like the one in in in

00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:11,019
original Ethier

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,369
there are tricky to do I agree it back

00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,369
down

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,460
Health Service went into the state

00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,850
but I mean in short there's a lot of

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,030
trade-offs to these things whether it be

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,099
like walk latency

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,099
[Music]

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,610
and in general our sorrows

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,020
obviously you have the system that one

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,310
you know so you want to see when they

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,310
start grabbing a ball team

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,170
decent numbers all

00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:19,259
that what this day the bodies were real

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,259
hardwood that we're getting soon

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,520
be aware

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,950
any more question okay okay

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:47,900
currently in our face once back it is

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:52,809
100 currently but it should be larger it

00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,809
can be extended yeah

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,950
they deceive

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,940
okay

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,580
you mean latency or

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:23,749
on it is not because of it is not due to

00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:26,149
the short count number of chars

00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:30,169
it is not because of that it is because

00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:34,539
we said the period has five blocks

00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:34,539
you mentioned yes

00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:44,920
our uterus of the etherium good is this

00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:46,990
a schematically happen

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,850
that you're using a charlotte system

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,970
versus attention to meet blackboard like

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:55,600
for phase one it sounds like I'm Frank

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,540
that wallets will choose whether to go

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:17,430
into the charge system of whether to go

00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:21,750
yes hmm I'm not so sure of it

00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,750
actually yes but

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,030
like you have you have that already

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:33,650
working now if it's a bit transactions

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:42,860
right yes so how do those which are they

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:46,040
having to choose if note wants to send

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:50,030
transaction to accept specific shark in

00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:57,350
my it needs to listen to the network to

00:29:50,030 --> 00:30:00,700
- shut up - are so yes the note the no

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:04,100
makes description at the decision yeah

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:08,890
yes so you can actually choose which

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,890
shark are which you are interested in

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,000
when one doesn't

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:19,049
does that mean it only humans in

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,049
transactions but

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,460
yes

00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:31,149
in phase one we just treat the

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:35,169
transaction data as the data so we don't

00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:38,700
actually ask execute them yes because we

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:42,659
want to focus on the data availability

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,659
problem yes

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,790
any more question

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:57,650
okay thank you

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,650
