Publication date: 2018-05-20
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2018 - Blockchain
Description: 
	Blockchain beyond financial services - what we can do with blockchain that will change the world

Speaker: Gilles Gravier, Director, Senior Blockchain Strategy Advisor Wipro
Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#gilles-gravier3067

In this panel we will explore with industry experts how blockchain technologies, which aren't that new, but were made popular when Bitcoin suddenly hit the news, can be used to develop applications that, while leveraging the technology, go well beyond what people usually associate with blockchain, i.e. financial services. We'll look at notarization, voting, participative governments, community utilities, shared economies and services... We will discuss this with industry experts from the blockchain ecosystem, users and developers alike.

(Type: Panel | Track: blockchain | Room: Event Hall 2-1)

	00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,819
he'll be moderating a panel this morning

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,900
all right

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:21,150
so hello everybody and by non-financial

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,430
hey every time somebody's talking

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,699
blockchain nowadays they seem to be

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,970
talking crypto and by crypto I don't

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,740
mean cryptography which was normally be

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,950
what people mean by crypto at least a

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,360
few years ago that's yeah that's what

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,730
normal people mean by crypto it's

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,340
cryptography thing is today everybody

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,770
uses crypto for crypto currencies and

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,850
then crypto mining and then all the

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,030
things we're not going to talk about

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,610
today right so let's get this over

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,320
crypto currencies I SEOs trading

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,260
cross-border payments remittances I've

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,910
said it that's it for the day we're

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,350
gonna be talking about a whole lot of

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,869
different things so I've asked for the

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,479
four panelists to come here with me and

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,810
discuss their experience in working on

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,740
projects that are not strictly related

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,680
to payment using the blockchain right if

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,810
you're aware of how a blockchain works

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,439
you can you can use that as a database

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,509
that allows a group of people entities

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,900
that don't necessarily trust each other

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,000
to work in a trusted manner between each

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,979
other nevertheless and that trusted

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,439
manner allows all kinds of interesting

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,090
applications way beyond the pure

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,770
financial world that's what we're going

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,820
to talk about today so let me

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm gonna be doing a little bit of

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:50,979
reading here so in no specific order but

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,530
the one that I wrote the stuff in the

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:58,689
first one will be Shankar Satish and he

00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:01,030
leads where is Shankar please come up to

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,979
the stage Shankar leads the AI and data

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,840
science efforts at menu life's research

00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:07,899
lab in quantitative investment

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,030
management and insurance insurances

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,000
interesting and we're not gonna be

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,349
talking too much about investment right

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,480
before this he was a computer scientist

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,860
at a kid in academia and at startups

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,079
where he built AI and machine learning

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,920
systems for the autonomous robotics and

00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:26,319
manufacturing industries so I'm counting

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,030
on him to share some experiences in in

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,220
particular in the use of AI and things

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,549
like that and possibly how it links to

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,760
to blockchain the second speaker

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:39,160
panelist will be the named Mohan and he

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,049
is a management consultant by trade and

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,810
currently leads consensus in Singapore

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,340
and in my in the wider APEC region he

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,440
specializes in delivering enterprise

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,900
great strategy and operations and has

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,280
worked for global clients in a number of

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,299
locations and industries I'm hoping a

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,739
lot of those are not finance industries

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,329
and he's a keen admirer of all things

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,069
decentralized and working to enhance the

00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:07,569
blockchain ecosystem and economy in

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,639
Singapore so welcome next one is Calvin

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,139
Cheng and he's a full-stack software

00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,400
engineer with a current interest in data

00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,389
science and distributed ledger

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,329
technology

00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:18,250
he helps SG innovate to government back

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,610
venture capital fund with talent hunting

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,950
using data and software in his own time

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,500
to design and build all kinds of mobile

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,740
and web apps for fun and profit their

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,180
current work involves revolves around

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,010
DLTS

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,410
anybody what a No Deal tea or not

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,120
comfortable with the term DLT we're not

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,550
talking just blockchain here right you

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,850
know hash graphs and things like that

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,800
so the his work revolves around elts

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,190
like hyper ledger in the fabric quarter

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,180
hash graph and I have a microphone ooh

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,550
by okay yeah but that's one of the four

00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:00,010
ones of my panelists so I still have an

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:02,860
issue and if we can have one more we

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:07,270
only have four we will do time sharing

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,850
with the microphone if we can only have

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:14,130
four well handled right we'll do load

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,690
balancing okay the last one is Jonas

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,669
from Denver so he holds the diploma in

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,180
computer science and Japanese studies

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:24,130
from the University of Bonn his main

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,930
focus topics are metadata and data

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,370
quality as well as neural networks

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,900
within Damer

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,060
where he currently works he previously

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,770
was in in lead architecture roles for

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,200
finance systems and various leadership

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,240
positions he's taken a keen interest in

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,690
new technologies and the open source

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,070
movement in his current role he's

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,300
shaping the blockchain and DLT

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,979
activities from the technology

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,750
perspective was Daimler as a member of

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:48,490
the Governing Board of the hyper ledger

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,090
he's also representing that role

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:56,550
internationally okay so so thank you

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,650
very much

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,810
so what I want to do we're not a huge

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,490
Oh we're going to try to make this as

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,790
interactive as possible let me first

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,229
distribute microphones and yonas

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,850
probably will share microphone because

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm sitting next to you if that's okay

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,110
all right so I have a few questions that

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,240
I wanted to ask the panelists but more

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,820
importantly if you guys have questions

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
just raise your hand and and shop the

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,290
question will repeat it for recording

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:33,270
purposes and and we'll we'll tackle that

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:35,699
first but the first one I have is this

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,610
block has become has blockchain become a

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,979
buzzword do are people doing blockchain

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,940
because you know because it's blockchain

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:48,030
I if I look at the companies that I work

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,850
with roughly 80% they're doing

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,960
blockchain because everybody else is and

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,020
and they don't really know what it's

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,120
going to bring them so that's kind of

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,740
the buzzword type thing I have about 10%

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,350
of the people who are doing blockchain

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,669
that have a reasonable idea of why

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,139
they're doing it and they're doing it

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,180
because they're already doing some

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,770
existing process but they want to

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,800
optimize it they want to make it faster

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,900
cheaper more secure disintermediated and

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,630
that's how the the computer industry has

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,550
been working for the last 50 years right

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,560
every time there's been a new revolution

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,289
when we went from datacenter well

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,700
mainframe to client-server all the

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:27,810
system integrators had a field day

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,700
moving everybody to to client server

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,599
then when we went to from client server

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,789
to distributed we did that a we went we

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,760
had also the workstation phase remember

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:41,830
workstations right they're dead now

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,069
then we

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,110
great we and the next revolution is IOT

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,419
okay but right now we're at the

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,659
blockchain space which is going to power

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:55,270
the IOT world so that's those 10% and

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:57,550
there's the last group of 10% who are

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,770
doing blockchain to change the way the

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,810
world is going and these people are

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,629
really exploring blockchain to create

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,220
new ways of doing business new business

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,340
models new applications that are not

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,229
possible without a blockchain right and

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,830
these people sometimes they're doing

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,849
this project on a blockchain just

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,440
because they know that they'll get

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,150
funding for it because of the word at

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,099
the buzzword aspect but I'd like to ask

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,300
my panelists if they see that as well

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,300
and how they feel

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,670
answered people it's not the right case

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,460
there are the cases really think yes

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,650
there would be a use case for blockchain

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,380
and there are those cases where it was

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,940
first thought and even thought the topic

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,789
is so stupid you cannot do it and then

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,039
after a few discussions a few days they

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,990
wait a second there is a thing to it and

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,450
I've done something and maybe you can

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,220
also apply that topic to this so it's a

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,710
very interesting time at the moment and

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,100
it's a buzzword yes you can do a lot

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,160
with it

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,850
yes will it save the world maybe in some

00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:01,760
parts will it change the world probably

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,760
but will it change all cases now

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:33,430
in the suggest and a lot of them are

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,430
reading apps in communities and places

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:46,520
interested to continue when I ask them

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:48,650
one oh we need our marketplace and I

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,220
said do you really need token for your

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:56,230
marketplace they will say well that's

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,230
one to be trying that's one way

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:47,530
yeah it's always interesting to have the

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:50,140
conclusion is always hey actually it's a

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,800
interesting use case to use open our

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,120
marketplace

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,780
and we see that way to waste cheap

00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:01,120
funding and we are not out there for

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,720
cash back and like the rest of people

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,510
there it's all in our conscious I'm

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,550
wondering who are the ones that are

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,820
going to protect that because everybody

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,820
says

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,670
so

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,950
and for me

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:44,910
so for me one of the signs that

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:48,360
slowly out of the buzz phase is when

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,540
people stop using that name to justify

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,279
or sell a project and just to give you

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,130
an example because that that's kind of

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,110
my segue into looking at non-financial

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,269
applications for blockchain there's

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,680
another buzzword in at this time which

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,799
is really strong in Europe by the way

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,750
it's called GDP R which is the agenda

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,429
and general data protection regulations

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:13,170
for all kind all entities doing business

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,760
or having presents in Europe so it

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,500
impacts the whole planet that's trying

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,199
to deal with Europe and so everybody is

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,030
doing GDP are now and and I have a

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,069
customer that that came to me that said

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,660
we we want to to build a GDP our

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,559
solution that's fine

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:31,290
and we want to do it with the blockchain

00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,600
so you know I take a step back and I say

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,750
so okay a blockchain is interesting

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,179
because we can we can use it to to track

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,570
all of the transactions which will be

00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:45,330
events happening on on the private data

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,980
so for example when an employee has I

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,590
don't know their passport number that

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,780
changes they have to be able to modify

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,610
that wherever it's being used because

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,890
there's right to modifying your data

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,840
part of the GD P R so when you when you

00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,790
want to modify your data you made it

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,320
make a request to the privacy officer to

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,450
the data officer to the HR person

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,000
whoever's your contact and that request

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,650
should be logged and then tracked so you

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,049
should know when that request has been

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,150
sent to whoever needs to process it when

00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:14,010
when it's been processed and then you

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,510
should be told you know that and if

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,190
somebody needs to audit it from the

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,570
outside they should be able to look at

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,710
although transaction and check that

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,590
they've happened in the right kind of

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,780
timeframe

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,630
and and that's a very nice use case for

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,880
a blockchain but honestly you know it's

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,590
it's an event tracking system people

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,010
have been using event tracking systems

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,900
since we have events to track so decades

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,780
and we've been doing that with databases

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,190
actually two years ago I built an event

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,510
tracking system for a bank in

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,940
Switzerland then they were using

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,970
Cassandra to do the event tracking

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,780
between entities right so so I look at

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,670
them and say yeah you

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,940
I mean you can do this with a blockchain

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,370
the blockchain is a nice an elegant way

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,870
to do it but you don't have to use a

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,970
blockchain for that so why do you want a

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,600
blockchain and they look at me and say

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,450
well because our company's investors

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,970
want the company to look at the the tip

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:12,620
of modernity and we will get funding if

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:15,290
we do a blockchain project okay so we'll

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,030
do dois chain right but that's because

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,390
it's still in the buzzword phase right

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,590
you wouldn't hear this if somebody came

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,590
and talked to you about doing a Java

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,360
project 20 years ago people would do a

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,520
Java project because it was the buzzword

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,890
of the day and another 20 years ago it

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,350
was AI and oh wait it still is now

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,200
people are still yeah it's again right

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:39,080
but but we have these phases so what I

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,590
like to explore now using that example

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,300
of a gdpr solution is what kind of users

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:49,040
of blockchain have you seen out there

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:51,110
that are not related to I SEOs and and

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,240
and and getting money or transacting

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,600
money but more on using the blockchain

00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,990
as a as a an infrastructure for for

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,990
doing trusted interactions between and

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:23,480
yeah a lot

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:25,550
fortunately exemple trust again so in

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:45,350
the world where maybe I sell you

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:48,500
something by means of and eventually why

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,290
is it happening because somebody is

00:20:48,500 --> 00:21:09,830
actually getting this kind of invoices

00:20:51,290 --> 00:21:12,110
and fortifying or quantifying the is

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,970
more or less just reading the number and

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:18,020
just giving you the money then we're

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:21,350
just doing a transaction and the

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,190
question we have is how can we what can

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,690
you do about it

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:30,980
so think about an open ledger that has

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:35,090
my name I sign it with my personal you

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,490
know crypto key I say my name this is my

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:41,570
bank account number maybe on a company

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:44,570
scale and and it's open

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:47,690
not only one has the truth but it's

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,270
distributed and everybody shares you

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,980
know the same viewer it because you want

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,610
to have a distributed do you want your

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:58,910
bank account number rightfully recorded

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:04,040
and then if you are going to be to give

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:07,430
me the money then before you look at

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:13,760
this this open ledger and see okay this

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:15,350
is actually and this would be an

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,260
application I think it has something to

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,480
do with trust and it has something to do

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:24,520
with like public information that should

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:29,290
be anyhow somehow recorded its kind of

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,290
LinkedIn account number

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:25,760
as an implementation and what it does is

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:28,480
that it allows multiple organizations to

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,340
write their own notes and very

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,860
identities of individuals without

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,400
needing individuals to store their

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:40,100
identity on central database or even on

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,880
the edge itself so we tested by using

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:50,600
zero knowledge proof and so that

00:23:43,880 --> 00:24:01,850
actually changes the entire me it's very

00:23:50,600 --> 00:24:04,040
promising and a very interesting so the

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,120
world of decentralized Ledger's and the

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:14,150
world of centralized authority like

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:19,520
Facebook and Google is on opposite

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:22,040
spectrums and human race is very

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,190
interesting because we live through

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:29,330
cycles and the pendulum now is swinging

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:32,240
towards the end that's not why I'm not

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:39,620
here to pass any moral judgment but it

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:43,660
is what it is centralized power is an

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,660
equality and right now

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm not here to judge communists good

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm just here hey that's a

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,470
[Music]

00:25:19,110 --> 00:26:35,040
so so so just because decentralized

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,040
doesn't mean

00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,990
zero knowledge proof or identity is

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,670
interesting from the zero knowledge

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,350
proof identity is also interesting from

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:02,420
a DG PR perspective because you're never

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:27,680
getting out private data you're joking

00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:34,040
but you are proving your identity and if

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:43,090
the implementation mean we have this

00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:46,540
even without at work cryptography for

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,540
Estonia they

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:15,480
we have moved from a network economy or

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,480
we are moving from a networked economy

00:28:51,250 --> 00:29:06,700
we can you know

00:30:30,940 --> 00:31:13,600
which is how can you it's the worst

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:17,740
because it's not contracts or the engine

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,650
itself is fine so problems tracking

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,600
identity systems interesting point it's

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,390
just announced two days ago a project

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,350
called virtual poker in virtual poker it

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:32,900
has a tokenization virtual focus focus

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,930
of time gambling has been dominated by

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:39,760
the house percent evasion imagine if you

00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,760
can add a truthful way of

00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:04,679
and if you look at provenance tracking

00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,660
it's it's it's a it's the core of the

00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,670
supply chain transparency type of

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,520
platforms if you take supply chain

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,260
transparency and add a feature to it

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,410
like smart contracts you actually get

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,940
Enterprise automation free every time

00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,710
you track an activity on your supply

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,440
chain you can trigger a smart contract

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:26,240
that will trigger activities and and and

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,190
and sequence your your your supply chain

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,919
this can either be used to tap into the

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,510
ERP systems like ASAP or replace some of

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,120
the functionality so that's that's a

00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,309
game-changer it's another area where the

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,340
disintermediation that blockchain brings

00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:45,110
is challenging historical ways of doing

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,780
things right do I need an ERP system now

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,580
such a complex system like SA P where

00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:54,120
integration with other system takes

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,309
years and or can I just use a blockchain

00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,299
and and have everybody talk on the

00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,669
blockchain and that'll trigger

00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,660
operations too you know for example if I

00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:05,220
if I order a batch of 1,000 phones that

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,530
automatically triggers the provisioning

00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,750
of storage in the next warehouse and

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,360
things like that so so that's that's a

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,220
way that a blockchain will change the

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,660
way we do business and any direction

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,660
between between companies

00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:01,860
which is right so once it's out

00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:38,310
it's interesting to realize that you

00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:43,410
know as a business maybe now you have to

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:46,290
thinking about not just becoming but

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,760
also consider the fact that even if you

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,340
succeed in your set of data science

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,710
endeavor the fact that you are amassing

00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,260
all of this sensitive data I just be a

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,690
toxic liability so the question really

00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,220
is how to use to sort of provide

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:05,090
services and do computation while

00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,090
avoiding this liability

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,560
yes but you can do things like secure

00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,150
multi-party computation which is

00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:19,090
essentially a sub-branch of cryptography

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,400
where what you can do is you can compute

00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,130
functions on data that is across

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,980
multiple parties that are never leaving

00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:29,530
said party and each party having no clue

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,910
about the existence of other parties so

00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:35,560
you know there are sort of solutions

00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:40,200
into prague ravine there kind of cutting

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,200
and it requires a lot of thought

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:05,320
yeah and then keep in mind that a

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:07,210
blockchain while it is a database it's

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,770
not a general-purpose database in which

00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,660
you store everything right it's more a

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,490
database for storing transactions so

00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,830
these transactions can point to data

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,930
that's stored elsewhere and when you

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:19,360
need to delete the data you would delete

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,670
the data itself and you would put a

00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,970
transaction in the blockchain that data

00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:27,160
is not there anymore and that resolves

00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,690
the gdpr issue you have a traceability

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,580
that something has happened to the data

00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,020
and the data has disappeared from where

00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,540
it were stored so it's not accessible

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,620
anymore but it requires them not storing

00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,620
the data in the blockchain itself

00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,130
so so we have three minutes for sort of

00:37:46,540 --> 00:38:02,320
closing comments I would just like to

00:37:48,130 --> 00:38:04,090
okay what's the deal here you talk about

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,620
oh you cannot change the blockchain but

00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:09,180
we're going to pork it because the price

00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,180
drop 50 percent

00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,930
early stages of this technology and it

00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,780
was done with the spirit of saying but

00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,250
we did not invent ethereal for somebody

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,110
to walk away with sixty million dollars

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,030
so there's two things that I think is

00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,950
you know public perception is leaning

00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:43,150
against one is first of all the block

00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:43,150
she did not get hacked it was a contract

00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:54,590
which seems to walk away with the 60

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,080
million unfortunately fortunately there

00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,400
was a moratorium of in 30 days for

00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,090
additional funds because we taken out of

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,390
the system and 48 hours which happened

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:15,470
through consensus by community

00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:19,610
personally I think because it was a

00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:21,920
community it was not the people it was a

00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:29,930
community-based consensus in class

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:32,930
excuses you know I'm not going to try

00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,960
and defend that I'm not going to say

00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:42,050
that that should have never been done

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:47,230
for me feeling bubbles it is not going

00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:47,230
to be free you know its implications

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,050
I'm not concerned about you know the

00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,160
controversy surrounding that to be

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:58,360
honest okay so I mean like I might find

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,650
a little bit weird when you talk about

00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:04,049
immutability yet

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,960
it's just what where's the mutability

00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:08,609
when you can port so maybe that's a

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:16,140
little bit sloppy language and you say

00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:19,039
it's you can't change to compute the

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,039
cause of change

00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,550
and there's another aspect is that

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,070
because it's a distributed ledger any

00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,470
change to the ledger is immediately

00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,330
detected by everybody so you cannot

00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,000
change it in a way that it would

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,470
surprise people and happen without their

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,630
knowledge and that's also a key element

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,190
if you take a traditional database and

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:55,360
unless there's an audit trail somewhere

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,640
an admin can modify a record and nobody

00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,930
nobody's the wiser with a blockchain

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,930
that is just not possible

00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:25,400
communities it's fluid definition of a

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:28,630
group of people interesting

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,100
philosophical aspects in in terms of

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,620
decentralization and we don't need any

00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,840
in ten years anymore and so on yeah I

00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,030
think it will still be aggregators and

00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,130
they think there will still be a lot of

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,140
people that rely on services of others

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,180
and don't want to run their own stuff

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,090
and so on yeah and also you have to

00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:53,810
think of like image ability is only a

00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:55,640
function of time think of if we would

00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,680
have started a blockchain with any five

00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,160
pictures we would probably have some

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:04,660
alternative realities right now yeah or

00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:08,420
yeah if costs we need something to

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,760
travel to whatever or five whatever then

00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,090
yeah you might also have something there

00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:18,920
so it's only it's a mood like true

00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:21,190
mutability is a myth but at least for a

00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,190
certain

00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,100
okay I guess so

00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,660
one thing is clear here we could

00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,130
continue this discussion for another two

00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,750
or three hours and we'd still have new

00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,150
subjects to cover in new types of

00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,350
applications together unfortunately

00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,780
where are you running three minutes late

00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,460
so thank you first of all to the

00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,370
audience for having listened

00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:46,240
participated and to my panelists for

00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,980
having provided such such insight into

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,010
applications of blockchain I want to

00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,080
leave you with some homework go Google

00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:58,790
something called the cicada project see

00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,110
I see a DA it's people who are trying to

00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,800
build a government and stress

00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:05,540
infrastructure on a blockchain think can

00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,250
I trust my government can all the

00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,890
decisions are made my by government by

00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,510
my government being monitored openly on

00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,790
a blockchain with all the citizens

00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,660
participating that's another application

00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,130
have a look at it it's really

00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,280
interesting and I'm not involved in the

00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,940
project at all so thank you very much

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,679
thank you thank you all

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,679
