In this panel we will explore with industry experts how blockchain technologies, which aren't that new, but were made popular when Bitcoin suddenly hit the news, can be used to develop applications that, while leveraging the technology, go well beyond what people usually associate with blockchain, i.e. financial services. We'll look at notarization, voting, participative governments, community utilities, shared economies and services... We will discuss this with industry experts from the blockchain ecosystem, users and developers alike.
