Among all animals only humans show the curiosity for swapping and exchanging goods. This gave birth to the idea of trade which enabled large spread collaboration and pole vaulted us to spread innovation goods and services globally. 

In this talk let's explore how energy and commodity trading firms are viewing technologies such as blockchain smart contracts robotic process automation cloud computing open source &amp artificial intelligence to build the next generation of trading organizations. We'll look at the impact it would have on the skill sets required by future traders and how "brain-power" (intuition) and "computing-power" (mechanics) could work together in seamless harmony  orchestrated together perfectly like Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

oh yeah okay good morning everyone my

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,660
name is tara gujja or I work as a energy

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,290
trading and risk management consultant

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,990
with Wipro technologies Oh coming all

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,710
the way from the silicon value of India

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,650
Bangalore my first time in Singapore

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,289
extremely excited to be here and look

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,109
forward to learn as much and share as

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,019
much as I know with you all my topic for

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:35,520
today is the next-generation commodity

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,840
and energy trading firms and how they

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,500
are basically viewing the new

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,500
technologies

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,260
it'd make a lot

00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:54,870
as part of my job for the past five

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,839
years I've been working very closely

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,109
with energy and commodity trading

00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,809
companies basically to solve their

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,479
problems either by implementing the

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,960
right design approach or putting in the

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,549
right governance structures in place or

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,750
leveraging technology to do so oh

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,439
basically there's a problem in the

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,009
industry

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,780
oh whether you're a crude oil trader

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:28,229
natural gas copper agriculture rubber

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,530
whatever for the documentation to come

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,679
all in place today for physical trading

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,009
requires about a two-week process to get

00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,959
it all consolidated and all in one place

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:43,649
let me take you through a simple example

00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,509
of this process so if there's a physical

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,159
trader he initiates a trade goes to the

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,830
counterparty the counterparty reviews it

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,229
and it comes back to it great a lot of

00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,569
financial transactions finish there but

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,849
the problem with the physical trading is

00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,209
you have to actually move the commodity

00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:03,209
from point A to point B and that's where

00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,519
it gets slightly a bit more complex what

00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,910
happens is the physical trainer then has

00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:12,269
to review a longer form of the contract

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,849
or with his operator and his contractual

00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:18,450
Department and that creates further

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,220
documentation in the system and the same

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,200
thing happens on the other side of the

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,360
transaction that guy over there has to

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,239
do it with his trader and they review

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,030
this clause by closed for each person if

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,450
this is boring then a lot more happens

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,769
all the wrong I won't get into that

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,180
basically and an operator someone who

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,629
actually takes care of all the

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,250
documentation handles about a good

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,349
operator handles about 30 to 50

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:52,980
shipments every month now if if you take

00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:56,420
this as a base report of 20 documents

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,650
per trade or movement or you can

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,209
exponentially scale how much of

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,909
documentation accuracy is required

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,500
and this just gets even more complex

00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,060
because it you have to communicate

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,040
between different channels and it

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:17,180
changes every time so what what do we do

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,459
about this first of all you see this

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,489
Lord of this process is still archaic

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,560
laws and processes in place are still a

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:28,099
hundred and fifty years old and haven't

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,510
really changed much the process is

00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,489
painfully slow

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,220
in today's commodity trading world and

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,230
in the world we live in

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:40,579
it's extremely labor-intensive there are

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:43,129
dedicated back offices which just take

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,849
care of these reports do the settlements

00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,889
invoicing and ensure that you're you

00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,200
have accuracy in information because

00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:55,430
billions of dollars are at stake here

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,919
with respect to every trade the system

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,769
because of all these faults is extremely

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,549
prone to fraud and there have been

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:07,510
enough number of cases in the past where

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:13,599
fraudulent transactions have taken place

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:15,889
it's opaque in nature and operationally

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:21,019
quite expensive because of the other

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:25,400
factors so this this is basically the

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:28,460
problem here before we look into what

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,550
we're sort of doing at Wipro with our

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:36,199
clients let me just take you through a

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,150
small story so there was a in one of the

00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,259
design teams while they were planning to

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,860
build one of the largest store

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:48,229
refineries in the world a designer got

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:51,680
up and said well let's have a goal that

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:56,120
this entire refinery with all X all its

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,099
complexities can be run by a dog so the

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,050
other engineer got up in us whoa what do

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:03,830
you mean it should be run by a dog what

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:07,240
will man do so the designer said the man

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,409
will feed the dog and with that approach

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,440
extrapolating it and bringing in that

00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,800
level of automation let's see what we

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,800
can do

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:26,990
first of all if you see if there was a

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,990
possibility that refineries or food

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,930
processing companies could post a set of

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:37,190
order transactions onto a platform and

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:41,110
then trading companies could auto you to

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:46,370
build could build algorithms which rank

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:48,590
these orders posted based upon their

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,500
algorithm of which they can fulfill and

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:56,240
of course this algorithm will be a cost

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,130
minimizing function oh and yet take care

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,090
of the multitude and magnitude of

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:05,270
economic factors at play the resulting

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:08,690
output would probably spit out a offer

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,820
price for those crude oil posts along

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,710
with the dollar value plus a delivery

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,710
location and specified time and so on

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:21,500
it's possible that the same competitive

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:23,750
spirit will cascade on to other members

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,849
within the within the chain such as

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,010
insurance companies inspectors brokers

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:32,750
vessel operators and so on or credit

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,580
insurance companies could be given the

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,010
opportunity because they could build or

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,979
you could build the credit layer and

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,599
analytics on top of this where real-life

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:45,800
performance of these different assets

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,690
feed back into the identity of every of

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,030
every real-life performing asset and

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,090
therefore gives it a credit score

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,000
thereby allowing you to add a fair

00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:00,470
dollar value insurance to every

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,550
transaction you can imagine a galaxy of

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,770
IOT sensors or measuring quality

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,159
quantity and other specs which are then

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,330
fed into the contractual clauses which

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:16,659
then trigger certain events based upon

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,659
those clauses

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:26,009
if pilots of this nature succeed there

00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:29,039
is a huge potential to create an

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:32,669
ecosystem where one where developers

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,729
could build apps on top of this let me

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,889
give you a small examples for example or

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,389
building a distribution application

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:44,039
where you could you could charge a fee

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,529
from food processing companies who would

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,479
love who would love the data that you

00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,639
collect from users on their dietary

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,439
intake because that allows them to

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,259
optimize their supply chain better and

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,749
you could pass on that revenue on to the

00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,739
masses thereby flipping the entire

00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:03,599
revenue model which we hear of with

00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:06,319
using the possibility of the blockchain

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
platform

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:17,180
of course this won't be the this

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,610
particular use case problem won't be the

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,210
single one it has to be operated with

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,680
other use cases which are being built

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,050
out there currently maybe some will

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,699
focus just on finance some will focus

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,099
just on vessel operations

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,709
ours will focus just on documentation

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,779
and so on and so forth so interoperate

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:42,289
ability between the different platforms

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:44,060
will be a key for success based upon our

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,890
experience what we think are the

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,140
principles for a successful commodity

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,790
trading blockchain platform number one

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,470
collaborative if it's a consortium based

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,420
even if it's open source you have to

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,600
have collaboration among all parties

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,700
within that consortium you should have a

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,070
view of singularity that is all the

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,350
functionality you agree upon before you

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,600
build on the chain definitely open

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,930
source not just in terms of tech but in

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,240
terms of business use a lot of business

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,920
users are not able to transact or move

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,290
or take part in the commodity value

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,420
change just because it's so labored it's

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,959
so labor intensive as well as so

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,339
capitalized of course like any other

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,949
blockchain platform you have to

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:30,380
appreciate be very very appreciative of

00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:33,320
privacy and in this case it becomes even

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,980
more even more important into the

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,579
operatively

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,190
obviously and education I think is a is

00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:42,320
a must need of the earth not just for

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,660
New Age developers but also for people

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,120
within the business to understand what

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,120
benefits can this platform bring to you

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:59,720
being a risk guy I always think like

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:01,579
what can go wrong so primary the primary

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,620
reason is regulators don't play ball or

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:09,170
this they simply don't come up on board

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,540
number two technology limits one of the

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,190
reasons I'm also here is because I need

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,699
I want to understand how far can you

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,949
push this tech to there is low

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:21,050
acceptance of the platform across the

00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:22,200
different business users and finally if

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,180
there's a massive

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,340
I scratch it removes the innovation

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,780
budget which does not let you create

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:33,630
cool stuff like this but want to finish

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,870
on a happy note what can go right

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,140
there's the mass adoption of this new

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,130
world platform the tech continues to

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,880
grow exponentially

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,240
I sing oppose a hub for blockchain right

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
now

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,700
all the cool stuff really happens here

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,540
and there's support of the community to

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,730
build this going forward this would

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,330
result in a massive drop in cost of

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,200
operations making a commodity cheaper

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,750
across the globe

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,850
of course it creates a flourishing new

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,460
ecosystem where developers business

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,580
users come together and build apps which

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:16,470
then build a new stream of revenues for

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:19,170
everyone within the ecosystem with that

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,190
thank you for listening to me and I look

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,359
forward to interact with you thank you

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,359
[Applause]

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:37,359
ah what have you actually implemented in

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:45,749
the blockchain so far uh so we've done a

00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:48,399
pilot for for a few consortiums and

00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:51,459
overall the as a company we've done

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,549
about I think over 50 projects all proof

00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:56,499
of concept and with him specifically

00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:05,499
within the energy place I have been

00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:06,790
involved in three well this was the sort

00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:09,999
of problem statement we were trying to

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:14,470
solve and I think more than that I'm not

00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:16,600
sure how much I could talk I'm but I

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:24,790
could probably one-on-one with you

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:26,410
and have that yeah but yeah the meat of

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,749
the problem is this there are open white

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,749
papers out there which which talk about

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,019
hearing words but what has been

00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,910
implement and what is introduction what

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:46,629
word what are the tech problems you

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:50,379
faced right okay uh well from the

00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:53,069
business end this was it and I'd love to

00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,069
share more after

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
yeah what what are the factors that

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,410
yeah so in fact a multitude of factors

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,630
or work play or to choose the right

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,560
platform and in fact we've still not got

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:36,399
there it's we don't know which one or to

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,830
go with while while our pilots were done

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,230
on few platforms as their certain

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,000
startups who have their own little who

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,720
have their own platform we tried with

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,339
that as well so we don't know which one

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,740
to go with yet but I think we'll

00:13:48,339 --> 00:14:00,880
eventually choose one in the coming few

00:13:50,740 --> 00:14:03,220
weeks oh yeah thank you thank you very

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,320
much thank

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,320
