Blockchain governance is perhaps the biggest factor that explains the current state of things and can be used to guide evolution of blockchain. Blockchain governance, like any similar governance of a complex system, consists of components, including incentives, communication, compliance and failure management. Optimizing each and every one of these factors will give the blockchain governance its best shot to become mainstream, revolutionary and disruptive to almost any industry in the world.

promote my platform a lot of the people

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,319
here presenting promote something mine

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,000
is a conceptual talk so it's not Tech

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,240
Talk where they go into source code

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,109
nor is it promotion of my own platform

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,150
it's a conceptual talk so maybe before I

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,680
start quick question who knows what

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,930
governance in general well there's

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,880
someone almost asleep over there says

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,750
you know so Kay there's two people okay

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,970
it sounds good

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,960
so governance in one sentence is

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,090
basically a way of governing a system or

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,829
platform or something which means

00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,899
analogy a good analogy probably would be

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,700
like a business model think of it as a

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,670
business model or a big picture of how

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,640
things connect how things interact how

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:53,610
things exist in whatever ecosystem or or

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,829
platform okay just two logos some people

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,530
show logos I mean the most relevant from

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,410
these logos here is this one prison it's

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,059
already considered one of the top block

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,140
Cheney comics and gardener's companies

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,130
in North America and Europe we have

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,170
people with PhDs from Harvard whose

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,030
supervisors got Nobel Prizes about

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,830
market design contract theory in other

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,090
aspects of Gardner so this is probably

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,170
the best you can have in terms of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:27,479
darkness so I'm basically representing

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:30,150
them in this region yeah and well I've

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,460
been a startup I've been a coder being a

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,720
start-up twice failed once exited I

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,540
advised in a yeah and blockchain

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,549
basically among other things and I

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,090
helped some i SEOs so a bit of an agenda

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:47,579
so we'll go with basics I think there

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,500
are some people here from aetherium they

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,070
can always chip in and add commands

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,960
because I'm gonna touch on is a room

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,000
some few so current state I'm gonna do

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,399
comparison of Adaro between because both

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,140
are very famous everyone knows them I'm

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,060
gonna touch on some contenders and

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,270
theories and then I'm gonna propose to

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,640
potential sort of futures intelligent

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,150
futures which as of right now none of

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,620
them shows and this is based on the fact

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,760
that I also consult on a die

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,450
in a year okay so yeah by the way if and

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,010
when I want to make it more interactive

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,019
so that audience doesn't fall asleep

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,110
actually tries to participate so if you

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,519
have a question don't wait till the end

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,290
it's a long question wait till the end

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,620
but if it's something quick comment or

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,569
something yeah yeah so if you have

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,099
something quick to say say don't wait

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,190
till the end till it's really late and

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,230
everyone is asleep okay so I'm gonna

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,230
break down governance into three main

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,359
things incentives coordinate so

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,190
incentives is basically owe in

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,260
blockchain you guys call it bond here

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,840
cetera but let's just call it incentive

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,359
a bigger picture name coordination

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,400
includes communication and decisions

00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:03,329
this is consensus consensus forming

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:07,230
basically so in simple terms this is

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,700
what governance is about right okay so

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:14,459
this slide I'm gonna spend quite some

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:17,030
time on so here is the original so let's

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:20,700
take Bitcoin in atrium as of right now

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,609
both are working on proof of work how

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,410
many of you knows what will work oh my

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:29,160
god I'm doing with a lot of technical

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,950
people very good so if you know what's

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,400
proof of work this visual is gonna be a

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:38,910
lot more interesting for you and here's

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,799
a source right so he compares how proof

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,180
of work works and how Bitcoin is there a

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,980
work with guess what any Americans here

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,040
of the I'm not an American has two

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,400
Americans here as well three this is

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,739
comparing with your US Senate so we have

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,959
few stakeholders right so governance

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,370
talks a lot about stakeholders because

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,889
it implies there is a platform or

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,690
marketplace which implies there's more

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,709
than one side which implies how they

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,780
deal with each other how they

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,560
communicate with each other what are

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,019
their respective scientists and how the

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,949
decision-making and consensus happens on

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,810
these systems right so I have a look

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:21,469
very good comparison developers our

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:26,889
developer the Senate they develop stuff

00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:29,050
right this is the Senate part now miners

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,699
the judiciary because developers can

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,289
develop stuff but miners they might

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:36,729
decide to approve or not approve right

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,889
then you have the community that has

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,719
some voting power and you have the House

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:45,310
of Representatives this is basically the

00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:46,779
infrastructure it's a drought so do you

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,569
think this is an optimal system of

00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,919
gardeners I know we have few Americans

00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:52,210
here but do you really think your system

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,400
is actually optimal yours is a

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,819
representative democracy that made sense

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,840
in eighteenth century at that time say

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,340
again yes correct yeah it's a very good

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,620
point it's supposed to be but now

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,569
everyone says it's supposed to be that's

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:13,900
originally how you got incorporated so

00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:16,379
to speak that's right but so what's

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,039
wrong with this picture

00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,810
any idea if something is wrong or even

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,969
if you don't necessarily talk about us

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,560
in it what's wrong with Bitcoin system I

00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:29,139
mean there's few things that I'll

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,830
comment on but what do you think could

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,830
be improved on

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:42,800
so again yeah

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:42,800
that's wrong Provo work is expensive

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:51,689
okay let me ask a question from a

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:55,319
different point dual Bitcoin developers

00:05:51,689 --> 00:06:00,110
have an incentive to develop or improve

00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,110
the system why

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,660
not always but so their incentive is to

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,910
make the overall Bitcoin value to go up

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,280
right there is no direct incentive for

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:19,240
them this is an overall ecosystems value

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,980
going up right has the reason Bitcoin is

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,390
where it is has the reason it the room

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,890
even exists because it was supposed to

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,290
be or is supposed to be an improvement

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,210
on Bitcoin right developers have very

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,900
little specific to them incentive to

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,800
improve miners was the incentive for

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,390
miners in Bitcoin system who knows

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,180
miners get what do they get when they

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,150
mine they get rewards right they get

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,260
block rewards which is taught and how

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,260
bitcoins right now what does they get

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,790
huh they get some transaction fees

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,650
that's right and they also need the

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,420
whole thing to go up right a Bitcoin

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,700
value because that's also in their thing

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,680
but like the gentlemen here are

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,780
mentioning proof of work is based on the

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,360
fact that it works on electricity

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,520
consumption right and people buy

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,930
hardware someone from previous speakers

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,930
was showing the hardware like that

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,860
so do you think and this is a leading

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,390
question do you think miners have an

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:26,070
incentive to move to proof of stake

00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:26,070
placed in Bitcoin huh why not

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,520
that's right exactly they have a lot of

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,350
rigs they spent tens of thousands of

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,100
dollars on the rigs why would they -

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:42,169
anything else they bought this it works

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,520
well for them they go into mining pools

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:48,590
and that's great why would they move to

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,970
view trap proof of steak is better but

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,100
do they have an incentive to move they

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,539
don't has the reason you have all these

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,070
four kings has the reason everything

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,940
else is their right hands the reason

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,770
Headroom is their right so again why my

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,260
saying all of this is because if you

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,240
think about it every this sort of a big

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,430
system has different stakeholders each

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,520
stakeholder has a specific incentive of

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,889
doing and not doing something

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,620
how does Bitcoin improve Bitcoin has

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,860
Bitcoin improvement groups some emails

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:28,990
but does community get to vote on things

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:28,990
that Bitcoin can improve on yeah only by

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,229
correct correct

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,640
is there any direct way for this

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,880
community to vote on Bitcoin

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,610
improvements no not really do miners get

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,459
to vote so to speak no miners get to a

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,470
higher or to decide whether to get some

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:48,110
of the developers to do their version of

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,550
it or not right again why am welling on

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,150
this is because for you to understand

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:59,060
that incentives are very very important

00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:01,010
in any system Bitcoin is extremely but

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,540
really improving the system miners don't

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,450
care about improving the system at all

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,430
at all users don't get to have a say

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,709
anywhere at best part these users are

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,930
the biggest chunk of the community they

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:17,240
can't really push this or that or that

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:21,020
right taken out so reason again I'm

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,160
dwelling on this is because you probably

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,470
know some of these names

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,240
anyone who knows Tasos and disclaimer I

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,640
don't support invest or otherwise

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,529
endorse them I am just approaching them

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,190
from purely conceptual objective

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:39,160
perspective anyone knows tezo's no one

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,000
knows testers go Google tezo's

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,310
pesos is basically things like Bitcoin

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,440
or a theorem or whatever current system

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,139
you take except everyone in a system

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,170
gets to vote on changes they think would

00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:55,269
make sense if those changes like any of

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,759
you can suggest a change a lot of the

00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,470
people can vote on it if it passes it

00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,540
goes into their test net for a while

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,769
then if that works out then it becomes

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,569
integral part of Tesla's moving forward

00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,759
that's one right one system at least

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,819
users actually get a say in how the

00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,069
community in how the system works and

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:18,370
potentially proposed solution the

00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:20,589
affinity is the same thing but rolling

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,410
back so if you vote on it on a change

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,660
that overall a lot of people like you're

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,720
all back and it becomes effective as a

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,730
retrospective time not now so including

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,629
so from some time till now unto the

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,370
future there are a few other systems I

00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:39,670
don't know if you know future key again

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:43,120
I encourage you to check anyone knows

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,009
feature key ok future key is basically a

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,610
system without going into history of how

00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,889
this was created it's a system whereby

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:54,759
voters or people or community get to

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:56,230
come up with values transparency

00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,939
accountability

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:03,880
I don't know trust and then markets

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:07,569
decide whether these values increase the

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,459
overall well-being of that community so

00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:11,290
there is basically value creation by

00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:13,389
people and then there is predict

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,579
predicting markets which are basically

00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,319
deciding which ones are being maximized

00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:21,000
and whether the overall makes sense for

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:23,889
those values I encourage you to check

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,500
liquid democracy who knows what to limit

00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:29,550
liquid democracy oh great what is like

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,550
liquid democracy

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,900
politics fear okay that's one way of

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,390
putting it it's good way so everyone

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,330
knows direct democracy right farik

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,520
democracy means you vote everyone votes

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,070
on everything on all decisions everyone

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,410
there is no such a system current modern

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,150
system probably except in some places

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,490
where they still have tribes right or

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,830
whatever then there is a representative

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,370
democracy I'm not gonna point to the US

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,440
but representative democracy you elect a

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,060
representative who represents you

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,520
whether that representative knows

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,170
anything about what you care or your

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,790
interest that's beyond the point

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,400
representative democracy has a lot of

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,470
problems right so liquid democracy is

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,500
what it's something that's not black and

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,090
white like either the idea is that

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,680
number one you can either directly

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,680
participate in whatever decisions you

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,850
want or you can elect a representative

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
according to their competence their

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,740
interests their values whatever whatever

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,900
so it's like a hybrid and you get to

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,330
choose on these decisions I want to take

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,089
my own vote on the others I want to

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,750
delegate it to someone who knows better

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:41,760
this is called liquid democracy and then

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,820
there is quadratic voting anyone knows

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,580
what quadratic voting so Vitalik

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,290
deuteron came up with one I mean this is

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,940
not his invention but here's a system

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,530
that he's thinking of also small

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,800
introducing on top of whether I'm at one

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:58,380
point the idea here is that because one

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,880
on one voting one person one vote has a

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,250
big issue and I don't know who knows

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,540
that issue what's the issue of one

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,540
person one world yeah

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,839
yeah so correct so one vote one one

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,760
person on what always has a majority or

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,490
supermajority problem tyranny of

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,770
majority if you like this idea is very

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:26,839
old enough this idea is very simple

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:29,029
instead of so because in one-person

00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,180
one-vote systems what you do is you're

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:34,339
voting either I like or dislike right

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,040
it's very black and white it's 0 1 in

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,470
quadratic voting you're voting how much

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,279
you really care about something it's a

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:46,460
great it's from 0 to 1 you buy votes you

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,850
literally buy votes let's say you care

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,220
about whatever issue it is about

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,350
Cambridge analytic issues so much then

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,570
you pay with your with whatever the

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,700
token or the thing is in your system and

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,490
then eventually that gets paid that gets

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,890
paid back to you with time so the idea

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,540
is basically depending on how much how

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,850
strong you feel about a certain issue

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,290
you get to vote with your wallet so to

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,380
speak right exactly

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,839
so some of this are alternatives I

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,480
encourage you to know about them because

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,950
a lot of this quadratic voting is

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,820
already I don't know if you know XM

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:28,250
chain XM chain XM chain is a supply

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,550
chain system based on a theorem I think

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,930
and I think they are already using this

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,520
so some of the some of the other systems

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,360
are being used as well but they are not

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,430
widely known just yet ok so my

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,500
suggestion is again keep in mind I've

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,610
been consulting and advising in AI since

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,040
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,959
and I'm quite new to blogging like I

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,410
guess a lot of you I mean maybe you know

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:53,870
like 7 8 months into this so my thinking

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,930
was that because I know a lot more about

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,690
AI my thinking was that in every big

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,150
system where you have multiple

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,540
stakeholders complex incentive systems

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,550
and communication flows and you can see

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,470
from Industrial Age and I know some of

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,060
the speakers talk about internet history

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,740
but if you look even further down from

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,770
Industrial Age we have been trying to

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,050
open automate and optimize things right

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,570
I don't know if you realize but there is

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,960
a lot of AI in your daily lives and I'm

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,550
not

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,310
King bought Siri I'm talking about

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,770
everything from algorithmic a stock

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,500
exchange trades all the way to how

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,690
airplanes land all the way to Google

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,160
whatever you do on Google and I'm not

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,960
even gonna talk about self-driving cars

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,300
but there is a lot of AI that's there

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,280
that does stuff that humans cannot

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,890
necessarily do at scale on that speed

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,030
and add reliability that it's being done

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,470
right now now problem and to me it's a

00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,180
problem and it's not actually pretty

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,120
like almost by design it's a new thing

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,810
and we're still having a very human way

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,710
of doing things right Bitcoin if you how

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,580
many of you have read the original

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,470
Satoshi paper okay a lot of you right so

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,960
if you read it if you read it carefully

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,430
you probably realize and again there's

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,310
there were a number of other competing

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,740
story papers not at that time but a few

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,020
years before few years after the guy

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,560
didn't realize it's gonna go so be right

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,120
so this was an experiment that that

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,620
mainstream for a number of reasons that

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,650
a lot of other previous speakers

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,560
highlighted now it wasn't made to be it

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,000
wasn't optimized so to speak now my

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,030
point here and what I'm trying to

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,350
propose is that we optimized it

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,540
humans have optimized it as much as they

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,940
can but then we all have our own vested

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,490
interest and our greed and whatever and

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,450
hence we are here with Bitcoin at the

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,090
room has a lot of improvisation

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:47,750
improvement to do as well at least in my

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,100
view so my suggestion was not having

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,450
something like singularity net or

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,150
whatever you know people use AI on

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:56,320
blockchain interchangeably but have the

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:58,550
three things that I highlighted so

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,420
incentives decision-making and

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:06,560
coordination to be done using AI why

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:08,959
because AI can change depending on most

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,560
overall goal or the overall vision for

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,020
that platform can change um without any

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,360
bias or any agenda or any grid or

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,280
anything else that humans have in a way

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,020
that everyone benefits this is what's

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,670
done in a lot more complex systems than

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,900
blockchain it's just you don't know

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,240
about it because you're not interested

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,740
and it's done so well you think you must

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,590
do it because you think you must do so

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,390
well so my suggestion was and I mean I

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,400
even put some generic terms right

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,260
reinforcement learning generativity

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,390
networking stuff because you can

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,610
optimize and change incentive systems of

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,270
different stakeholders in a system like

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:47,450
Bitcoin or a theorem you can have

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,610
optimal market design because it's a

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,830
market or marketplace any of the systems

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,570
are market Pacifica's there's a lot of

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,220
different stakeholders they transact

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,560
with each other interact with each other

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,930
it's a marketplace you can optimize it

00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,410
make it efficient make it scalable make

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:05,870
it really work well and I think previous

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,790
speaker is talking about likes right so

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,010
one of the things I've been consulting

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,560
is gamification gamification is rooted

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,210
in human psyche it's rooted on effect

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,030
and there is behavioral it can't mix and

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,190
what not to make it so if we can

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,130
incentivize different stakeholders in a

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,810
way that everyone overall wins why don't

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,760
we do that we should right so my

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,890
suggestion was that the current systems

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,110
already start thinking in terms of how

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:38,890
we can introduce some automation and

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:41,810
some optimization and take human sort of

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:45,890
human side of it outside I mean boot

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,780
Aryan has a hazard has a blog post you

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,250
can google it boot 18 governance you

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,850
will see he has a blog post at the end

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:55,340
of which he says we think the best is

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,320
that we involve all stakeholders he says

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,260
that that's the end of his long article

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,490
and that's right let's involve all the

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,880
stakeholders but he doesn't have a

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,890
solution for it so that's where you have

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,020
some people some experts who do this get

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:15,590
a noble price on this come and tell you

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:17,390
what to do right so again like think of

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,750
how we can really optimize and really

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,490
make it scalable that's one right

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,540
this is governess to at listing how I

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:30,320
see things now governess 3 anyone knows

00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,970
capture capture now this site does not

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,270
capture you guys don't log in in any

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,130
systems like Gmail Facebook you know

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,470
it's that image under username and

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,950
password

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,930
anyone knows the story of capture create

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,929
one person how many of you are Canadians

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,570
here

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,740
no Canadians only one American guy knows

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,889
about the CAPTCHA story

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,980
okay okay CAPTCHA story if I recall

00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:58,470
correctly and there's a link you can or

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:03,419
you can Google started with a guy Louie

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:05,100
Phan on who he was part of one I think

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,230
University of Washington I think or but

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,210
it doesn't matter with University he was

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:14,070
part of a project that was digitizing

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:16,259
medieval texts and medieval texts are

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,720
not exactly well written and there is a

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,919
problem of someone needs to eyeball you

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,049
know you can have all the optical

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,820
character recognition but the digital

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:26,820
text is not gonna be recognized properly

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,279
so he needed people to eyeball so he

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,710
said it's either I hire thousands of

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,919
people to eyeball copywriters pay them

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,720
millions of dollars over infinite amount

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,210
of time because we have so much text or

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,889
why don't we have this this is beginning

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,809
of 2000 when he came up with then

00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:45,119
Internet is still new email

00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:47,360
authentication we're still fresh you

00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,720
didn't have neural nets that can crack

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,669
CAPTCHAs which you do now so his idea

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,419
was if we put an image of what looks

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:59,490
otherwise illegible three four letters

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,149
to people who are authenticating advance

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,399
adding another layer of security to an

00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:07,950
otherwise Break about brute force

00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:10,230
drinkable user password authentication

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,279
and at the same time we make sure we

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,289
don't Algar it

00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,860
whatever that's input by the user is

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,899
actually 99% certainty correct

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:23,070
you basically crowd-sourced I bowling

00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:25,470
for free now why I am saying this now

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,700
think of it proof of work like gentleman

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,759
there was mentioning you're mentioning

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,220
Pro work is what what is poor working

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:36,179
one sentence its calculation of hash

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:39,389
function does it do anything useful no

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:42,419
it's completely wasting time energy and

00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:44,460
everything else and hence the reason

00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:49,649
we're talking about electricity etc now

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:53,369
imagine if instead of churning your CPU

00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:56,490
or your rig for nothing wasting it I

00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:58,379
always give an analogy I say you go ten

00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,580
floors up comp in floors don't show me

00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:03,380
you sweat it let's

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,450
Bitcoin mining that's literally it

00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,360
people get Bitcoin not because they

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:12,000
solve problems in the world they help it

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,950
because they buy rigs and because they

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,470
turn their CPU it's completely waste

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,880
it's waste of everything my point here

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,980
imagine to have capture type of an

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,230
approach and I can help formulate how

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,820
that can happen

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,470
for proof work proof work is nothing

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,230
wrong with it or proof of stake nothing

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:34,260
is wrong with those it's just how what

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,180
you're spending your effort that's

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,100
what's wrong

00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,830
when Satoshi wrote the paper or when the

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,120
paper came out do you know how he got

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,750
the idea of proof of work who knows

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:49,490
where he got the idea from no one knows

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:54,170
where he got the idea okay one person

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:56,730
anyone has heard of cash cash cash cash

00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:01,260
can you tell us about Hashcash what is

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,780
it supposed to do okay nevermind parish

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,760
cash is this thing came out beginning of

00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,590
2000 I think 2001 the idea was very

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,010
simple there was a lot of email this is

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:13,650
dot board comm boom right a lot of email

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,480
was being used as spam so email spam was

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:19,440
on the rise this guy comes up with an

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,810
idea saying how can we make how can we

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,920
DES incentivize if you like the spammers

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:29,700
if with each email that you send you get

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,260
a cost to your CPU then I cannot send

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,320
million emails because my CPU is gonna

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,120
die or it's gonna spend so much effort

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,860
this is hash cash and if you read the

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,380
first paper Satoshi like a lot of you

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,790
did it says it's this similar to

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,120
hashcash it's not similar this is

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:47,160
exactly that idea his idea was ok every

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,170
time I send an email in email servers

00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,720
you have a little function that

00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,170
generates a hash with identity of the

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,030
sender

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,490
and it's tiny little thing was like 10

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,400
bytes or whatever on top of your email

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,380
and verification of that just exactly in

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,660
your Bitcoin is very simple much faster

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,220
this was Hashcash it became quite well

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,020
known and still I think it's being used

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,240
by a lot of systems but it's not

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,390
mainstream like not everyone uses it and

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,990
again so proof of work came from that

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,620
this is

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,390
inspiration now you take that with which

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,059
at the time made a lot of sense you put

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,770
it in terms of churning CPU but on this

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,720
kind of a scale that doesn't make a lot

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,640
of sense because you're just churning

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,380
CPU you have rigs and then you get

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,740
Bitcoin and there is no incentive for

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,169
you to change so yeah you just become

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,970
more and more you have more Bitcoin but

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:39,330
no one else benefits from that right so

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,940
if you had a system whereby your CPU is

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,890
actually using is being used to solve a

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,590
lot of problems in the world everything

00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,049
from health to education to poverty if

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,909
you could derive a system like that

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,159
where proof of work is actually making

00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,620
your CPU use I mean this is all I mean

00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,820
Volvos issues about open and community

00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,679
and stuff and there are a lot of big

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,169
problems that need to be solved but you

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,539
don't have CPUs imagine crowdsourcing

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,159
your CPUs and you can use prove a work

00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,990
or prove mistake or whatever but

00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,450
actually solving real problems wouldn't

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,220
that be great

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,760
that would be great right anyone thinks

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,250
that won't be great ya know some people

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:25,669
are smiling yeah here please tell us

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:25,669
your argument with which one

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:33,820
your tongue mod folded 4.8 yeah so what

00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,309
I think you're too much folded where

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,870
they found the AIDS enzymes three

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:41,740
dimensions is it that one you're

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,809
mentioning yeah I mean that's that's one

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,510
point so okay what he's mentioning

00:25:43,809 --> 00:26:03,070
anyone knows fold it great you wanna

00:25:46,510 --> 00:26:04,299
talk about folded yep yeah so how did

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,520
they crowdsource it

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:09,820
they had bunch of people who are not

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,409
specialists in this they gave me fide it

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,270
basically they put it out there they

00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:15,669
crowd sir said whoever who solves it

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,559
they made it look like a game and then I

00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:19,510
think two weeks if I recall correctly it

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,980
was solved whereas previously took

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,450
twenty years a lot of experts and they

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,130
couldn't solve it so they found a

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,309
three-dimensional structure of that

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,140
enzyme that was escaping the the experts

00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:31,720
for a long time so they gave me fighting

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,630
so this yeah it's that sort of approach

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,340
right you can crowdsource or gamify

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,500
something for free to you otherwise for

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,120
free a lot of people do it because for

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,990
them it's minimal effort and not much of

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,990
other resource

00:26:44,500 --> 00:27:00,090
okay

00:26:46,979 --> 00:27:00,090
it's called what spank chain not really

00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:17,169
yeah so I mean yeah so now it's yeah

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,049
it's very normal right you are you all

00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,970
should go now check the spank chain one

00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:23,739
you can also check Jesus coin if you are

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,139
Christian or there is coin and

00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:28,059
others now I mean but fair point right

00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:29,950
so imagine if you could have trouble

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:31,419
work designed in a way and again there

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,639
are a lot of people who can help or who

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,440
can design this in a way that actually

00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:37,119
solves problems so you're renting your

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,009
CPU to do something useful actually

00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,389
whether that's for you that's for

00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:42,369
community for the world whatever

00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:45,309
whatever and I have these discussions

00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:47,440
from with number of people including

00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:50,710
some people for material from khyber

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,749
networks everyone agrees and they're

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,340
like so why do we do this that's an

00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:56,649
incentive issue there as well right you

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,080
have to incentivize them to do this so

00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:02,009
anyway this is basically my last slide

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,509
so I wanted to leave you with that and

00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,580
yeah and here is some context in case

00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:09,789
anyone wants to follow up with

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,789
discussion and whatnot so think of it

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,859
this way governance is AI on current

00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:16,299
systems and governance three is even

00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,999
more fundamentally changing the way

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,029
prove of work or prove of whatever works

00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:23,919
whereby that prove of whatever actually

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:27,779
does something useful that's what I want

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,779
you to take away from this thanks a lot

00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,230
yeah you have a question

00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:47,480
consensus achievement is one part of

00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:49,249
gardeners garden assess the overall how

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,259
everything works with everything else

00:28:49,249 --> 00:29:07,549
consensus obviously plays a big role in

00:28:51,259 --> 00:29:09,259
that sure sure yeah that's also part of

00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:10,460
what you are supposed to be fine as part

00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,869
of the governance you are define

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,279
defining that you are also going to

00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:15,559
define what's the overall vision for

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,809
that let's say there are more Bitcoin

00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:19,759
what is that you want to achieve you

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:21,289
define that from that you can already

00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,879
see what kind of incentives you should

00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:25,129
have for different stakeholders to work

00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:27,710
together collaboratively to to reach

00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:40,600
that so you have to define that you have

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:40,600
a very strong point on that that's right

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,019
that's right

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,789
and so the more you can restrict what it

00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,559
is they are governing the more efficient

00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,230
they can really feel in that respect so

00:29:50,559 --> 00:30:05,080
I can you may have a problem everyone

00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:07,119
agrees this is yeah so good point so how

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,289
do you so but what you're saying if I

00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,999
understand correctly is how do you

00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,320
basically ensure that everyone at the

00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:12,700
same time somehow is winning right

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,740
because everyone has their specific

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,830
consensus based on their own specific

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,970
incentives right somehow so I mean

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,289
that's I mean that's the goal of

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,999
gardeners it's not necessarily just

00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:23,799
looking at one it's looking at the

00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:25,119
overall picture and trying to optimize

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,100
that and no one says it's gonna be the

00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,360
most optimal since the beginning but

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,299
that's a fair shot of trying because

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,269
again everything so one of the one of my

00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:36,100
teammates her supervisor got a Nobel

00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,399
Prize in 2012 I don't know if you read

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,409
the book called who gets what and why

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,769
all rows all rose garden Nobel Prize in

00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:47,379
2012 on market design this is the book

00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:49,179
on the marketplace design anyone wants

00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:51,009
to know how to design a marketplace that

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:52,600
has a fair shot of winning you should

00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:56,019
read that book it's about kidney markets

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,490
the guy designed analog it's not like he

00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,470
has a platform he designed kidney

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,909
markets which are very it's I mean if

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,669
you read that book you can see everyone

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:05,139
has very specific incentives a lot of

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:07,240
them are completely contradictory to

00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:08,740
each other no one has any steady

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,450
communicate I mean their communication

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,730
flows but it's also broken and he

00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,279
designed what became a very optimal

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,190
system car Nobel Prize for that so again

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,619
what I'm saying is because like there

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,029
are ways of designing markets there's a

00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,649
lot of systems here is thinking about

00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:24,820
this right so you can look at a big

00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,399
picture and design something that's

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,990
optimal for everyone not just for one

00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:31,899
everyone has their own respective

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,549
incentives and relevant consensus on

00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:35,110
decision making system but how do you

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:37,149
make everything work together is what

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,850
governance is supposed to do otherwise

00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:41,499
it's this right because right now we are

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,779
at the very beginning stages both for a

00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,970
derailment Bitcoin and everyone has this

00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,590
very narrow picture of their own

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,659
incentive their own thing right that's

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,879
why and I mean that's normal it's still

00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,559
new right so what I'm suggesting is the

00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:59,019
next on the next step on top of that

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,019
rose because we get very real correct

00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,139
kind of alluded to it but I think one of

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,940
the critical properties remain is going

00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:08,210
to be successful in the last is the

00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:13,340
concept Nicolas tell a bicycle yeah

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:14,450
correct the skein and again yes correct

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:21,470
you have to have the skin in the game

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:23,149
correct yeah correct

00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,769
unday but almost by definition you have

00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,240
to have all of them have the skin in a

00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,559
game of the bigger picture otherwise

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,330
they are not gonna work together yeah

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,580
but that's that's what we help for

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,919
that's what we help with thanks a lot

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,590
I'm here in case anyone has any other

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,550
questions

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,550
