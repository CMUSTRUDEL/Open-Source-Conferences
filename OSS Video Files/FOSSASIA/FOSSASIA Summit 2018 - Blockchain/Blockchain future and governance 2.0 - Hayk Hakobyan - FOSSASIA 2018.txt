Blockchain governance is perhaps the biggest factor that explains the current state of things and can be used to guide evolution of blockchain. Blockchain governance, like any similar governance of a complex system, consists of components, including incentives, communication, compliance and failure management. Optimizing each and every one of these factors will give the blockchain governance its best shot to become mainstream, revolutionary and disruptive to almost any industry in the world.
