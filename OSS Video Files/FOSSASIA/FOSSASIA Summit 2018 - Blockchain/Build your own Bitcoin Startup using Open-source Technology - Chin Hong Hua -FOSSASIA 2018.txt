Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is taking the financial industry by storm.

At the heart of this currency is an open distributed ledger for efficient transaction management called Blockchain.Bitcoin startups are rapidly emerging in the financial industry and some are going to hit the jackpot of success.Various Open-source technologies including NodeJS and REST-based API facilitate the operations and processes of Bitcoin startups. In this track the solution architecture of a fictitious Bitcoin startup will be introduced using a presentation in-depth application code walkthrough and a mobile app test-drive using a live audience. 

Hopefully this track will yield ideas that will inspire the next big Bitcoin startup!
