Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#chin-hong-hua3112

Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is taking the financial industry by storm.

At the heart of this currency is an open distributed ledger for efficient transaction management called Blockchain.Bitcoin startups are rapidly emerging in the financial industry and some are going to hit the jackpot of success.Various Open-source technologies including NodeJS and REST-based API facilitate the operations and processes of Bitcoin startups. In this track the solution architecture of a fictitious Bitcoin startup will be introduced using a presentation in-depth application code walkthrough and a mobile app test-drive using a live audience. 

Hopefully this track will yield ideas that will inspire the next big Bitcoin startup!

	00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,000
so we have two pieces of software that

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,440
we were introduced today one is already

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,269
a mobile application platform on our HP

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:18,180
I kind of training an irishman if you're

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,789
interested Tom after this about aspects

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,369
of Irish method you may want me to talk

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,800
a little bit more about red tree skill

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,769
API management that one this came from

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,349
acquisition not too long ago you may

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,410
have their own API management so this is

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,809
the dimensional platform both of them

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,440
have a similarity a common similarity

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,360
refused try a few treats including

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,850
number one is open source number two is

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,410
built on top of redhead over chip right

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,070
so you could potentially run this on

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,860
open chip

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,440
online which is our public pass which

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,829
you could just simply go to open shift

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,550
on calm I do believe that's accessible

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,430
to Wi-Fi modems you can set up on the

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,430
town right now while I speak and I start

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,260
using it you can also install this on

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,460
premise so in other words it's like a

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,750
hybrid club installation so what you do

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,939
is just install cloud in your data

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,479
center start using it so if you use this

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,259
as with LGBT PTC's infrastructure this

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,939
is what it looks like

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,330
remember called sign for the primary

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,759
data matter the GPD BTC resells the data

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:32,180
and accesses the data through something

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:35,310
called REST API represent our

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,500
representational state transfer so you

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,610
may have a lot of web services that's

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,560
not going on the stop

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,119
so web service is a still around it's

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,520
just that the VOC and book version or

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,759
addition or read power of Web Services

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,659
is now rest so if you are using all guru

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,689
WSDL that's still around I'm not sure

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,770
how long but the oxide burn extends

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,570
beyond the own enterprise to recipe

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,120
behind so they're all partners and

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,090
then this could just acquire so just

00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,229
consume a real-time Bitcoin data through

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,720
REST API

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,510
so if three scale API management

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,950
platform provides plugins and gateways

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,260
so you might be thinking all right

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,390
you're answering big names like mobile

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,640
at that moment tree silhouettes the open

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,270
source stuff true scale API management

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,380
platform is built on top of a web

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,610
high-speed high performance web server

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,950
nginx a partner already nginx if you do

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,940
know a bit off the history of elements

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:43,170
is built by do I you know online multi

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,440
and intensely multiplayer games the

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:50,700
coolants are beyond going anywhere so of

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,690
us others belonging may be C++ it was

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,570
really look like it looks like suppose

00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:00,000
so valuated for the one point is

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,130
comprised of the entire API management

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,620
platform later on in the day I'm going

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,800
to be seeing things like integration

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,370
routes which we affectionately call it a

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,830
a PCAST if you had cast those have lower

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,670
modules underneath powering it and of

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,180
course it's build on OGS powered by a

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,019
node.js runtime running on top irishman

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,510
mobile so if you would look at new

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,519
services you want to aggregate your

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,680
aggregate on top of this infrastructure

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,370
using them so all of which would be

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,750
consolidated on top of this and

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,180
rubberband GX I mentioned already in

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,170
case you want to customize the proxy add

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,970
more plugins in there pick up lower

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,410
lower technical manual inside coding

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:54,299
right okay so when I develop this

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,250
together with a colleague the same the

00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,430
gentleman's name is avi from

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:07,230
Philadelphia you see this particular

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:10,150
and Twitter address getup address so the

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,129
first stage we built a plan app that

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,610
connects the correct pretty much they

00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:19,449
are using a nodejs module known as a

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:23,139
Fitch and that's your heard of half a

00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:27,720
chip it really is a short form for the

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:31,960
upstream project for Reddick of Henry

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:36,940
named after because the engineers for

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,740
early finds Irish spot not curly and

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,340
this not went Olympics

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,530
I think there was a really good player

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,770
but anymore Henry so they named the

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,410
upstream now the next phase was to area

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,139
bad service what is that best its mobile

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:58,240
as a service it is basically a rest

00:04:53,139 --> 00:05:00,460
service exposed in a village in that

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,759
you're properly business logic on top of

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,849
the cloud app a REST API so and that

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,830
service is a connector ourselves into

00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,419
the cloud world all right

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,849
typing of course did all this on white

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:16,630
podium he said filly onions about the

00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:18,190
collaborate over of his calls and we did

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,590
we did a bit of work morning I mean make

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,770
sure he he got a snapshot of this so we

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:30,250
know what ago okay but get closer to the

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:32,650
demo again remind ourselves that we

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,510
could do a lot we could basically extend

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,060
this use case of payment processing in

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,130
the future no thanks to technology

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,330
angles to technology like and that

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,639
services the fact that g.skill mobile

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,090
I'm sorry tree skill API management

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,729
platform is all about rest services

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,910
aggregation if it would actually extend

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,260
to multiple kinds of

00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:00,320
services built more multiple mobile

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:05,090
friends as well so are not good with ass

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,740
and some of these commands you might

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,730
wanna take a photo it could type it into

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,830
your period and open up this homework

00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:16,370
what we have some time to run through

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:20,630
saw the curl commands a positive one the

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,570
best ways STP is is through crow see URL

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:28,420
if you want to call it

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:32,090
anybody not use this before okay crow or

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:36,170
some of the other online HTTP test tools

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:38,450
are pretty neat I got curlizer by so you

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,700
could crow commands a person one being

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,310
and that would be use is already met of

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,850
baked into my mobile app you can

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,180
retrieve blocks and transactions the

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,560
blockchain

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,110
as of now thanks to block side where I

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,450
could get a couple of Bitcoin

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,790
transactions using a llama command and

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:04,190
you're gonna have a known address such

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:07,220
as this question goes to you and you can

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:12,470
also get the hot now or rather the block

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:15,320
based on the height of the chain I'm not

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,280
gonna go into definitions in Bitcoin too

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,890
much that's thought that you and have a

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,560
research on like exactly what is height

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:29,060
and what hungry games or what attributes

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,270
a Bitcoin transaction okay so why would

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,240
you or as a Bitcoin startup look into

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,919
things like API access control what I

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,080
answer is simple people that don't pay

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,800
they don't get access right I mean

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,350
money-making

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,570
right this is all our profits so if they

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,960
don't buy the right solution for their

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,080
utilize all these transactional quota

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,530
for a month and it's time to shut them

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,510
out I'm gonna show

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,640
there's also building a metric so you

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,860
could get invoices cool invoices at the

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,880
end of the month or a billing cycle so

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,550
you tell all the GBT BTC science this is

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,350
how much you have been incurring and of

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,940
course I keep mentioning this and

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,490
probably mention it to death today

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,110
proxy layer allows educational services

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,810
that's important because it's all about

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,420
growing though you're extending your

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,520
reach in the ecosystem

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,970
growing your crap or street cred with

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,310
the ecosystem building relationships

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,100
right so yeah let's get to the demo so

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,140
two aspects of what you want to do and

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,760
within this depth the scope of this demo

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,850
is the look from a perspective of a

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,160
mobile app developer which is all the

00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,630
more like using the client you might

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,280
want to go from the integration at the

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,180
text view because the person really

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,060
looks at the proxy layer and on behalf

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,730
of the business the guys that wanna

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,040
forecast do their investors on the

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,430
ventral cap companies and that's the

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,010
node the growth plan for the next five

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,590
to ten years and the growth plan really

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,110
writes on our proxy layer right if you

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,730
know that you can scale because the

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,680
infrastructure skills you got a piece of

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,600
mind this is a screenshot of the tool

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,390
called mobile app developer are an

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,340
authority mobile app platform used by

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,070
the mobile app developer as you can see

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,990
from the three layer view early on phase

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,030
two remember that we had client you know

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,950
comment and correct

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,980
runs the business logic and process that

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,750
layer interface to the rest of the world

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,000
the and that service you get them all in

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,970
one for you now if it would help me out

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,780
just really pop a deal in this I want to

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,910
get the audio version do a QR code scan

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,640
and download the app now otherwise we

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,250
just go to using a web browser and I

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,970
know and also as you some of us use

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,160
iPhones

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,860
I know I got both Andrew and I

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,410
this will not work with your iPhone yeah

00:09:51,860 --> 00:10:01,850
hey I went cheap I did not get that

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:07,460
Apple Developer subscription Zoe no and

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:10,370
so I see sure I should follow okay so in

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:14,690
case you're using a phone that does not

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,910
support the Android build this is a drug

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,020
bill by the way

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,550
step open your web browser and go to

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:26,889
people got red head on cop /h n / false

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:29,360
BTC okay

00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:33,500
this view or aisle is just gonna be due

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,209
to the same episode you can just yell

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,949
out don't keep going these are

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,259
screenshots of tree skill API management

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,389
that was going to be better but this

00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,920
didn't see open it it's not - body it's

00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,139
got all the cool stuff that you would

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,199
need from the business side of things to

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,240
know how much a utilization or all that

00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:53,329
good juicy bitcoin information financial

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,430
information data that the only clientele

00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,449
has been consuming and an individual

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,930
level they can individualize dashboards

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,379
all right

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:06,759
oh yeah before that all these are the

00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:09,709
integrations as really ostbc here i

00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:13,069
absolutely they go I included a URL

00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:16,250
pattern which is basically broke cipher

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:19,220
way of calling the block cipher a REST

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,769
API just put it in again keep on ending

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,579
in as many of these URL which we call

00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:27,379
having cast and it will extend it in the

00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:29,870
difference rest services today box

00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:33,079
either tomorrow knows right all right

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,920
there already everybody accessed that

00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:40,009
app if you seen it already okay so go

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,480
test-drive that app and then if you have

00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,660
your own mobile computers it will verify

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,660
some stuff you verify the fact that you

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,689
know the same URL also critical I built

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,699
into the mobile app which is basically

00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:55,100
accessing the top different aspects of

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:58,189
the website for REST API retreats the

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:02,149
real data it's not it's not fake it's

00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:04,220
not a sandbox environment where it

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:08,150
doesn't go out into the internet world

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,930
it has actually query block cipher

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,930
data

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:21,270
okay this is what it looks like I was

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,280
testing it all right so what cool

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,070
feature is Bitcoin wallet so you could

00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,980
actually create your models so you're

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,740
gonna see a messy messy list of water

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,460
names these are the common water name so

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:40,050
if you want to be sure that you are able

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:41,700
to disable the world and create a wallet

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,540
and they will show up in this list

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,020
oh I'm creating some really a new boss

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,680
Asia

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:53,190
so we said force be with you was that

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,060
okay yeah this was from this is from

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,710
early early early days so yeah check it

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,630
out so the next link you might want to

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:07,050
check opportu my thing this is not

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:08,520
exactly Bitcoin right yeah let's hold on

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,000
a second until I get to the source code

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,280
go type in in this field your favorite

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,290
or the name whitespace included okay

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,230
with that I think it doesn't limit you

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,620
or any kind of special characters do me

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,070
a favor

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,420
we had a phosphate you put it with put a

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,280
relationship with Foss agent in that

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:34,310
name okay so if you have a good same

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:36,470
boss either Bitcoin

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:41,530
tract

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,530
right TC very easy

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,580
so I'll show you the API shall be now a

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,040
few things that you wouldn't know it

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,560
especially you could do a crew command

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,320
or you could do the equivalent of curl F

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,210
so you shall be using a process now what

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,520
are they dress client over the view one

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,720
we don't need to do screenshots or for

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,780
that that's messed up right

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,980
what they do is select them and copy and

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,170
paste just to show you that yes it's no

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,820
real data so you could type the same URL

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,160
that you have seen in commenting on your

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,350
slides in here and you get the latest

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,510
bitcoin Gator this is actually exact

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:24,570
same block cipher see this the entire

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:28,120
concept of GPT PDC this fictitious

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,220
startup the rights over these rest

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,080
periods this URL homes

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,990
so information that I would need

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,180
including height and hash previous hash

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:42,010
key account and stuff the counts will

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,990
all appear as you have access to the

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,020
Cordillera from outside okay

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,180
so if you were to know how to query pop

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:55,170
cipher and here is the Box I for REST

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,170
API which I research and from effect

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:01,330
spattering selection or something it is

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:04,660
so rich right so I went that much time

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:07,060
to do everything for all the api's I

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,430
selected a few I select the one from the

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:14,620
water API section the pub chain section

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,060
do believe I did a transaction API one

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,510
would you be test up right now I think

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,550
it's certainly right and from there you

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,170
are able to get either and deals like

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,700
this sorry about lying

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:30,700
that's that out there on okay so again

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:33,130
quite all this information like what are

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,950
they dress because those are parameters

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,850
that you

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,250
oh yeah the five minutes is all you give

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,680
me talk all day about this not enough

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:48,260
time so what happened to that one that I

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:51,650
created and it sure Oh boss is my

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,420
Creator it was a bit contest Oh r-right

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,640
that's for me buying upon the edge of

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,400
the contract nice

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,080
what else did you test you test the

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,330
blockchain I'm going to show you the

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,820
tree skated by shortly with the second

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,890
option but what you just saw earlier on

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,860
a minute ago when I use the browser to

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,340
query the current tail end of the

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,230
blockchain

00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,170
you probably get this am i right you

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,790
test that out I wanted to get yo

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,790
nobody's got curly I can't know it just

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:24,700
go here just you gotta sing just compare

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:29,570
the hash 6hu see that's the tail and

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:32,240
succeed to see is that it now we just

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:35,900
moved again yeah this is real data so we

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,450
could keep oh yeah just keep updating

00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,550
because why this is a tailor and

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:46,030
abolishing this is real these people out

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:50,600
there who do yeah road they buying

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:53,390
bitcoins okay how do I build it this is

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,960
the tool called right hand mobile app

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,280
platform but we will we don't want to

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,220
cause the enemy because this is the

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,329
downstream cutter I'm not signing

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:10,400
yourself upstream so if you go to feed

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:12,170
Henry topology as we feed you'll get a

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,300
source code as well when you get it I

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,160
think you have a link to the get up repo

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,709
which you can it anything stop

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,660
building a good of the entire tool good

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:25,250
luck but why do that when you can

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:29,180
already start using a product from Red

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:31,220
Hat but anyhow the tool comes with an

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,000
app preview that's fine you can already

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,830
tested I did a lot of testing on

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,710
the right hand side of their screen just

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,929
want to show you some of the source code

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,270
so this was the next on HTML the one

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:47,440
that you're creating it links to

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:50,320
multiple web pages create wallet list

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
one query query transaction we don't

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,370
like the water creation that all right

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,600
so let's take a look at how you list the

00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:00,370
water so you get this it calls the key

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,200
thing here is a fish club like I

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,140
mentioned you can every pass margaritas

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,120
a path and that's it to the powder so

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,950
where is the club head here we go this

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,549
is the correct just go to the wallet Jas

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:18,880
told you is not no GS I want you so I

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:21,610
call it off big in the location the

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,909
strings to box I prefer this is how you

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,650
will get the query now I have a second

00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:29,350
URL that is URL goes to something

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:33,340
strange look at it's a p1 or a long

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,659
string of digits staging happy class IO

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,460
now what is that

00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:38,049
now remember earlier on I mentioned

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,179
having a scalable API management

00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:42,190
platform the wired up automating a

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,750
triviality services imagine you have

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,270
more and more services right now there's

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,760
just one service going out to the bar

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,740
this service is already out there

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,169
this query is going on with that service

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,730
what is that service good oversight for

00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:56,590
data information right that's all

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,690
financial the integravision I will next

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,940
time going up to a trading app some guys

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,220
are really good at you know exchanges

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,250
and that funk reading platform you may

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,960
want to query that service so if that's

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,539
your business model fine and you just

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,970
keep on any okay will become our RSS

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:19,100
it's too short what else you might be

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:23,090
already testing the big conference

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,739
section though Jeff go see the three

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,190
hard-coded transactions are here you

00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:33,009
might have gathered that when I was

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:35,779
building this it was a different year

00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:40,239
some stuff have changed most of the code

00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:43,369
remains I need to do a different project

00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:44,479
the transactions in the year 2014 which

00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:46,549
is pretty cool I mean this is

00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:50,359
testimonial called cyber or the blog's

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:52,940
me the launching ledger project has a

00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,690
ledger is the beep I mean this is

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,609
nothing to do

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,269
we're not talking about any any laws

00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:02,119
federal laws of the US or in any Western

00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,769
society that talks about the number of

00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,080
years that you're going to keep an

00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,840
archive of this data I don't know if

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,450
there are block cipher is under any

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,609
obligation publication by interestingly

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,279
this is from the year 2014 I can still

00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:18,440
get transactions if you want to change

00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,059
to something else just go that in my you

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,299
might be thinking what kind of mala is

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:25,820
this but this is the demo right so from

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,129
here you could evolve you could say the

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,700
quantity that you need going to form

00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:34,279
your own URL dynamically so that's

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:39,029
something

00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:41,879
but Elmo's tree scaled so why would you

00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:45,539
how would you make money

00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:47,429
well you invoice people all this is good

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,629
you give them one friend but I'm gonna

00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,349
touch you're gonna touch them for

00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,999
download

00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:55,169
you just download my mobile app I did I

00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:57,089
ask you to pay No so nice this is Paulo

00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:59,909
get folks to download a mobile that

00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,919
friend I remind you is a running so

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:04,889
there's still the backend and the

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,979
backing of course is all that rich good

00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:10,949
data that you're reselling I'll be

00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:13,199
hollow block cipher so you can see the

00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:16,289
number of hits from this service through

00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:18,439
three scale API management of there's a

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,479
spike or I was really testing this

00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:23,429
that's a small spike hey this is

00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,719
disappointing come on everybody just

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,479
keep testing and I think this thing will

00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:30,119
spike up I mentioned invoicing the

00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:33,689
invoice on the cycle this is real the

00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,909
money's not Rio I just put Aryan but

00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:39,089
imagine the money could go up so you as

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:42,439
a startup owner-viewing singing cash

00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,439
flow in right

00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,709
good bring them out of my earnings per

00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:51,879
month and stuff like that

00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:55,449
so how did I put in all those metrics oh

00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:57,940
this is how I set it up there oh so it

00:21:55,449 --> 00:22:00,999
assigns me that little URL that you

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,779
found strange was it with a staging time

00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:07,899
Abby cares thought I all if I was to go

00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:10,869
back to block top Jess you see right

00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:13,959
there if that just means that that you

00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:17,199
are alcohol now get through API

00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:19,479
management Driscoll media management it

00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:21,940
becomes like a monitoring engine an

00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:24,579
integration engine with monitoring

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,389
capabilities so that you could know how

00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:30,369
much you'll be making or not making

00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:32,679
right so you could set that up now the

00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:34,659
pricing now it breaks up with the two

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,559
right now it's a setup fee and the cost

00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:40,389
per month it is a really cool part of

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,019
the demo I hope it works

00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:46,509
I've got time I need to troubleshoot the

00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:49,329
original and that would be limits I

00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:52,690
could put down things like a limit and I

00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:54,129
would say if you have a quorum you have

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,109
a plan you need to have a plan that

00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:59,559
comes with a quarter but man's name is

00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:03,039
unlimited if you were to put in say a

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:05,979
quarter that means once you exceed the

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,829
quota as a plan of GBT BTC you will not

00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:12,479
get how would you get you wouldn't get

00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:12,479
any more excess all right

00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:21,300
they're with me now go back to here now

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,360
these two are the same URLs one goes

00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,160
direct to Bob cipher the second one goes

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,830
to three scale API management at home

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,060
first hosted somewhere in a cloud Kirsti

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,290
or a hat and then it gets redirected to

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:41,990
the outside where it gets the same there

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:44,640
you can see that same hash same high

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:48,720
it's just that the first description the

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:54,600
sauce is different everybody went now if

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:58,320
I was to go over to here

00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,950
I was doing it do it forget it so this

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,259
is the usage I say you can do 2,000

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,080
transactions within this hour is that it

00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,809
right detective

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,480
ji Dam is in no no no no no no just

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:15,600
gonna give it to you at what that's not

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:21,710
what I mean we have exceeded it all

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:24,710
right I do the same croak Mandira

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,710
SEO

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:38,470
authentication available if there are we

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,890
exceeded one transaction already I got

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,380
air

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,360
sorry no good error handling scenario

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,140
over here just true it out and error

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,040
occurred

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:53,580
okay so it's real it's real we could set

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,580
limits and quarters back we'll be here

00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:02,650
give them a lot of wood a lot of wood

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:06,700
that's a big number right now I'm gonna

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:11,410
test it out but you know five one five

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:13,210
zero five six one five zero five six

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:18,430
arrow goes away remember the

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:21,250
authentication failure you authorized so

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:24,390
that's the limits and Korra's courtesy

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:28,020
of rescale it care management platform

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,020
metal presentation

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,630
so that's that our boat that we use

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:38,179
swagger as well

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,360
have you ever anybody use it the great

00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:44,299
representation of API so if you want to

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,440
feel a developer portal talk more about

00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:50,840
it I build simple not too fancy uploaded

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,210
you could it could represent the API

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:58,070
that you're just seeing through a

00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:02,570
swinger document view so as to speak so

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:07,429
here's the GBT BTC developer portal

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:11,690
stick on his leg straight away of our

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:14,440
sweater like view shows up you know just

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,440
stop right

00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:29,640
there go so we really test that out all

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:32,190
here just call it Bitcoin REST API it's

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,730
good especially if you have your own

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,919
developer community fans of GP dvdc

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,380
usually will be your potential business

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,780
partners already are and I just want to

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:48,360
enhance what do you have already built

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:52,080
simple little more tree scale VP lower

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,000
baits VP cast modules and I just want to

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,130
build more cooler on it you wanna call

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,840
that developer portal that's fine right

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,440
so this is how it would look like this

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:06,750
is underneath the sauce all the good ol

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,610
JSON just on I really want truly is also

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,960
a little bit to talk to you more about

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,630
the source code after this if you are

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,990
interested and definitely download the

00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:19,070
mobile app if you're not done so okay

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,070
and it from beginner

00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,770
good thing about all this is it's open

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,170
sauce if you want to enhance the mobile

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,900
app client if you do so on your own

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,300
she's a neat trick you saw the editor

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,390
I've had to go to a browser like two

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,900
lines of code actually I was there

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:43,330
heavy that thing wasn't true that mobile

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:47,260
app platform it did serve as the initial

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:49,540
tooling that created the hollow world

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,230
that I use that as a platform built to

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,960
code

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,610
eventually it served as a runtime is

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,290
wrong because it's running right now on

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,510
the club courtesy already and you're

00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:01,180
able to access other cloud services the

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:04,420
outside looking right Mahara is a neat

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,900
trick you can actually do a git pull

00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:11,380
there we go get clone of the entire

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,750
project so what-what would three sub

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,210
projects I will show you their best time

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,940
so you can download all three of you git

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,160
clone also be happy together and they

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,260
have s you have the applicant

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,690
application plan you have what else you

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,810
get the cloud add all three over and you

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:34,020
can just download them through git git

00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:37,000
clone them to your PC and hack away I

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:40,420
think I did put a documentation up

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,130
reclined grunt anybody not used to run

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,310
before or have you reduced grunt all

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,650
right okay all right good as an editor

00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,230
seems makes makes me more confident so

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,290
the thing about crud is that is a really

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,140
good test runner we swear by and the

00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,300
especially in Oh Castle you are coding

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,550
your mobile apps make sure your

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,790
uninstall it has to be compatible with

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,790
your

00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:09,030
AM PM j sy breach that you gotta know is

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,580
a moving target or other it's it's ever

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,930
evolving so versions should change

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,090
especially if you have not touched a

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,670
piece of gopis about six months so oh

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,130
cool right so get the quote from GP dvdc

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,830
to talk more after this I'm almost

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,100
wrapping almost I just can't be so I

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,920
said because logos are so cold minutes I

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:32,390
mean that's me me my man shut up you

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,530
from Philly shout out to many of us

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,110
Charlotte became especially he doesn't

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,420
have a thing about much anymore so yeah

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,080
so get the slides I think in the the

00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,080
links were you just cut that all game

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
alright

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:53,460
one less shameless reminder that's the

00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:55,620
get up repo initially the first kind of

00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,200
is and that is how to give a name so

00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,150
that I got myself accepted that the

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,830
brain has some a marketing event they

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:06,630
like this names or mobile API management

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:09,810
changed it probably the next time I come

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:12,360
back for seizure so I probably have to

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:16,920
be you have to probably have to do do a

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,200
new use case so one part of this talks

00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,240
about the see all the code that you just

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,580
seen as their input in postman

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,790
collection anyone use postman oh yes all

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,480
right

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:32,790
posted good all right Google so I'm

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,740
sorry but now you could use postman to

00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:38,280
do some tests that's cool because the

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,550
way you see the test time today so I'm a

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,310
pianist it was our rudimentary that

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,350
that's right shows crow it was using web

00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:49,620
browser most men you could do a lot

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,930
about planning to do nothing

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,380
emphasizes our we use especially in a

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:57,450
bigger team right s means the same thing

00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,580
I just talked about a minute ago the

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,190
importance of using credit we're gonna

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,940
use grunt when you do it in local

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:11,340
development why would you do that with a

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,660
nice little tool you just see but one

00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,460
thing for sure I might just have you the

00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,010
truth there that's when you get a Red

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,440
Hat guy in the 7l room with a microphone

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,020
he tells you the truth and I I'm not a

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,800
big fan of this what you see what you

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,340
get the test oh yeah so clunky do means

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,220
clunky

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,450
Adam I like a nice editor like Adam G

00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,030
edit if you want right

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,800
getting our local Microsoft code right

00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,200
anyone who's that it's all good so you

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,880
can download and install have a PC user

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,100
favorite either coat away run grunt

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,960
contestant what else and then this is

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:51,120
how you test it I mean you didn't really

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:53,160
put the same test scenarios that you see

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,980
you know I didn't put post them so I

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,870
just do make it easy for you to test it

00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,580
all up alright that's it

00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,920
if you have any questions I'll be around

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,080
for the next few minutes

00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,580
before I go on another track now attend

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,580
thank you Oh

00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:32,220
[Music]

00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:33,989
a Tanner retention I got it so so we

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,759
good there we go

00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:39,059
it's just an emphasize the same thing

00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,190
there so the in retention 2014 I don't

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:44,749
really know a block cipher is under any

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:47,269
obligation to keep data as early as 2014

00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:51,059
right because the movement behind

00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:55,109
Bitcoin blockchain for that there there

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:58,739
is no regulatory compliance with regards

00:32:55,109 --> 00:33:00,840
to transaction data that's hosted on

00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:02,909
their ledger so I don't know I didn't

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,090
really read the decencies of DOC cipher

00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:07,950
so much it's all about chain but then

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,659
again meaning like I asked you where

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,440
you're going but let me let me throw you

00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:16,229
onto the crowd this is like what if I

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,859
have block cipher I'm in a position of

00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:22,139
the already is my ledger to be the way

00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:28,200
transactional data who's gonna stop

00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:30,690
right exactly nobody with it because a

00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,239
lot of trust worried right I think so

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:35,029
yeah but it's just interesting fact that

00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:38,489
I came across

00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:40,529
after testing retesting this every few

00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:43,399
months is that the same theater stays as

00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:44,580
long as your transaction has been

00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,519
committed

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,649
right there is a there's a history that

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,570
she was not get wiped out but I'm again

00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:55,470
I'm speaking on behalf of oxide I don't

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:57,960
know every single dog chained era

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,610
provider out there so maybe that's a

00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,500
caution

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,840
say do you think your transactions same

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,210
with everybody that you partner with in

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,340
the blockchain morning but it's not

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,340
watching yeah it should not be deleted

00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:17,599
okay you thought about how you would

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:21,429
replace block cipher and you because

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,429
that's to me the hard part you say

00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:32,599
directly from watching good point that's

00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,369
a really nice use case might I might

00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,909
want to work on that for the next demo

00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,679
Thanks thank you it is it's limited in

00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,679
terms of functionality right now

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,250
but I only intend the summary of this is

00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,409
I intend to stop new ideas so if I see a

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,599
forum or my we get up before and it goes

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:52,040
on to be a big thing you don't have to

00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,839
pay me any money Bob you really happy

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,720
that you know it happened right here

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,720
today that big I hear any questions

00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:07,080
alright I'm not thank you so much hope

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,080
