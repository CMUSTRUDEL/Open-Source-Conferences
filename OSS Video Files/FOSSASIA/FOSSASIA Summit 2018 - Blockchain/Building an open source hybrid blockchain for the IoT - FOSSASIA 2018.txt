The Blockchain for the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a promising idea. Despite a myriad of projects on the blockchain IoT, few studies have investigated how an IoT blockchain system develops with open source technologies, open standards, and web technologies. In this presentation, Jollen will share the Flowchain case study, an open source hybrid blockchain project for the IoT. Furthermore, to provide a permissioned edge computing environment for current IoT requirements, he will adopt the Hyperledger Fabric open source, a community project under the Linux Foundation umbrella, to build a hybrid blockchain to facilitate such technical challenges.
