Title: Building an open source hybrid blockchain for the IoT - FOSSASIA 2018
Publication date: 2018-03-31
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2018 - Blockchain
Description: 
	Speaker: Jollen Chen
Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#jollen-chen3221

The Blockchain for the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a promising idea. Despite a myriad of projects on the blockchain IoT, few studies have investigated how an IoT blockchain system develops with open source technologies, open standards, and web technologies. In this presentation, Jollen will share the Flowchain case study, an open source hybrid blockchain project for the IoT. Furthermore, to provide a permissioned edge computing environment for current IoT requirements, he will adopt the Hyperledger Fabric open source, a community project under the Linux Foundation umbrella, to build a hybrid blockchain to facilitate such technical challenges.

shall I stop okay

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:21,380
afternoon everyone my name is Jorden the

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:25,820
creator of frozen today my presentation

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:31,189
will be about a whole new idea about the

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:36,079
IOT production so I wish to speed slower

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:39,020
and in a simple sentence I tried to make

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,550
it easy to understand and how also have

00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,350
to gather feedback from all of you

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:50,720
solar frozen progr is an open source

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,250
high production for the IOT so let me

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,040
give you about five minutes

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:59,690
inspirational part approaching so the

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:03,920
process is simple x-ray OT Prussian for

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:08,259
a highway and the the first application

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:13,969
of Road remix AI maybe I can usually

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:16,790
demo in a bit later so as a whole new

00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:20,210
project I mean a project was the night

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:24,770
of from the ground up so it's basically

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:29,000
we you have reviewed papers and

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:32,510
open-source projects especially the

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,740
project igniter for AHA where meaning

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:40,780
that the frozen it's a type of embedded

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,780
system o operating system for IOT

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,780
devices

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:52,549
and the progress in open technologies

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:59,219
means that we use open source license

00:01:52,549 --> 00:02:03,329
licenses such as MIT BSD we don't have

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:06,689
any GP arrow in the source tree so it's

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,360
better for stars and companies to use

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:13,200
the fraud training their products and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:18,150
especially the hot teacher is ignite

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,610
with old open standards and we used the

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,989
web technologies such as REST API

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:28,920
address and objects undressing databases

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:35,870
such as level of level DP and MongoDB

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:43,140
and inched instantly so tree s or in

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:45,660
JavaScript I want to ask you a question

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:54,510
about this issue

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:56,840
did you know why frozen was implement to

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,840
Chavez

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:08,599
the idea is to raise a virtual

00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:14,090
application server runs on a variety

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:18,109
range of highway passes from hyper mode

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:21,409
a high-performance device such as cloud

00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:26,900
servers and your attacks to a resource

00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:29,510
constraint devices so you can steal a

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,450
finger the finger shows that approaching

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,680
framework uses a naturist Java Runtime

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,859
for Hyper most devices while I use the

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,750
jury suite for resource constrained

00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:51,049
devices I means like you don't have to

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:53,980
modify the code to run foreign different

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,980
hardware devices

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,700
so all the Russian system has its own

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,930
architecture and consensus algorithms

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,560
some details can be found in these are

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,700
revealed papers

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:17,370
cirrhosis car has already hot auntie hub

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:25,280
there are so many repositories you can

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:29,570
check our lair so let me put a summary

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:35,250
so although there are already projects

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:41,700
built for vintage insurance appear to be

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:46,400
payments and characteristics there still

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:52,229
no projects denied specific for however

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:57,600
so frozen expression technology the next

00:04:52,229 --> 00:05:03,320
level for IOT Howard with several

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:07,460
futures but the overall idea extend the

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:11,460
distribution or terminus machines so I

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:16,500
do use the word organization it's

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:21,539
because for a projects as in all things

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:28,710
is about data how to generate trusted

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:33,090
beta with first for for AI systems such

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:38,840
as AI systems it's a significant future

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:41,789
from beginning of approaching an

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,099
technical approach is a preparation

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:47,270
system for your needs

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:52,190
I will explain what Sebastian

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:55,500
proliferation and progeny of ballator so

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:59,700
open source is nature if we want to be a

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,940
decentralized systems it's because the

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,680
centralized is impossible if we use the

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,910
purgatory software

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:13,050
and if we have to use trustees or

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,690
projects to estrange private data the

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,430
disinterest matter is also impossible

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,539
so as we known as the scenario is called

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:26,539
trustees computing and the Prussian is a

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:30,600
fantastic idea to be or such

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:33,120
decentralized systems also the

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,500
fraudulent project aims to address such

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,949
issue by building projects for Howard

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,830
enough of title currencies that's vacant

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,990
trust each other without any interest

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:52,620
Easter parties this can in increased the

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:55,139
transition rate among many current

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,680
projects for Bitcoin the transaction

00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:01,949
rate of power 50 minutes or even longer

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:07,500
and for historian or all the time it's

00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:11,030
short by steel about 10 seconds but for

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:16,949
IOT a transition ray it's about

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:20,419
milliseconds so frozen aims to address

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,419
such issues as well

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:32,190
so how to be a 10 it's beauty taramis

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:36,120
machines the idea is simple we remove

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,680
trusty sir parties so at 8 africans

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,210
every census throw in trustytrey no so

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,720
which is called trust with

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:49,290
communications so that's the matter the

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,160
fraud Renato the under air is the

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:57,750
trustee how well we can use um trust

00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:01,500
Rome technologies or Intel graphic

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:04,710
processors the email great processes is

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,740
also used in hyper rate results whose

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,110
projects for a skewer consensus systems

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,910
in the Middle where it transmits

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:19,530
communications the trustees means the

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:23,360
users of code the IOT notes don't have

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:26,340
to get PKI the public infrastructure

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,660
they don't have to use public key and

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:36,479
private key to secure communications so

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:41,190
I will show you the hyper erosion it's a

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,419
solution for IOT to trusted some

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,380
occasion without

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,380
PKI

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:56,100
fortune adopts the public projects

00:08:51,500 --> 00:09:00,240
together with private productions so for

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:05,510
private projects on the author detect

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:09,390
users can join the vibrato Network but

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:12,630
it's a motto the IOT notes and IOT

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:17,880
devices that s treated the fraudulent

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:22,820
occasion can be self organized as a

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:29,870
peer-to-peer network inner ring approach

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,870
by the famous p2p protocol code from

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,770
1921 I think you can see the

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:41,310
architecture in the middle the gray

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:44,010
circle called ivory note the height we

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,630
know is a device labs receive letters

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:52,230
from the public bra train and develop

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:56,480
athos over a peer-to-peer network to

00:09:52,230 --> 00:10:02,370
repair operations so repulsive means the

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:05,280
minor so the hybrid public Russian sorry

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,310
in the tablet version you can see paso -

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,700
layer the path of minor is a computer

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:16,590
aims to generate such Paris and protests

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:20,420
Paris - the production so I will explain

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:23,880
the equivalent in a bit later so in a

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:29,180
you know in a private Russian all frozen

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,180
robes are running the frozen framework

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:40,110
the agitator comprised of three yeah

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:44,100
three layers pattern layer it's wot and

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:51,800
a meter is the broadcaster brokers over

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:56,280
there sorry um I don't want to explain

00:10:51,800 --> 00:11:00,990
her right there so I just put only one

00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,980
finger here for your entrance so the

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,340
fraudulent ops

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,310
TT where of things encourage which

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:12,480
provides a standardized model to

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:17,550
represent physical devices as an IOT

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:22,650
application server which runs under

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:28,320
devices also the Capriati civilians it's

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:32,450
a combination of kunai and servers so in

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:39,330
short this very and it's supporting

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:43,260
peer-to-peer communications um high

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:47,850
protein adopt the high preparation model

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:52,080
a happy production system comprises of

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:55,710
public and private projects one public

00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:00,480
bathroom with multiple production

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:04,740
systems it's because all messages can

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:11,640
serve resistance through an untrusted

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:12,890
channels making leaks the choice

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,570
resistance

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:22,680
so for transmission system it means that

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:25,140
our purity to trust it does not depend

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,059
on the intentions of any particular

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,629
project

00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:35,469
so here is the accordions I understand

00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:39,009
that it's very easy to understand a

00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:43,329
columns but I prefer sliced here for

00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:47,139
your interest and wish to get the best

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:50,279
from you maybe not at this moment maybe

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,279
by emails

00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:02,300
so the underlying layer of fraudulent

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:07,760
user code protocol to organize the

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:11,780
devices in ring approach this approach

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:16,660
if are to reduce the connections and

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,660
reduce the cost of penguins

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:33,079
so how translations go to frozen name

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:37,579
work here is very simple demo so you can

00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:42,379
see there are four short date chunk

00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:47,559
chunk data means sliced data so I left

00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:53,829
him of video video camera there are

00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:58,369
around 30 frames in a sacred so the T 1

00:13:53,829 --> 00:14:03,339
means the first second and T 2 means the

00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:03,339
second friend so

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:19,490
the first second is computed as Terauchi

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:24,660
and that fear of p2p network look up the

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:33,769
Tetrarchy in a DHT the distributed hash

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:38,510
table so for for example code algorithm

00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:47,180
can look up the Secession note to

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:50,660
process or the Trent data and generate

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,660
transition ideals

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:05,040
I don't want to give a more inspiration

00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:08,759
apparent algorithm but there is a very

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:16,220
important denied here called the Konami

00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:16,220
code the anybody knows about Konami code

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:30,959
our Konami code is a magic tree sent

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:38,689
from the public Russian to enable

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:43,620
advanced applications with our PKI solar

00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:48,269
system is called pseudo education image

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:51,660
shows the distribution computing uses a

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:56,370
love war Association technique such as a

00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:00,379
PKI to control SS to network and most

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:03,420
distant projects use such PKI to

00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:07,170
authenticate users pure convocations

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:13,920
verify transitions however as time

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:17,209
consuming so some statics has a finger

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,879
blood are there were several

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:26,790
technologies can repress the PKI status

00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:29,569
$2.00 education so fraud fraud renews

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:33,870
such education techniques to

00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:39,059
authenticate IOT knows so especially the

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:46,309
IOT prussian need to associate notes

00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:50,100
with fast and for Konami code labeled as

00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:55,589
Linda here it's a truly Renton string

00:16:50,100 --> 00:17:02,610
and can only use once and it is Paris

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:05,120
variant like the app is Google or such

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,120
caterer

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,630
so you may have used these herbs before

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:21,780
so rapado mind miser in the papal

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:31,470
abruption are basically is a schedule

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:36,120
that provide a difficult economy code so

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:40,110
the idle T note was associated to some

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:44,160
in translations by received Konami code

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:49,200
and softer tassels but the puzzle is a

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:55,860
street search problem now not a rat hole

00:17:49,200 --> 00:18:00,780
or hash profit so I means that the

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:05,910
algorithm can be executed in IOT

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:10,350
hardware devices especially the resource

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:18,929
constrained devices which with a limited

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:23,850
memory and that computational power the

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:28,050
fully operation will be a pure meant you

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:31,040
can download a wall by paper a broad

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,040
trends website

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,960
and also if the algorithm to Samuel

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,990
translation to a part in Airwalker also

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:48,740
can be find in a white paper in a

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:51,990
website so my time is running out so I

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:56,000
want to give a recap and summary English

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:58,950
shirts you can see in the table under

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,790
website after a current trusted

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,520
computing model and a rice

00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,570
it's a fraudulent idea by using a

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,330
trusted compute matter we can puree

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:17,070
ecosystem of the ten distribution of

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:21,060
Tyrannus machines but the only problem

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:25,500
layer is that we have to use a trusty

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:30,440
hardware and currently there is there

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:35,730
are only two technologies such as Intel

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:39,540
processors and untrusted on IP so the

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:42,390
future projects that things are come

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,730
from Taiwan in the project was starting

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,300
Taiwan we want to work with how

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:52,070
industries in Taiwan or maybe in China

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:56,700
we are setting our office in China now

00:19:52,070 --> 00:20:04,410
to be or a truly brush and hardware

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:07,200
chipset so that's all you can but here's

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,050
my contest you can you can check all the

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,350
frauds and a fraudulent website website

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:18,840
named wrote a taxi or fortune top CEO is

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:24,650
very easy to catch up and if you have

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,650
