	00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,329
but extremely hey I want to keep to

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,329
myself I really don't want anybody to

00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:30,200
know of me but yet I want the ability to

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:33,920
be famous to get great jobs so we

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,379
struggle between these two extremes so

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,709
this concept online I did identity has

00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:42,620
has been a has been a big problem has

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,459
been always there since the internet was

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,120
invented

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,120
and effect

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,880
popular everybody knows about this and

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,130
what that really means is that you can

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,160
actually pretend to win anything on

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,860
anyone without the other party being

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,510
able to verify that right so even if you

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,020
create a LinkedIn profile and you claim

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,930
that you have your very famous

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,120
blockchain expert who the hell knows

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,740
right nobody actually knows where the

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,440
blockchain expert or machine learning

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,520
experiment you can declare so yourself

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:29,630
without any form of chapati proof

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,910
so so that is the fundamental problem

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,400
with internet which has given us a lot

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,950
of information but at the same time it's

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,270
hard to get trust unless through a

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:45,620
third-party organization verifying that

00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:48,230
so identity need to be self sovereign it

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,150
requires ten principles you can read all

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,640
about it by programming at easily

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,950
a few of which are like concept

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,500
assistance the concept could throw over

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,690
your own information the ability to

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,330
access profile access to such

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,460
information and ultimately transparency

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,560
as well because if you claim that your

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,340
blockchain expert or your machine an

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,810
expert and how do you verify that so

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,730
identity is also a topic now as you saw

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,910
as I mentioned it can be used for

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,739
beneficial and malevolent purposes in

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,200
the case of Facebook Cambridge and the

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,970
Ithaca has proven to everyone that your

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,970
data can be used against you

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,470
of course identity also only makes sense

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,990
from a third-party perspective we can go

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,990
deep into the philosophically meant

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,630
allow I think that why I am like any

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,490
other day it is both a philosophical

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:46,500
problem as well as a practical problem

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,180
so here this where things are changing

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,620
right in 2017 which was just last year

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,530
there's efforts to standardize the

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,630
concept of this distributor ID which

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,210
I'll cover in more detail later and this

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,640
concept of verifiable claims how does

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,250
this you know tie in with the concept of

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,230
distributed ledger on the popular

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:12,870
password blockchain data but essentially

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,340
it is very difficult the problem that we

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,560
have right now is very difficult to

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,380
express your own financial information

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,450
your own education qualification even

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,490
your personal healthcare data which is

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,230
trapped in different clinic and

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,080
different hospitals or the centralized

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,320
system into a way where you could throw

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,230
it yourself so the myth the mission of

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,690
this the Nutri see verifiable claims

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,530
working group is to make it easy to have

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:43,000
a standard comment tid I became comment

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,390
which

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,760
consumed and produced but all players in

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,610
the system in a more fair and open

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,450
manner so no one single entity will

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,890
close everything above you

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,470
so the current system looks like this

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:04,120
right you usually have someone for

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:08,110
example my immigration office or the

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,120
book and control office issuing your

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,150
identity to you when you're given birth

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,080
when we are born sorry when you're born

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:19,090
yeah and to verify that someone who

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,390
wants to verify your identity has to go

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,720
back to verifying organizing the issuing

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,850
organization to prove that indeed you

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,669
are who you say you are so this is a

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:34,600
circular loop right now but the problem

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:36,190
with this system is that well in the

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,160
digital system we use this concept of

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,350
public key identity infrastructure to

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,500
stop this problem but the problem with

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,570
this this particular circular loop but

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,810
is that it is costly and it's a set of a

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,410
system if someone burns down the office

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,590
you're a cop that's it it's gone if the

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,380
database the whole solar system is

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:03,550
destroyed what do you do

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:06,310
so this is not something that is that

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,040
cannot be imagined in fact most refugees

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,620
will free from one country to another in

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,100
times of war free without the identity

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,530
because the central organization that

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,490
can verify who they say they are is

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:24,160
destroyed in cases of war in cases of

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,260
disasters so while we are very lucky to

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,750
be living in a developed country most of

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,340
us do not have this problem there's 1

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,120
billion people in the world who faces

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:36,790
his problems in the digital world but

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,790
it's also not something that wouldn't

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,710
happen it has happened if certification

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,570
Authority makes a misstatement issuing

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,310
the digital certificate or the service

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,800
itself goes down everything possible

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,560
yeah you're green with a lock-up on your

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,590
browser that verifies that ok this is a

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,140
valid issue to someone depends on a

00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:00,760
central CA so this is a problem that

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:04,720
people don't think about but when it

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,270
hits you well you have trouble so how do

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
we solve this right so one of the ways

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,140
that people are exploring right now

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,570
which is the topic of hyper legend in

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,430
the and sovereign foundation is to take

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,460
a more decentralized approach to the

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,730
problem

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,790
but there so it uses a concept on the

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,470
IDs like decentralized identifiers for

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,410
those of us who are very used to the

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,470
concept of you your ID the ID is a

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,710
different way of ensuring that each ID

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,570
issue has little chance of conflict

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,360
instead of being issued on the central

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,490
database and built on top of a public

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,250
blockchain we potentially have a

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,230
complete solution to solve our identity

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,810
problem today right which is why I'm

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,220
excited about hydrologic need a bit

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,650
disappointed that no one else has heard

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,000
about it but hey I did hear to share

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,280
updates so that more and more people

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,920
know about this and potentially consider

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,080
using such a system to be integrated

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,210
into your your own application

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,670
whatever you're doing yeah instead of

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,670
the default Facebook log in before

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,150
Google long in a look at SSI look a

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,830
sovereign foundation

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,420
so that's what I've covered so far so to

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,880
most people they don't really care about

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,770
our technical details so we will jump on

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,320
to the next part which is the benefits

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,839
that's what ultimately that they use a

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,240
chasm as techies we care about

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,220
implementation details we care about why

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,870
it works the way what's how it works we

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,660
care about implementation details but

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,700
for most business users for most lay

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,680
users all they really care about is

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,470
what's the batteries if the adoption

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,540
adoption steps are too tedious for them

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,520
to do so well they were still sticking

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,760
to facebook login because facebook login

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,029
only requires them to have one button

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,730
okay

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,310
without even even reading what they are

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,470
okay they will get nothing right they

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,210
want to access convenience and the price

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,240
for convenience they are paying they

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,610
will figure out later right so for us we

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,510
need to sell the benefits of why we need

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,220
to do SSI in a clear manner produce it

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,890
in applications in a simple manner so

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,330
that there will be adoption so that's a

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,990
huge challenge there's a non-trivial

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,990
challenging

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:23,869
so well can I take the assumption that

00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,589
most of you are familiar with blockchain

00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:28,339
because you're attending this session

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:32,219
yeah so I'll skip some of that part and

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:34,799
focus more on what is a decentralized PK

00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:38,699
hi and how every public key has his own

00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,369
address on that ledger and this is the

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:43,709
approach that's taken to solve itself

00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:45,319
sovereign identity problem right instead

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:48,479
of relying on a centralized organization

00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:50,879
we rely on a distributed ledger shared

00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:53,489
among participating validating

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,589
organizations well it is still somewhat

00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:57,389
a centralized system except that the

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,569
centrality has been spread across

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:02,540
multiple organizations I is a degree of

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,970
centralization

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:09,300
so this public specification also by the

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,850
w3c group right ensures that the issuers

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,559
and verify us can look can look up the

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,809
necessary of public key under public law

00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,139
chain whether they belong to the same

00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:21,420
organizational identity Federation so so

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,730
essentially we are essentially more you

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,949
can hosting of it as we are trying to

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,069
move away from very centralized approach

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:32,519
to identity online which is Google which

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:34,470
is Facebook towards a more distributed

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,619
governance multiple organizations

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,040
participating in just like how before

00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:42,629
internet came about right computers only

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,939
communicate within each other in a

00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:47,069
central organization and now we are

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:50,459
trying to build connectivity among

00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:53,100
islands of local networks which become

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:55,829
the global Internet so this same thing

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,239
is going to happen to identity in one

00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,579
form or another

00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:01,199
if hyper venture Indian sovereignty does

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,509
not succeed in doing it eventually

00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:07,980
somebody will so that's my prediction

00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:11,860
so these are the challengers that we are

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:15,170
trying to solve technical implementation

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,550
we're trying to standardize that and we

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,370
are trying to avoid reliance on

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,310
centralized systems so this is being

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:25,820
soft by the beauty see so that is being

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,980
added into hyper logic indeed by the

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,410
hyper that you need to be honest the

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,449
Costas is an open open standards this

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,190
means that if you don't like what in

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,620
hyper engine it is doing you can

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,290
essentially take this open standards and

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,750
implement your own variant of - I didn't

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:45,350
need or your own blockchain system that

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,360
conforms the descendant and of course

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,430
how do we verify without relying on

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,880
central CAS right so this can be done by

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,680
having multiple parties being the

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,010
validating nodes as you will see in the

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,949
next couple slides and when added to

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,800
blockchain the blockchain serves as a

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:10,459
open public registry for all the public

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,209
keys or the deities so this is the car

00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:15,680
requirements there will be a group of

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,290
governing organizations coming together

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,300
to participate in this the performance

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,529
of this SSI system must be internet

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,049
scale

00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:29,149
to this particular point we have issues

00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:32,220
with assisting blockchain systems like

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:34,980
Bitcoin which whose maximum throughput

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,929
is about 70 PS granted that they are

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,089
building a sidechain with lightning

00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:41,549
networks a chain which is supposed to

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,679
improve in performance but fundamentally

00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:46,170
most of the blockchain system together

00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,499
up today are constrained by performance

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,019
trooper the block the block chain by

00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,819
Bitcoin is one of the example he theorem

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,519
is not much better even though they are

00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:58,079
moving towards proof of state but their

00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,559
performance is too severely constrained

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,319
and about 25 TPS even if they do move on

00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,589
to POS and increase the absolute to

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:09,779
10,000 or 1,000 or 10,000 that's you

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,809
very low if you are supposed to support

00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,309
internet scale transactions it's simply

00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:16,559
not enough so these are some other

00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,040
outstanding problem instead needs to be

00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,619
solved

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,379
I don't think hyper I did indeed truly

00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:24,449
serve this year but this is one of the

00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:28,350
core materials that would eventually

00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:32,079
need to be solved for a truly global

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,629
adoption of such a system

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,249
and of course we must be accessible

00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:38,889
meaning that not one single organization

00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:41,220
and Facebook or Google should be the

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,480
ones don't controlling your data and

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,170
finally the fourth one which is the most

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,999
important one the ledger whether it is a

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,069
centralized ledger or a decentralized

00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:53,019
area one of the core requirements is

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:55,689
that it should not be storing your

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:58,029
personally identifiable information on

00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,690
the legend self right so how do we solve

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,450
it

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,180
so the solution that hypervisor in these

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,500
are three for one

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,960
conformance with the idea that at UTC

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,510
standard two using a distributed ledger

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,970
to provide global accessibility so that

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,860
they themselves are in foundation that's

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,590
not dominating the whole composition of

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,480
the whole could throw over yon and and

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,640
at that one which is what I last

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,430
mentioned in the previous slide is the

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,800
concept of verify the claims which is a

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,140
tableau Treacy standard combined with

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,230
cryptographic technique such as zero

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,180
knowledge proof I need your PII are

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,430
personally identifiable information is

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,540
never stopped on the ledger so that's

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,430
where this is going so what is the

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,620
relationship between hyper ledger indeed

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,550
and solvent just to clarify some

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,130
terminology

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,470
Apple actually is the source code right

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,060
it's publicly available on github anyone

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,110
can run an instance of it to do

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,940
development against or you could simply

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,600
ask them to be added into the test name

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,790
of sovereign test then

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,649
the concept is pretty similar just that

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,570
there's a lot less cooling compared to

00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:10,029
the determinant ecosystem but you as a

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,800
developer can be can ask to be added

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,720
into the test net so that you can run

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,290
your test begins in past them or

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,470
something

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,120
so sovereign is nothing but an

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,560
implementation of allegedly me and

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,410
sovereign is governed by the

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,540
International nonprofit we've trustees

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,519
they're made up of different

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,649
organizations to form this thing to

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,870
govern who are going to be the real

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,940
validator notes but ultimately the

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,029
validator notes are the one in control

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,519
but by spreading control over multiple

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,829
organizations will reduce the risk of

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,199
abuse

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:47,110
so that's variable and finally a public

00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,870
network that permission by Stevens which

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,380
is one layer outside the they call

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:56,170
Governing Council so here's how it works

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,720
in a picture format yeah not my words

00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,980
ready so this is how you can visualize

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,050
it you can actually find the same

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,500
diagram on sovereign website itself

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:08,319
right on a North Side century servers

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,659
and anyone can speed up or you can

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,130
decide to participate in it and ask to

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:14,980
be added as an observer the observer

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,230
know which one they turn it on the

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,140
question on why would I want to look

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,380
right now random was it in it for me to

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,430
run its cost me to be running a server

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,100
24/7 so that's progress

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:31,010
much later but at this point in time

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:34,160
this is what the architecture looks like

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,380
and as any developers what we are really

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,570
concerned about is how do we transact

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,460
with the validator notes and observer

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,680
knows so the validator thoughts are

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,370
notes where when you need a write access

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,500
you call an API and it saves a

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,770
particular request into the legend a

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,600
transaction observer notes are when you

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,800
need to read particular information out

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,740
of it so if we take one step down we get

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,130
this high-level architecture this is how

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,950
it works

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,680
imagine you are Lucy a person your claim

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:10,220
holder of the very education

00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:16,310
certificates your birth certificate very

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:18,980
far various identifying identity and you

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:21,620
would actually get a particular claim

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,010
that you have issued by a particular

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,530
party but once this claim is issued to

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,710
you you can count assign it and this

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:34,220
gets transacted in to solve it so later

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,380
on when an employer asked to verify your

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,000
particular education qualification is

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,090
valid or not whether it's actually

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,490
issued by a valid school right oh it's

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,860
just some degree mirror that shows

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,350
itself adverse certificate for you your

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,500
employer can then easily verify against

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,290
sovereign so this is a flat system that

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,430
allows you to present the claim without

00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,980
sharing unnecessary information

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,430
so when you do this this is where the

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,720
zero knowledge proof cryptography ethics

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,090
you don't actually have to share more

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,970
information about yourself to a

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,200
potential employer then you want to you

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,740
don't actually have to share more

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,240
information about yourself through

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,730
social network if you don't want to so

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,170
that's the benefit of this system but

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,380
for it to come to friction you're

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,870
probably people now if we go one step

00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,300
lower once you understand the benefits

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,940
of this and we go one step over we can

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,910
almost visualize our D ID in this moment

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,730
this is taken directly off the w3c web

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,130
site we don't have to take any picture

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,160
of it because it is publicly available

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,470
w3c web site and this is example how D

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,700
ID looks like which is a bit similar to

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:50,460
our UUID that we're familiar and of

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,340
course if you have a verifiable claim

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,160
you claim that your birth date is this

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,040
telephone number is this right you can

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,960
is essentially declare this as an empty

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,960
keeper power and

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,340
right and get a verifiable claim back in

00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,980
this moment this is thought in your

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,409
wallet so that when you do when someone

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,019
asks you to provide a verifiable claim

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:24,179
you can then create a proof and send it

00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,190
to him you create a proof because that

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,259
proof and cribs are information and

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,299
shares only pieces of information that

00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,490
you want to share this is information

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,519
that you do not want to share will

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:39,179
remain private

00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:43,230
this is an example of how this simple

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:45,899
verifiable thing gets encrypted in JSON

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,929
web tokens on it and you can do the same

00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:51,679
by implementing anon crafts which is the

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:55,080
library written by a pelagic agree to

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,769
provide your verify the claim in a non

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,190
crap encrypted version similar to this

00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,590
moment

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:05,820
but for this moment this is stuff Jacob

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:10,200
is not an uncracked is the the library

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:14,220
implemented by hydrogenation so I type

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,129
in a bit into this concept of this

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,559
concept of zero knowledge proof right so

00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:22,110
imagine that you have two kids going to

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,809
hello in collecting sweets in their

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,610
buttons so any said what are the two

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:29,090
kids going around carrying sits in their

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:32,580
pockets and end of the Halloween party

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,289
they do not want to tell each other they

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,659
do not want to tell each other how many

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:38,789
sweets they have in about it yeah

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:41,070
but they are competitive so they want to

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,230
know the fact that they want to know is

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,090
that do I have more although I have less

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,760
compared to the other person so this is

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,620
the fact that means to be proved but

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,470
they want to prove this back when I have

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,789
more or less without revealing how many

00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:00,730
I actually have in my back so that's the

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:06,010
problem so to do so right top will

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:08,440
actually buckle four different bags

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,669
right so they don't know how many - we

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,200
don't want to reveal how many they want

00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,970
to know whether they have more than

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,580
Dallas or less than at least but they

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,409
don't want to tell LS how many yes so

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,340
you have four buckets and each buckets

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:24,549
has ten twenty thirty forty suits as an

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:28,510
example right so these are the four

00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:31,029
possibilities in our simple simple

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,639
illustration of zero knowledge proof so

00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,529
to to share this information with

00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:38,230
Eddie's but you're not revealing how

00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:42,100
many sweets here he actually has he

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:46,409
creates four blocks right each of these

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:50,289
locks will have 10 20 30 40 but and then

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:52,510
he knows that he has 26 so he would keep

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:56,139
the key for that particular lock and

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,659
throw away the recipes now it is in

00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:00,519
order to find out whether that's what

00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,799
Alice is asking for proof to me whether

00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,419
you have more or less than me and this

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,789
in order to find out whether she has

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:12,010
more or less than Bob Ellis will write

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:15,520
on four pieces of paper + - - - like she

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:17,590
deposit that into the boxes

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,340
plug it into the boxes computer

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,080
processors computer boxes so because but

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,050
only has the key

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,440
one particular box like which is the 120

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:32,790
he has an extra 20 C 36 which is why he

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,180
aspect he only kept the key to that box

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:39,910
426 so he opens it up and because le

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:44,710
Ellis has declared that she has less

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:46,480
than 20 so now now that he had opened a

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,980
box he will be able to read this piece

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,490
of paper that says - so Alice has less

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,890
than less sweets then bomb and they have

00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,140
successfully communicate that with each

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,000
other telling each other whether they

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,980
have more or less with without each

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,710
coding the number that they have in

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,930
their H of X so this is the concept of

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,450
zero knowledge and when it is

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,550
implemented as code essentially you are

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,710
able to get a piece of fact without

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:18,000
needing to know the rest of the facts

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:21,520
that that derive this fact so that's

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,520
zero and so when you combine zero

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,880
knowledge book with the concept of w3c

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,290
verifiable things you can then prove

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,490
that I actually graduated from Stanford

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,540
without revealing any other pieces of

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:39,840
Education so that is exactly how once so

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,140
the components of hyper I did indeed

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,910
this is few parts and non crap is what I

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,010
said just now it's the exact

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,690
implementation of the zero knowledge

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,430
group that is on typology evening

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,740
the rest of the system of hydrology

00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:58,850
indeed includes

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:01,640
the notes run consensus on redundant ERT

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,480
if you are familiar with different

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,940
distributed systems different

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,550
distribution that systems run different

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:16,350
kind of instances yeah that's everything

00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:18,570
from Rock VRT - what what what - larger

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,090
fabric users in the whole system which

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,000
is actually not a consensus system is

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:27,810
just a broadcasting system call call

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,330
Katka to code us own variant of the

00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:33,150
coder be empty so there are many many

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,640
distributed consensus system including

00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,650
one of the more cutting-edge ones that

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,350
is that seems to be very popular now

00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,900
which is called astha so there are many

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:45,630
ways of implementing consensus for the

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,600
case of typology indeed they have chosen

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:52,110
to implement redundant EFT which

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,610
unfortunately is probably not internet

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,200
scale

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,220
so they might have to reconsider how

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,260
they're going to implement their

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,750
processes

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,270
the state is managed in hydrologic

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:08,650
indeed using the same concept as he

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:11,910
theorems Patricia tree and storage for

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:16,240
each node is implemented using leverage

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:19,660
so that's just an overview of the

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,190
architecture to me the only flaw that

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,620
they have right now is that their

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,810
consensus mechanism is going to be the

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,540
bottleneck to support any internet scale

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:31,660
transactions it's simply not possible to

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,110
support internet scale transaction with

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,110
other via

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,100
otherwise they're essentially they down

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,860
some of the bigger problems really

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,410
related with identity which is using the

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,750
ID we are using verify the claim yeah

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,550
putting zero knowledge proof on top of

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,950
their other thing so they are sophomores

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,100
are there but when you are transacting

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:56,170
with your sovereign network eventually

00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:01,090
when there's a lot of adoption you're

00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:03,700
gonna have a problem so we can easily

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,940
jump in to github and this is the source

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,509
code

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,419
you can look through the SDK what we are

00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:13,489
interested in is written in lust and if

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,320
you compile it you get a shut up yet

00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:17,539
that share of Jack can easily be

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,059
embedded into your iOS app can be

00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:21,799
embedded into your Android app and you

00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,899
will basically be communicating with the

00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,179
sovereign test net or when you go live

00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:28,669
you can ask them to add your key into

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:31,279
the to the like that

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:33,799
and then you're in the SDK will work

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,119
perfectly so that's the SDK dan has been

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,669
familiar with they have some

00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,950
documentation though at this point in

00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:40,700
time the document the documentation is

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,700
pretty cool

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,289
I've done one upon it and basically I

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,019
had to struggle to understanding why

00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:50,229
this one so hopefully I've summarized up

00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:53,570
this for you and help you with your

00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:56,080
implementation process so this is the

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,080
summary

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,190
the most important one that we care

00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:06,679
about if we are not diving deep into a

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,679
smaller detector it's the in the SDK

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:15,070
and a communication protocol that they

00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:16,840
use this it is it is not giving them

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,470
just that the documentation is not that

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,690
building getting that getting there so

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:26,499
here's a demo code that I wrote in

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:29,080
Python and you can take a look

00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:31,480
they don't have time but essentially it

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,590
wraps around some of the function calls

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:40,480
that are built into high velocity we are

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:43,779
the SDK cause the network to us for very

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:49,919
family to ask for proof to submit your

00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:49,919
proof so this is properties

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,700
she wants to provide a better life for

00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,520
her family so she travels to the city

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,140
when she arrives she finds a recruiter

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,420
and thinks that everything will come

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,780
through easily but a bit the filled

00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,640
application nightmare is just beginning

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,670
she has to complete a lengthy form to

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,100
get a job as a caregiver in Singapore

00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:17,650
attend a training school to be certified

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:20,890
go for a medical exam and apply for her

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,610
passport big step she has to provide her

00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,430
bio-data

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,980
from the start every time when Lucy

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,690
finally reaches inable she has to repeat

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,840
the paperwork process once again to

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,880
verify her identity in fact she could be

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,160
repeating similar forms 50 times before

00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,590
she could start work these extra time

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,590
and effort is due to the outdated system

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,960
like Lucy millions of migrant workers

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,600
face these challenges their bio-data is

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,820
segmented everywhere it's time for this

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,650
process to be streamlined with Cara a

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,870
key guy an application built on

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,220
sovereign a global self sovereign

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,940
identity hyper ledger

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,350
geeky guy helps migrant workers

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,210
organizations regulators to collaborate

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,910
seamlessly on the sovereign high

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,980
collision organizations can easily

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,080
verify identities of the workers and

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,210
their claims and sovereign even with

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,060
different employment laws processes and

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,700
IT systems across different countries

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,220
here's how it works don't Iike Android

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,870
app Lucy can establish her identity and

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,560
age by first proving her birth

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,450
certificate this is done by the

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,230
Philippines

00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,330
authority could it's an icky guy agent

00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:33,900
the agents verifies embedded into Lucy's

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:36,150
claim and saves its own sovereignty the

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,450
agents been issues of verifiable claims

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:42,030
of Lucy's app where she stored securely

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:44,130
with her base identity verified she

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,560
could remotely request other agencies to

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:51,900
issue their verifiable claims like her

00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:53,820
caregiver certificate each agency will

00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,310
have a website that integrates with its

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,600
existing system to wish you and save the

00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,600
information on sovereign

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,929
she then sent a verified caregiver

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,350
certificate Eric Loya to process the

00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:15,240
employment at the Singapore Authority

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:17,340
Lucy can share her personal details to

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,100
different parties and they can instantly

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,179
verify that Lucy's claims are authentic

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,980
this way

00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,980
Singapore Authority can confidently

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:29,269
issue a work visa and it can be shown at

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:33,809
the immigration as a verifiable claim a

00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:35,610
key guy on suffering is okay so there

00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,740
was a simple prototype that I made with

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:41,970
a couple of colleagues three of us for

00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:44,129
30 days in December because of problem

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,399
with a concept like this is to get the

00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:48,779
buy-in of most of the regulator's

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,240
getting educational institutes the

00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:52,580
buy-in is relatively easy but ultimately

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,419
for it to gain wider adoption

00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,519
essentially you need to have

00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:59,369
conversations with regulators and

00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,289
government agencies so it Philippines

00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:03,389
it's out there's a separate project like

00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:05,159
why I talked about others and why we

00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:09,240
made a prototype on it is because

00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:12,119
actually they did a sovereign prototype

00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,539
with this group organizations like the

00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:17,850
Bankers Association yeah this is - I'd

00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,100
remember Tommy Hahn and they

00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,570
collaborated to the permanent SSI on

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,670
hybrid

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:27,770
so this has huge implications on AML and

00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,410
kyc processes so if you are in

00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:33,640
regulatory technologies like tech

00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:36,590
startup this this has huge implications

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,290
because it's no longer property listing

00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:42,260
estimation of who you say you are using

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,600
machine learning shifting towards more

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,660
deterministic models where it is

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,550
verifiable greatness so it has huge

00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,610
impact on opportunities for people in

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:55,160
this spaces cyber security identity

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:58,730
assessment obviously regulatory that

00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:01,550
technology impacts how notaries or

00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,740
lawyers will do their work in future and

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,560
it impacts how data integration is being

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,010
done so instead of 99 organizations are

00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,140
having to separately talk in a network

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,510
of hundred organizations 99 one

00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,900
organization has two API integration

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:20,660
with 99 other organizations multiply

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,060
that by 99 time all you need is one

00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:26,600
integration integration with one single

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:29,090
global identity management system so if

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,590
they can solve that scalable issue and

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,080
you can prove out there zero knowledge

00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,040
good I think this is essentially where

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,010
the future is

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,720
so some of the other considerations why

00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,490
are centralized applications like

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,500
Facebook and Google so successful today

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,510
well they're successful because they are

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,010
super convenient to your end user you

00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,420
don't ever think about it you dare to go

00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,130
through what we just went through for

00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,870
the past half an hour to understand

00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,930
what's happening but it has to be super

00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:59,410
simple so how how then can decentralized

00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,850
systems with we have to win by being

00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,670
super simple from an end user

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,860
perspective so as application developers

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:08,200
what we then have to figure out is how

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,450
do you design your UI how do you make it

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:14,200
super easy for other people to adopt

00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:17,890
this right now hyper ledger in these in

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,690
D dash SDK source code it's not really

00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,470
friendly it takes a lot of effort to

00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,890
know how to use it

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:26,620
so they can do better than funny but if

00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:29,110
they are able to do so and able to solve

00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,620
the performance issue with transactions

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:35,650
we are potentially looking at well the

00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:38,890
conversion of UNIX vsd nothing wrong you

00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:42,520
mean nothing obviously cool but the fact

00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:45,010
is that 99% of people using properly

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,990
configured networks they don't want to

00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,360
waste their time configuring their own

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,070
Linux system while it is fine I love it

00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,470
at the end of the day when you want to

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:57,310
get stuff done 99% of the people just

00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:00,040
once packaged solution so to me that is

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,380
the biggest barrier to how all this cool

00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,930
technology which protects our privacy

00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,380
and helps us to balance between giving

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,100
our data our way to get benefits it's

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,100
going to come true

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:24,080
I have a question about Lucy yeah so she

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,010
must with the app generate some kind of

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,200
a bikini

00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,810
I assume that's right how is that story

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,030
they store locally locally where she

00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,930
loses her phone which creates the

00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,090
possibility and opportunity of having

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:42,320
well party organizations probably seems

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:45,800
to start those that's another area I was

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,480
thinking about and yes so the our

00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,230
opportunities in the decentralized space

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:56,150
like that

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:58,630
what about like iCloud assuming we

00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,630
believe that

00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,950
which is

00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,070
and it open discussion for people who

00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:59,960
really want to see what the future for

00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:02,330
open source free software is for

00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,610
blockchain so we might everybody can

00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:07,340
stay around for this I think Martin is

00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:22,730
going to help leave this session

00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:25,780
anybody wants to participate after last

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,780
day I get rid of anything

00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,250
so everybody listening come come full

00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,020
circle

00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,240
everybody this could not have a have a

00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:47,230
shot no microphone and all presentation

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:50,290
he doesn't bite you can record the I

00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:52,650
don't might be messy I would definitely

00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:59,010
a picture is not going to make any sense

00:52:52,650 --> 00:53:01,480
yeah maybe we could do captain

00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:03,580
powerhouse cool right yeah we don't like

00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:11,500
discuss what's discussed or who

00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:13,980
discussed it is it gonna be controversy

00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,980
all right

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,420
okay just to give a rhetoric

00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,180
introduction I've been hosting these

00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:36,190
sessions in Los Angeles and that

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:38,500
Fallston in Brussels in order to to get

00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,810
a little bit more discussion about what

00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:44,589
is the relation between free software

00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:46,270
open-source and blockchain from my own

00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:50,710
perspective blockchain is kind of

00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:52,900
dominated by token trading by investors

00:53:50,710 --> 00:54:01,300
by people trying to make money people

00:53:52,900 --> 00:54:04,030
trying to start some business or

00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:11,070
something like that and it's not really

00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:13,089
focused on solving problems and helping

00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,859
the world make a better place

00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:17,440
essentially which is what free software

00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:20,560
open-source wants to do so I want to and

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,740
collect the fee software open source

00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:27,040
focused people in order to to get more

00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:29,349
focus on that we started it at first

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:34,630
time with the idea that we want to have

00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:37,240
a blockchain track at FOSDEM and I have

00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:39,640
then been working on getting a

00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:44,320
blockchain track for other conferences

00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:46,150
and as as it turns out false Asia it's

00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,859
actually the first conference it has a

00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:51,529
successful boxing track which had so

00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:53,799
function talks in a free software

00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:56,749
conference that I haven't seen before

00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:59,359
probably if we check the history was

00:54:56,749 --> 00:55:03,650
Asia maybe the first conference was the

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:08,450
large blockchain track which is great so

00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:11,089
yeah at the past the events we had like

00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:13,460
collected about 30 or 40 people who are

00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:15,170
interested in this idea and trying to

00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:20,210
build an online community where we can

00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:22,609
share and communicate and so maybe what

00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:25,249
we can do is we can do a little bit of

00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:27,619
introduction everybody give a short

00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:31,099
introduction about yourself what's your

00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:33,739
connection or interest in blockchain and

00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:36,710
then we we go from there and see what

00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:39,519
happens in the discussion do you want to

00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:43,160
start sure my name is Christopher Adams

00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:46,940
for blockchain I'm mostly working with

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:49,220
the hardware side from China this

00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,809
country keen

00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,279
which really doesn't they've they have

00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:56,940
to release a lot of things like open

00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:58,740
source free software but like my own

00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,460
work I'm more interested in some of the

00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,460
applications

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,280
things like proof of existence which is

00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:08,600
one of the first non-financial

00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,720
applications built on Bitcoin blockchain

00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:15,730
where it's embedding data like a file -

00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,730
in the blockchain and the off return

00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:22,880
what else what else to say

00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:25,790
as far as the open source stuff what I'm

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,730
mostly working in is like the Big Horn

00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:31,970
moment project which is saying you know

00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:34,700
full note wallet and everything that's

00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:36,560
built in javascript in no chance so

00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,350
there's basically two if you work with

00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,920
Bitcoin there's the original Bitcoin

00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:45,350
core C C++ application but there's

00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,580
another version you know which I think

00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:50,450
was written to kind of increase the

00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:53,780
accessibility of this but it's very hard

00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:56,960
to find developers they get hired way

00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,730
you know into companies they stop

00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,410
looking at the game of projects so

00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:02,540
there's sort of language in a little bit

00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:05,600
and I feel like there needs to be an

00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:08,180
injunction with really good young you

00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,600
know nodejs developers who can kind of

00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:12,650
pick up the mantle

00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,650
keep these projects alive

00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:21,269
have an exit us so I will become people

00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:26,799
from ourselves a baton

00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:28,660
and so you might give us something so we

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,700
do the business and this is a bit of a

00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,250
mountain side of the company

00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:36,340
recently you have been you know request

00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:39,250
materials and recently I feel for

00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:41,410
Autorama she mentioned so I think yeah

00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:44,830
for myself this wonder more about my

00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:48,710
physical acknowledge many understand

00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:50,390
more and more people but how and

00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:54,650
the practitioner what kind of

00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:56,580
expectations everything that was you

00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,990
know right

00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,760
yeah

00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:02,510
basically people more knowledge about

00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,510
the function

00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:15,080
I'm telling and I have approached it

00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:20,150
Hachiya in stock and then I now reverse

00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:24,260
some copy and they are trying to enter

00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:28,670
speaker coming to some young every stone

00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:34,540
so that now I really invited that's us

00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:37,349
I worked with between unions we have

00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,380
shown

00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,380
Oh

00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,890
so in feature I wanted to focus more

00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:51,100
yeah

00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:54,640
and because because I want to become 10

00:58:51,100 --> 00:59:00,360
minute sew-in out wage we also had a

00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,360
page teach people how to go check

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:54,570
all we had to interrupts yes okay James

00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:57,840
Michael powder bed came in here from the

00:59:54,570 --> 01:00:00,690
US actually and visiting they have made

00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:03,660
to the test center in Vietnam and we are

01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,190
in the process of kind of transitioning

01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:10,860
it into a focus on launching

01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:13,680
applications also comes on that block

01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,630
we're doing

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,089
letting that developers working on the

01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:19,890
block for accountability and also just

01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:21,240
to show people that this is the work

01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:24,390
I've done

01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,680
and so we're evaluating someone he is

01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,680
wrong in the morning

01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:38,820
from a mustiness what he has

01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,820
authenticated of common speed I

01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:47,230
investigated try studying about

01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:50,490
blockchain and happy kind of interesting

01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,490
signal for some change

01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,720
nobody can

01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:04,090
my name is spike I used to be developer

01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:05,950
business time to a hundred my interest

01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,380
started because I'm a part of SSB that's

01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:10,459
the biggest music store in the world so

01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:13,169
I meant restarting

01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:15,109
some of my startup starting with my CEO

01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:19,130
so I

01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:20,749
Rico eventually have been part of

01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,860
successful startups in the region

01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:28,110
helping them

01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:30,000
menthols recently joined as a partner in

01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:33,950
multiple will join economies in the

01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,950
gardens companies north

01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:39,479
so provide them

01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:41,819
help advise mentor in terms of the

01:01:39,479 --> 01:01:43,619
little chain I mean it's not the pink

01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:46,440
part obviously and I understand mr.

01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:48,920
smart and that he'll come installed or

01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,920
bison

01:01:51,970 --> 01:02:03,520
my name is ASA I'm here skeptical to

01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:06,130
snake oil that's really high yeah and

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,890
I'm in comedy just a student studying

01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:11,800
computer science in SUV and so this

01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:15,490
again bishop gain more knowledge on top

01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:17,530
chain and just want to is he learn from

01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:19,040
everyone else who actually in velocity

01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,880
is a hurry

01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:26,530
the Civic a possible application said

01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,530
Thomas what problems can solve using

01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:33,170
like change my brothers and sisters

01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:40,200
I'm interested in education systems

01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,680
yeah

01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:46,169
quite

01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:49,719
you know possibilities

01:02:46,169 --> 01:02:51,999
to kind of address some of the

01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:54,140
transparency issues which I feel at this

01:02:51,999 --> 01:02:56,990
point I'm late

01:02:54,140 --> 01:03:01,150
I find it I'm a fan of Julian Assange's

01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:01,150
state transparency

01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:04,960
whereas talking about

01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:13,460
there's some interaction of sort of easy

01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:22,769
demonstrating the chambers of trusts for

01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:25,099
ethically sourced products and services

01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:25,099
and so

01:03:27,859 --> 01:03:31,810
whatever's happened I'm a business

01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:36,040
architect

01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:39,980
I uh quite active in semiconductors

01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:43,490
previously corporate now

01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:47,430
in one of my project is to mental

01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:52,339
asylums and hoping that across the

01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:52,339
Catholic Venezuela in Asia

01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:59,430
hello my name is boto and you can just

01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:02,220
call me Rebecca actually I work I work

01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:04,230
for a big company as marketing but

01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,569
however actually our mastery-based

01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:11,400
experience well I worked for you last

01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:15,089
rows from 2003 to 2006 at that time we

01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,750
were looking for a preparatory desktop

01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:18,970
operating system

01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:23,170
now they are left of the company and

01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:27,400
then I worked for many years for my wife

01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:29,140
for dinner and asthma attack early this

01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,050
year I will join the illustris

01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:35,380
Foundation which is the company that

01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:40,960
and I have worked worked for and working

01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:45,340
for a while I feel anxious I can just

01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:49,120
share the vision and the latest

01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:52,090
progressive realist was Tibetan work and

01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:58,150
when actually we have already launched

01:04:52,090 --> 01:05:02,320
ICO light last year and now we have our

01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:05,200
mention published now we are working for

01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:09,400
cytokines and also the electrode

01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:20,170
framework for the foot yet you just come

01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:22,540
in time it's your turn for inspection so

01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:24,670
yeah so I have a separate valve group in

01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,230
Tallinn and been very interested in

01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,270
quick related for a long time been

01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:31,810
avoiding doing i CEOs until recently we

01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:34,540
didn't client but now calm Thailand and

01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:36,160
you raised marks we're launching on

01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:39,280
stellar

01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:43,180
I've got a stereo stellar evaluated and

01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:44,380
several others and have a very strong

01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,470
opinions about the direction that

01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:52,660
developments going on functioning

01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:58,000
so my name is Martin and as I just said

01:05:52,660 --> 01:06:01,090
we working together on alaska's and i

01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,410
have a background in the free software

01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:05,050
community I've been working with free

01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:10,750
software and with Linux for more than 20

01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:12,760
years and so free software is how to say

01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,830
it dear to my heart and that was also

01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,840
the reason why I joined the project I

01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:20,950
was specifically invited to join the

01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:24,090
project to help the project with the

01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:25,960
free software aspect of it and

01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:29,650
integrating the project into the free

01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:31,540
software community and so because this

01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:34,750
project is using blockchain I actually

01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:38,020
also had to pick up something about love

01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:39,940
chains and so I realized that there's a

01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:43,510
disconnect between the blockchain world

01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:46,950
and the free software world and trying

01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:51,650
to help with that disconnect to

01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:54,960
change things up a little bit okay I

01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:59,940
don't really have a plan where to go

01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:06,000
from here maybe we can start off with a

01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:12,300
question of what do you or what does

01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:15,210
anyone think about what a free software

01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:18,980
focused blockchain community would look

01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:22,650
like and what would that actually mean

01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:26,329
or yeah does anybody have any idea to

01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:26,329
that question

01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:34,059
area project individuals with summer

01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:35,559
project right well yeah okay but is it a

01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:37,690
free software project or is it just a

01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:43,289
project that is happening to use free

01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:43,289
software I mean that that is the thing

01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,719
[Music]

01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:53,290
what you mean is basically something

01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:55,180
whereby somehow everyone have a say in

01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:59,160
how the direction of the suppression

01:07:55,180 --> 01:08:01,120
role can hold whatever have suggestion

01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,350
like what you said there's software

01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,960
that's freedom let's say there are

01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:07,000
Maryland's uses on there is a software

01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,010
where you can basically suggest the

01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,119
change let's say a lot of people think

01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:13,200
you haven't it's

01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:17,920
change implement becomes a parking

01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:20,409
device for you man

01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,049
maybe well actually I just thought about

01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:27,339
it what what I'm thinking of this I'm a

01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:30,190
a Chris oft project is a project where

01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:36,969
the values in the project are driven by

01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:40,480
the ideals of free software and I don't

01:08:36,969 --> 01:08:43,719
see that with most abduction projects so

01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:50,170
ideals is it like GPL as in GCL as in

01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:54,460
sharing as freedom for the users and so

01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:56,199
etherium as base maybe that but most of

01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:03,159
the projects are running on top of the

01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:04,630
theorem are not right so so that's so

01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:06,940
that's so that's the question so what

01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:09,060
what is it what are the characters

01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:12,159
exhibit project or what did what are the

01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,870
characteristics of a community where the

01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:16,839
focus is free software where the focus

01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:18,219
is I think like what

01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:21,040
so what's common for the one that I've

01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:24,909
seen is that they have they they do tend

01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,639
to establish nonprofit foundations that

01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:30,170
that government

01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:32,580
right so so ether em has done that

01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:35,159
Python community is done that a lot of

01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:40,830
other projects have our client is

01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:42,449
actually establishing a a non-profit

01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:44,759
foundation that's going to all the IP

01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:46,589
for the system and will ownership number

01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:48,690
the coins and it's going to distribute

01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:52,529
coins in order to encourage people to

01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:55,320
adopt that that token and stellar

01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:57,840
project has has done this and they're

01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,969
giving away 90% of their points I think

01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,560
you see I mean you know maybe that's

01:09:59,969 --> 01:10:03,659
it's not a prerequisite but it's a

01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,949
common attribute of these kind of things

01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,210
there's not one you know governance

01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:19,920

01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:22,770
getting into more politics

01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,239
how do you run community which is a

01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:27,190

01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:31,500
