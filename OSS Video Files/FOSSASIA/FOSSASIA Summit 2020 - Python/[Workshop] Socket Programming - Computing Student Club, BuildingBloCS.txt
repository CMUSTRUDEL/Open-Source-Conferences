	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
okay good morning everyone today the

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,660
following was shot will be about in 2000

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,260
the socket programming in Python and

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:17,150
this workshop will be conducted by mr.

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,150
Jang Mis year there are JCCC students

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:27,520
several funny slips out human details I

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,740
didn't really start on the devices Yahoo

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,790
eNOS better than treatment seats but

00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,739
subsequently spinning she put herself

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,070
needs no special event of its type in my

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:41,260
career so the get into coding

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,610
colleges if there are no capital the

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:48,750
fewer parts I get out implementing

00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,309
suckers Alec of IPC for cross-platform

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,089
communication and such as the mechanism

00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:57,519
of transmission of Bella interference it

00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,909
is something most fundamental apology of

00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:05,019
commitment and pose the basis of many

00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:07,150
popular for suckers there are many

00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:22,580
educational techniques use our socket to

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:24,659
really involve a artists such as Alexa

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,600
[Music]

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,920
there are two phases circuits which can

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:37,049
be classified it comes without

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:42,100
complication properties other prevention

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:45,250
messages mister basic step effects which

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:49,630
can be found in the as far as - spoken

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:55,119
about as far today we will just be

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:58,119
focusing on since against so she's

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,920
against the develop the power using the

00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,899
same transmission control to the power

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,439
and Internet of the past it you

00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:07,799
successfully rowdy minute providing for

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,799
the evaluation

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:15,430
I think that without in her body's in

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,470
the context of she forgets each end of

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,140
the subjects associate they're running a

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,480
rhythm and the CBL in the fireplace

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,230
psychiatrist which is mosquitos the

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,360
completion of the like a peasant the

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,870
phenomena in the final program in public

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,420
about is leaving us again other ideas I

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:40,560
mean device which device at the end of

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:43,750
the sockets and food must be from 0 to

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,340
65,535 and if that's my cousin and you

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,350
thought panelists are reserved for a

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,690
specific types of programs and should

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:55,360
not be used by other purposes but I

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,510
can't miss there's actually two types of

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,500
audiences the news three actually follow

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,900
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,140
I think we follow this the depot

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:10,470
Beatrice to allow me to start to through

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:15,130
how the business by tv6 uses dominantly

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,080
rescue otherwise TV States is the most

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,810
recent version of the Internet Protocol

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,650
and he first whom already used as

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:31,510
unknown gentle ten countries will be

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:33,910
focusing on today so the Falcons we good

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,310
to know that somehow she focuses our

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:40,630
result especially use and have specific

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,209
needs such as fun 27.0 talk soon about

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,810
one and throw that to another about

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:50,280
through ascending up with of ipv4

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,280
addresses of parity

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,750
so long ago actually process of creating

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,750
a physical attraction

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,050
another popular establishment violent

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,700
excellent mention first create your

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:12,700
sober thought you were kind of UFOs

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:17,889
today the sheriff also kept on both so

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:21,810
very fine thanks we want to take our

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,810
solos okay for listening

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,370
- okay - no compost IP address

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,690
mr. doc listen command allows us so much

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,690
ammunition

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,750
thanks for the pilot program there was a

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,750
bit of violence okay

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,490
this ooh but all the planets of get to

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,490
connect the source of their business

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,490
ideas

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,710
Thanks I said the connection on this

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,710
little prayer

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:22,490
you think so sometime during tennis okay

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,490
the chairs

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:32,669
so store them in the continental US

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,669
okay integers

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:45,050
so is definition

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:49,730
thanks to try to send a message from

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:53,050
solo to the party and the dish using the

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,050
same function

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:07,449
they know that my father was very close

00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:10,659
the message to receive the message

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:10,659
because the

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,690
yes

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:25,280
I thought we need to spot a message in a

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:28,900
variable compensation to see this will

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,900
display the message using

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,130
now we run the program

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:50,360
as you can see received a message from

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:53,290
Hollywood - showing that a connection is

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,729
established between the sober time

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,729
remember to post those contacts

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,550
that

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,690

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,009
[Music]

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:44,660
oh by the way I also uploaded the code

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,760
to github I'll shine like you how could

00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,000
I keep happening y'all can see

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,160
other what's wrong with us it's them

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,820
because the audio for here's very shaky

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,080
so I want to assert any questions or I

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,920
will that we explain the Kirby because

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:07,030
yeah the audio side shaky so you have

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,030
any questions about these

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,510
it's not go to the collar game so that

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,640
so what up here I thought you have to

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,670
come socket also again and then you bite

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,440
it to our server pieces that local host

00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,870
address and port number one two three

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,980
four five you have a watchful loop so

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:30,400
you run forever then after that your

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,130
first listen for I keep socket and if

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,970
their sockets what indica if they I want

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,730
to connect to you

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,500
they go upset okay and then you will get

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,000
back a checks are careful which is

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,690
that's okay you used to communicate a

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,390
tired then you will have a quick equals

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,860
the force so while the kind of talk on

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,380
the server that's not too quick will

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,090
keep running then you just have the data

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,160
people's input and you just communicate

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,389
with the server and higher until one day

00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:03,369
decided we yeah let's key

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:03,369
you move on to that better shift it down

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:21,060
this is because this server and client

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:27,450
by antibody on item we can only connect

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:29,910
from my life from one so basically if

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,880
you want to try running this code are

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,600
two computers you can but the things

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,100
because firewall has disabled like

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,430
connecting thoroughly from part to part

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,840
so in the wall you can actually it's not

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,150
feasible to connect to another computer

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,340
using this socket this is just a

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,890
demonstration of our computer so that if

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,500
you want politicize demonstration of

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,750
what real wall sockets are basically you

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,350
have a kind so whether you connect with

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:01,230
each other on a circular yeah so

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,630
basically now there will be games or

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,640
kids on battleship hugging you socket to

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,640
say again battleship between two pair

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:16,870
you don't want to take our laptops to

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,870
follow just what

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,730
you

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,920
to shape the summer generally a cheaper

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,130
cheaper and determine random location

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,720
for the ship to be in the Caillou they

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,750
have three attempts to guess which row

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,400
and column the ship is in we have

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,980
prepared campus for the suburb and

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,670
client program you can download them at

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,800
a link shown below these are the time

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:39,000
please you can possibly you to attend

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:41,310
the challenge all right now I'll go

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,260
through the solution the three functions

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,850
here are self different purposes and can

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,880
be used multiple times in the main

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:50,850
program in degree creates the gaming

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,400
grid or display functions display the

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,560
grid to the client get user input

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,570
prompts a column for input and receives

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,140
input from Cayenne for both row and

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,140
column

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:42,550
I mean that is kind of relevant to

00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,570
soccer panda your can go and experiment

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,570
okay back to the video

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,110
engages our input there are four missing

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:54,480
lines alright so first we have to send

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:58,380
instructions to the client or user to

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,270
input their own gas then we have to

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:09,360
receive their input and study available

00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:12,500
like so then we'll repeat the process to

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,500
get column input

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,029
next we have to create a service okay

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:36,669
first we have to create a socket using

00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:38,620
the dot circuit function secondly we

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:45,249
will bind it to a local horse and a

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:47,110
polymer of our choice then we are

00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:52,090
allowed a circuit to listen for incoming

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:54,039
connections using dog listen lastly we

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,009
will use that except to allow the socket

00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:58,360
to accept any connection requests

00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,970
install the new subnet in variable

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:06,850
connector socket and adjustable in

00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:09,369
variable called address however before

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,110
we can say incoming requests they have

00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:14,379
to be a request coming from the client

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:18,190
site so now let's switch to the client

00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:21,039
program in the client program we have to

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:24,749
create the clients of them and connect

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,749
it to a service ok as such

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,770
program these two lines of code is used

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,880
to generate a random row and column

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:44,330
whether ship resists we will use a while

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,400
loop and that loop will look as long as

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,580
the number of times guessed does not

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,890
reach tree he also loop as long as

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:57,410
client has done may occur gas indicated

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:59,510
by the boolean caught one inside the

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,660
while loop this severe bestowed by user

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:05,330
input then it does a check of whether

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,970
the guesses are correct if the guesses

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:11,600
are aware the 1 billion becomes true and

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:14,090
the wallet stops it is good to take note

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,049
every increment times guess I want every

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:20,900
time the client makes a guess after

00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:24,880
every gas will be updating and

00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,880
displaying the pre using this code

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,640
lastly we have to let the user know if

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,740
he wins all those to do this we use the

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,570
send off function under the condition

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,570
which claimed one occur and loss

00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:01,000
[Music]

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:04,539
now let me explain the current program

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,640
code using an infernal not true the

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:09,580
clients appear who continuously receive

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,720
data from the circle a resistor code

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,909
using the dot receive command as such

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,080
whilst it is received the president

00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:22,450
decoder data if enter is detected in the

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,210
data receive this mr. is fronting the

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:30,039
client for input task we have to send

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:32,200
him user input back to the circle if you

00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,059
want or you loss is the data

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,530
he missed the game is over and the water

00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:43,720
loop will break it's a good practice to

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:45,460
close the supplies we use this concludes

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,210
the owner workshop we hope you have

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,840
learned something

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,840
thank you

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,790
you

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:08,330
okay so since next few time let me go to

00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:12,740
again the PYD I wrote for this oh yeah

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:16,530
yeah so basically this came up here I

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:21,210
let me open the IDE look something like

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:26,130
this basically when you run it is the

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:28,590
RPG game so this is the map that sees

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:31,650
your character dots are nothing spaces

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:34,799
is the enemy and P is the treasure which

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:37,020
you have to go to so you can improve up

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,570
down left or right to go and if you

00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,710
input the wrong thing you will say false

00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:48,179
move I ask you to try again let me just

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:51,940
put down let me just move down

00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,250
yeah okay so what happened to amira and

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,970
emir so i'm just gonna be an enemy right

00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:00,370
here yo peanut this I have to talk shirt

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,269
if you don't attack or you run away from

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,669
this enemy

00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:05,799
so that's right hackers what to press

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:08,380
attacked will print out these deaths and

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:11,200
then so basically from here you can see

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,419
that the enemy has ripped in half you

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,149
have 20 hell you are technique for seven

00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:20,010
damage yes it helps that and making you

00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:23,019
45.5 damage so you have 14.5 after so

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,809
since it has that it helped that not

00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:30,820
just higher gear and now here's what

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:32,710
happened of that I have remaining let's

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,580
just say one more time

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:38,500
and yes we defeated enemy so as we

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,980
defeated and a minimal get up data and

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:45,789
there'll be less enemies so what happens

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:50,169
is every seven tons the women will be

00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:51,789
even more enemies updater right I'm just

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,249
going to go

00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:57,399
yeah okay so what happens if you try to

00:31:54,249 --> 00:32:00,759
run away from the enemy there's a 50%

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,369
chance we'll get it up hey I ran away

00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:05,619
that's good

00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:09,070
so let me just keep moving to the

00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:15,519
schedule oh no there are even more

00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:17,649
enemies scary so as you can see the game

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,450
is not very important yet because you

00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:22,450
can just run past all the enemies and

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:26,200
you can just reach the treasure data I

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,269
mean right but okay so you might be

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:34,739
wondering how does this relate to socket

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:37,869
programming yes this fan answer so

00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:40,450
basically right what happens is you know

00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:42,099
these kinds of game the majority of your

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,259
game code if they choose not stop on

00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:48,099
your client service on your client side

00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:50,409
because that might be too heavy on your

00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:53,950
computer and you want to have you want

00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:56,109
the people to have yeah you you doing so

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,809
much code on your current computer so

00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:02,229
basically most of this code can be

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:03,700
placed on a server and then the client

00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:06,070
just need to interact the server the

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,919
server this is called the energy the

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,909
solar Dube energy and return something

00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,970
to the crier

00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:15,729
so what if that's say you don't want to

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,840
have so much cool on the client side so

00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:22,239
let me show you what it might look like

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:26,649
this will be what potentially looks like

00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:29,130
for a client code for this cow came in

00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:32,419
this was to walk or increment

00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:36,690
in conjunction with us our code by Luca

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:40,440
from 200 not lines yes cut out 259 lines

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:42,299
of code and the majority of the coins

00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,740
taken by this enemy scribe which is

00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,399
really cool

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:49,559
I like you yeah and you can figure yeah

00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,720
and she cut out or not and this is

00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,700
awesome

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,789
some games they basically let you

00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,669
download your client base to download

00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:01,350
they dunno some client code but it's not

00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:03,059
very much even though the game is very

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,379
expensive and has lots of functions

00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:08,280
that's because most of the back end

00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:10,800
logic is a cheap place inside the server

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,800
game table here I so then we just go to

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,250
a server game of hawaii's Evo you see so

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,079
much again is even more code if there

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,129
are two hundred lines of code they I

00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,060
wrote myself

00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:26,159
yeah so what

00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,500
so basically why did I changed from the

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,929
original code so first I copy which the

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,609
other code here by other imports okay so

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:43,589
basically for other code there need

00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:46,530
input let's see here basically under

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:48,599
code and either import let's say you had

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:55,770
the input at that level right inside a

00:34:48,599 --> 00:35:00,410
move function he write this is all this

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:03,250
is all changed because I add

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,250
amazing

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:10,790
I mean anytime fine okay so yeah you can

00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,960
see ya

00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:17,270
instead of just asking for input Kalinda

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,030
hi thankful function when you have to go

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,700
there are none left right instead I send

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:27,710
this over to the client where you miss

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:31,010
Phoebe yeah so basically I ended a

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:35,780
special dinner input as a father only

00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:39,560
and a fountain string and then every

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:43,100
time that is input inside the string

00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,910
then he will ask the client to input the

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:51,560
data so he can send send it over to the

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:54,920
server basically the server unique and

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,920
for the standard swap meets out you just

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:02,030
send it over to the client medic I have

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,020
a printout on everything so let's try

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,020
running this game first

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,790
when the client connects to the server

00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:14,310
the server generate a map and then that

00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,730
I hope reads here and you can see that

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,430
us

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,640
there's reinforcement things we'll look

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:23,690
at this later so basically we want to go

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,940
right to ghostwrite

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:29,130
right we keep these functions just as a

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,290
normal game except that the client code

00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,210
is so much more smaller so you can

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,010
actually come now you don't have to

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,140
write so much current client won't have

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:41,370
to spend so much time downloading it so

00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,360
do you as you can see by right I'm

00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,900
always right

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:49,790
not a ticket yeah see it is always the

00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,790
same then you can attack

00:36:50,120 --> 00:37:02,600
but hack my diet oh no I have 8.5 health

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:06,280
remaining enemy has 7 health ok so yeah

00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:12,170
this here is a problem of you know 18/10

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:15,620
it's ok I'll do that later ok although I

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:20,270
thought I am for help left but enemy

00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,870
yourself so you'll though yes I defeat

00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,280
the enemy

00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,050
oh yeah and I'll show you what happens

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,750
if you actually get defeated by the

00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:33,140
enemy that's the only way you can fail

00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:36,790
this game ok so basically here I

00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:40,370
[Music]

00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,820
basically K I thought that if you have a

00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:45,800
game going at the sovereign Clanker

00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,060
but you we were falling for the server

00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:53,030
side to just watch the time they gave so

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:56,440
whether it's reinforcement so basically

00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:59,180
every seven maybe seven thoughts the

00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,910
server can choose whether they want to

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:06,380
send me phosphorus basically my enemies

00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:10,250
or they can talk to them this will

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,200
essentially like a almo strategy for the

00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,510
server side even though it's a piece to

00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,050
an animal strategy that for example if

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,640
you see that the character is like oh

00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:23,460
you have to save your reinforcements

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,250
perhaps they can type N and then you

00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,079
you can don't sign your reinforcements

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,300
and the guy talking to choose where to

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,540
go if you decide to say in

00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:37,470
reinforcements then the character which

00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:41,790
suddenly swap with enemies and yeah you

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,050
might be an unexpected whatever so since

00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:47,250
my characters are what help they just

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:51,960
die anyways wait no I one shot at the

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:54,270
enemy cool okay so so basically every

00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,880
time you get to send reinforcements me

00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:00,569
maybe this time alright and the cutest

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,109
character ID so boring then I said yeah

00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:04,020
why

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:06,359
dammit early the man gets updated and a

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:13,160
sunny Sauvage no enemies for me to

00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:13,160
society so I will just die again

00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:19,939
oh they're my the enemy he people fill

00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:22,129
by five damage the enemy so big yeah by

00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:26,989
the way the enemy generations are random

00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:28,009
and oh my character so Opie if it

00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:32,209
another enemy

00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:40,320
I feel like a gesture came in stream

00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:44,250
right now let's just die

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,460
I walk by find out that oh then I look

00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:50,540
here and I mean he Godzilla damage why

00:39:47,460 --> 00:40:00,770
my so lucky at the wrong time okay

00:39:50,540 --> 00:40:03,960
hey I defeated enemy try again okay so

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:08,300
you can thank me for the game I'll do so

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,300
so I can kill myself

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,539
yeah so basically this game like Scylla

00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:20,940
factions like items like XP stuff you'll

00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,039
find harmony RPG but it's just a proof

00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,539
of concept that a lot charm coke

00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:30,630
actually be lesser so you can actually

00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:33,630
have the client oh I finally that the

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,400
game over so basically the client code

00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:39,140
that's not have to download as much con

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:43,650
the outside to be able to play the game

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:45,650
for so

00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:48,180
with the key let's look at a co again

00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:52,229
the only reason why surprise here is

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:55,140
cause you cannot send this over so again

00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:58,499
because the socket does not allow you to

00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,660
anchor this so there are some stuff that

00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:02,969
you cannot several circuits or there'll

00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,239
be some stuff where if you put in the

00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:07,950
socket if you could on the back end then

00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,650
we could slow like some games the

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:14,069
reaction time so a lot a stuff be

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:16,319
started on fire site but generally the

00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:19,969
logic behind the game cannot be

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:24,499
condensed and so yes again basically

00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:27,239
made the cost rata the current dollar

00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:31,430
since we have more time let me just go

00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:35,539
to who I be doing for this game so I

00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:37,619
never met met class here so very

00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:40,849
initialized where you shouldn't

00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:45,900
initialize the vectors where we try to

00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:48,690
here MP equal to M met so we initialize

00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,960
will call random integer anywhere from 1

00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:55,079
to 18 that's because the fourth and the

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:59,869
last ones of the list will always have

00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,869
to be the boss as you can see here

00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,880
as you can see

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,520
here the first and last line through

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,920
always these walls and you can't read

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:15,890
you can't go into it so for this I use a

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,530
generation random generation and many

00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:24,320
such them a user to the array basically

00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:26,990
so and I use nested follow so far twenty

00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,080
times I will create each line of this

00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:33,770
and I make sure that only on the

00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,960
thirteenth line and then J goes to any

00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,770
random number then there will be a

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,290
treasure

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:44,360
so Java always be on the thirteenth life

00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:48,140
but number we went up then else right I

00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:50,450
would just have a random from one to ten

00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,580
like basically does have a third

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:57,290
possibility the enemy or beyond that

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,180
space and then else if the if I believe

00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,970
is not a treasures but or if it's not

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,400
enemy stock you'll just have had a talk

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:07,580
then this arrived for eighteen times and

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,850
they were funny append back of the war

00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,190
and then resolve the subcommittee of

00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:17,480
handy's list so when she gives out dot

00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:21,680
map is a list of twenty weeks which is a

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:25,270
2d matrix of this entire map I hope that

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,520
our be that SVT Cobra Peter Kostis is

00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:30,800
deviating from soccer and going into

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,430
object of programming but sometimes this

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,980
Python despite don't obsess mesh

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,950
together to create something up so

00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,550
you'll have to

00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:44,320
Dennis so I just have there have some

00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,609
basic functions like get mapped and

00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,650
changed man

00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:51,160
like if I want to change this particular

00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:54,670
location from animal I say the enemy's

00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:59,109
defeat that so now you become doctor and

00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:02,730
then just show function I basically use

00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:07,060
some if looks in one statement because

00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:14,430
to make in it oh right of course

00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:14,430
this is same as media's writing

00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:22,130
yeah this is same as me deciding if ha

00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:22,130
face bigger than zero

00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:44,920
so basically this is the same as this

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:47,259
code except they are writing only one

00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,569
line because for larger projects like

00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:55,390
this I wanted people to understand the

00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:57,819
code but not like heavy too long so this

00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,559
is equal to this and I returned realize

00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:01,119
that there's a contradiction because I

00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,279
should also add comments and

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,150
documentation which I didn't have time

00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:10,559
to end but if I did then you will be

00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:13,599
yeah it will be easier to understand

00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,119
yeah I think documentation is really

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,099
important because if not you won't have

00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,229
people will understand what you are

00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:23,650
writing and you have to explain to them

00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:27,210
which wastes a lot of time so for this

00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:30,789
show function I basically just have

00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:33,369
nested for loop and then if and then I

00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:35,769
checked by with the soft on map function

00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:37,979
and after they are just printed like

00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:37,979
this

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,789
and then so map is the same thing

00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,490
but so men the same team is a smaller

00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:51,730
man because if you input a whole map

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:54,369
every time it is unnecessary and he

00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:58,960
takes a longer time so I just happy

00:45:54,369 --> 00:46:02,890
around the character 5 space facts bases

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,710
around character will show the man then

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:09,430
Lister enemy encounter and basically if

00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:11,799
the enemy encounter will be done to also

00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:16,059
returns boss same thing for treasure

00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:18,480
hunter and then this the enemy so basic

00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:22,079
here and and the me generation cocaine

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,450
to add reinforcements yeah

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,869
so ridiculous enemy one where you

00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,000
initial X there we random variable

00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:37,329
difficulty and the difficulty will set

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:41,609
the health and the attack which can so

00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:44,440
what happen is if there's every time

00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:51,970
look at

00:46:44,440 --> 00:47:00,250
it's called anytime there is enemy right

00:46:51,970 --> 00:47:03,120
then your car not enemy no it's in a

00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,120
move on sir yes

00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:13,040
so if M Peter enemy encounter he goes to

00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,760
show you quit fighting enemy they're

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,060
clear random integer of what too far

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:23,470
they are print other and Miss Christ you

00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:26,540
feel the attack and other hand stops

00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:33,280
they have the death you will call the

00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:33,280
enemy to attack so oh my god

00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:46,690
so basically these clothes are just like

00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,870
so I'm driving

00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:02,180
the most important function here is the

00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,830
move function because that's where

00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,100
everything happens other checks happen

00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:09,100
so we are wondering how they cope games

00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,830
here you go this is how you contains

00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:15,590
basically every movement you make

00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:17,060
firstly this is just to make sure that

00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:20,870
young people think have done laughs all

00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:25,190
right else you just put no thank you

00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:28,610
we want right input so for here every

00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:32,420
time you a game branch are you will

00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:34,790
check if you first get a charger if not

00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,970
you will check if you first have enemies

00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:43,100
if really you don't have then you just

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:45,110
move you so basically games are like

00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,450
that too in your life they were every

00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:50,390
time you do something the guitar check

00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,760
to make sure any environment are

00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:58,220
variables having moved if they have then

00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:02,390
they were actually showing a game so for

00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:04,580
the treasure encounter is just twenty

00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:08,210
found the treasure will be and then

00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:11,680
return false this is the signal the code

00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:11,680
to some store and in a book

00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,050
I

00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:20,560
like

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,560
okay

00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,730
if you feel good in your microwave - no

00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,730
I

00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,380
let's move on up

00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,349
thank you so yes I'll walk

00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:57,810
test test wine okay

00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:28,729
- hi

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:28,729
so I used my phone now okay where was I

00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:43,440
so so how okay so four enemy generation

00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:46,319
when there's enemy encounter which means

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,359
the MV dot enemy encounter returns true

00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,999
then your premium fighting enemy and

00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:52,799
then you're sent over fight the enemy

00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:55,529
who does okay this is just a way of

00:51:52,799 --> 00:52:00,150
printing things then you will generate a

00:51:55,529 --> 00:52:04,559
random enemy so while this is well true

00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:07,739
is and that means like wow the enemy is

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:11,009
still alive then you will print the

00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:14,099
sprite and you'll send us back over the

00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:18,710
entire Europe print the options you have

00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:25,489
and then you can input either one or two

00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:28,589
then you received a message from the

00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:31,410
Cuyuna and then basically if it's not

00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:36,029
one not two you ask you to go again if

00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:38,519
it is if you this is a route so you'll

00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:47,700
keep running this until the clients

00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:51,150
enter one or two so if it is if it does

00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,880
sell - then you print out the status you

00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:58,410
print out your health and the other that

00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:00,719
if it's one then you will attack and you

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:03,299
see here my attack generation is

00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:07,200
basically using a base attack then

00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:10,589
there's a plus - from negative 3 to 3

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:13,229
so basically your range will be anywhere

00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:15,830
from negative 3 to 3 then your hidden

00:53:13,229 --> 00:53:18,350
enemy for this amount damage

00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:23,140
they'll print how much you attack for

00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:26,090
then after that your enemy if enemies

00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:28,730
the health is greater than zero then

00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,320
it's smaller than zero they open enemy

00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,410
defeated and you will start running the

00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:36,770
court because I did all the enemy Canada

00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:40,370
you so if you run the same thing if a

00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:42,470
equals to two if then you have 50%

00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:45,680
chance of running away this is just my

00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:48,530
random generation call I have one here

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,050
and then I call random to run in one or

00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:54,050
two so there's a 50% chance you'll be

00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,870
one 50% chance they'll be two so if it's

00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,550
the 50% chance that one day open runway

00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:01,670
successfully and you'll start running

00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:06,050
else right you will print so to run away

00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:09,290
so why why did I at the enemy to attack

00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:11,330
coat yet because the thing is if you

00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:13,310
fail to run away the enemy ogre freaky

00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:15,650
on you and then if you didn't defeat the

00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:17,900
enemy the enemy also get here on you so

00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:20,510
since those two outcomes are the same

00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,340
you don't need to write the enemy attack

00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:26,120
code twice you just need to write it

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,220
after the if loop which is your so

00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,980
because they both sent share the same

00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:34,340
outcome so if they don't break then they

00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,620
will have to get damaged by the enemy so

00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,470
for the damage I call an immediate

00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:42,350
damage function if you go up here the

00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:49,720
damage function is just the same thing

00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:52,700
support AB and then plus -3 then your

00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:56,300
damage yourself sub health - because

00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:59,630
damage it is smaller than 0 small of

00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:03,710
equal to 0 your print you have been cute

00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:05,930
and then this time does sleep here is to

00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:09,380
ensure that people have time to actually

00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:11,630
read why you stand before the repeating

00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:14,390
around and because when you repeat the

00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:17,270
model you will print the sprite as you

00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:19,940
see here this not our sprite so take out

00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:25,610
the whole screen so you can like read

00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:27,170
these are Co again so I hope in latest

00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,220
me for like two seconds so we can

00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:32,440
actually the

00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:35,359
before moves on and then yeah once

00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,359
basically once it has been difficult

00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:42,980
this loop will break and then so your

00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:45,290
change change map from this is the

00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,480
position of your character

00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:52,010
so basically evil characters on this

00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:54,050
position and enemy and I mean identify

00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:57,470
the enemy I run away from the enemy then

00:55:54,050 --> 00:56:00,349
the enemy will be changed from an e to a

00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:03,200
dot so the enemy won't appear game then

00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:14,240
you can continue on a merry way to call

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:17,089
the move function again so yeah then

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,280
these codes are pretty typical of socket

00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:21,890
programming muqaddas socket the socket

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:27,170
you buy knit and then you listen for ID

00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:32,869
connections and so like this adjusts you

00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:34,849
print out like the menu like yeah then

00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:40,339
today you have a road to loop that keeps

00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:47,329
running until the person dies basically

00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:48,330
this is the reinforcement code and then

00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:54,900
this is

00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:57,210
just cook this is basically like you can

00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:00,050
choose whether to assign reinforcements

00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:03,750
or don't send reinforcements and then

00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:06,900
for here it's just the same movement

00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:08,970
code they ask you to send him up down

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,900
left right then the day you will call

00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:17,010
into the function that move and then if

00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:21,360
if not if if we turn if this boolean

00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:24,960
function returns false it means that the

00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:27,360
character has died from our earlier part

00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,820
of the code so you print out game over

00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:34,590
and then you'll break the function else

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:37,770
you will keep running this code for

00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:40,890
those that just join in we are looking

00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:42,810
at this game code using socket

00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:45,420
programming so basically I'm

00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:48,120
demonstrating that even such a huge

00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:52,380
chunk of back-end code can be simplified

00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:57,360
using socket if we know this is the

00:57:52,380 --> 00:58:01,980
shell then just close the shell so

00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:06,200
basically the original code looks

00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:09,780
something like this

00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:11,580
so this is the game code and it looks

00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:14,610
very long it looks right hideous and

00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:16,770
then if you are bringing up on industry

00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:18,450
level standards it will be even longer

00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:21,300
and it will be probably a few gigabytes

00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:25,560
if not a terabyte of code to work with

00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:28,320
so but if you are if you want a game to

00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:31,980
work you want your client to download

00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:34,200
the least amount of bytes possible for

00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,020
your code to run so basically utilizing

00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,440
socket I cut down on the number of coda

00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:42,810
client hairs from around 300 lines to

00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,940
just 50 lines so they only need to

00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:47,610
download 50 lines of code but of course

00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:50,220
you have to connect to the server where

00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:51,960
the server will have about 300 lines of

00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:55,620
code bye doesn't matter because the

00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,520
server is on your side and so the you by

00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:01,080
doing this you cut down on the basic

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:06,930
requirements that apply on it

00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:09,240
you have to run a game yeah so for the

00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:11,850
game Sylar is not that there won't be

00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,040
any code there'll be some code that can

00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:16,110
be sent over to soccer like for example

00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,510
you might an example this player and I'm

00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:20,580
in sprite it can be said over truce okay

00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:24,390
because it can be encoded and then there

00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:27,780
also some stuff that let's say that your

00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:30,150
game is a swab reflexes so if you send

00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,790
it from server to client and your

00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:35,790
internet speeds especially slow in might

00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:37,860
not be so good for like those kind of

00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,780
games so there are some games that still

00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:42,060
has to be written in a front-end but

00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,460
mostly games operate by putting mode

00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:49,230
majority of your corner back and so that

00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:51,510
client doesn't need to do so much TP so

00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:54,030
basically for that anchor it looks

00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:58,770
similar to all the code you just

00:59:54,030 --> 01:00:01,500
received the data but I have this this

00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:03,420
part here so basically if the server

01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:06,750
wants you to input something you put in

01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:12,120
put inside the data they receive so if

01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:14,600
the input well input not in data so that

01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:18,690
means it will keep receiving data until

01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,610
improve nor in data so if the data sent

01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:22,350
by the server is sprite that means the

01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,990
server wants us to print the sprite so a

01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:27,540
printer sprite if the data equals to

01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,880
game over then we will know that the

01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,240
game is over they will close the client

01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,150
socket

01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,820
if not we'll print the data so basically

01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:37,950
this will print data continuously until

01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,890
we receive something from the server

01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:43,830
that has input in it once we do we'll

01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:46,890
quit after we'll clean out this loop

01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:49,470
since input is not in data so we'll

01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:53,310
start running the loop then we will ask

01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:56,910
the client to input the data and the

01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:59,400
enter that you can send our data back

01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:02,330
over to the server then you will repeat

01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:07,620
this loop again so basically your keep

01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:09,810
receiving inputs from the server so for

01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:11,760
those that come in y'all haven't seen

01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,940
how the game runs so let me just show

01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,760
you

01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:18,960
you run the server code first

01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:22,380
they run the client code the server will

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:26,010
generate a map a random map and then you

01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:30,200
were sent to the client then this client

01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:33,119
can input for reference this is the map

01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,850
these are the walls these are the dots

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,760
are nothing is the enemy and sees your

01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:42,630
character and you want to go to T a

01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:46,560
randomly generated treasure point so

01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:49,950
like you can win the game so you can

01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:52,650
input left you can go left but you can't

01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:55,800
because left beside is like a gay it's

01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:58,470
like the wall so you can put right and

01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:02,060
then you update the map and you'll see

01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:05,250
you move right you can move right again

01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:08,480
by her the spell right currently it's

01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:13,800
harder to type with one hand I realized

01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:24,300
then you can go down and down and this

01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:26,310
is the enemy attack sequence okay no I'm

01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:34,560
not making common sense but I will make

01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:48,650
the font bigger a little oh oh no my mic

01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:48,650
in me to be okay

01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:57,050
so yeah basically you have two options

01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:59,840
when you come into a character you can

01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:01,610
in the attack I'll run and these are

01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,160
code that I just explained just now so I

01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:07,250
won't go to the bar basically we can

01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:11,690
attack and see you will do a random

01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:16,460
damage based on random generator dammit

01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:19,480
that's not so random because 51 yeah we

01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:23,840
still want to have like a base attack

01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:26,030
okay so basically every time enemy gets

01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:36,560
defeated the enemy on the map will

01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:39,560
disappear okay so as I was writing this

01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,810
code I thought oh maybe the people on

01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,000
the server side is not having fun right

01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,650
this is why you want this to be a

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,100
two-player game like a battleship game

01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:51,650
so like what why if these sites were

01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:55,520
boring so I added these reinforcements

01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:58,850
so as you go about defeating enemies on

01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,380
your server side there will be lesser

01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:02,180
and lesser enemies look at this map

01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:05,300
there's something white enemy via beside

01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,160
me I can just easily avoid it so like

01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,410
where's the challenge in this game now

01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:14,750
so like for here right

01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:16,610
then you will so every time you know

01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,950
bill condon timer on the server side

01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:21,920
that the client does not know off then

01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:25,820
every time we just zero you can choose

01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:29,600
to send reinforcements so let me

01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:31,850
demonstrate by typing yes then suddenly

01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:35,510
for your map just added so much more

01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:38,630
enemies okay so this has a strategy

01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:41,210
element to the game on the server side

01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:43,040
also because the server's I can choose

01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,990
whether they want to send it or maybe

01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,090
they can hold it off so they can send

01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,740
like two or three reinforcements at the

01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:53,240
same time and just overwhelm the

01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:56,990
character this can yeah this is like

01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:58,760
animal strategy and like - and the

01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:01,990
server won't be actually be part because

01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:04,030
without this the server you just lose

01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:06,750
watching the client play and not playing

01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:09,369
themselves obviously in

01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,990
industry-standard the server doesn't

01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:14,410
have to do anything and so after the

01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:17,020
client but since this is just on my

01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:21,490
local address I wanted to have some fun

01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:23,770
so I just added this honestly this code

01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:27,780
is still lacking a lot of things and it

01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:30,580
can be barely be considered a game but

01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:32,619
this is just a proof of concept that you

01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:36,670
can entry diminish other code from

01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:39,369
server like if you haven't liked so much

01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,050
base code for the game you can just not

01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:50,940
you don't have to let a client download

01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:54,760
everything so now I'll just win the game

01:05:50,940 --> 01:06:04,680
because I explain around everything that

01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:04,680
is then hang on I need to type

01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,519
[Music]

01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:50,420
okay so I kill I've been killed by the

01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:53,750
enemy so now I end up the game and yes I

01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:59,230
I think that's it for my game showcase

01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:59,230
there is nothing else any questions yeah

01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:09,920
yeah

01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:12,320
nervously yeah basically yeah this is

01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,070
direct connection to the computer which

01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,900
is why the firewall actually blocks any

01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:20,420
like outside connections on the parts

01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,140
but this is a simulation of Internet

01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,140
sockets yeah

01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:29,230
are there any more questions well this

01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:32,210
code can be found my github page

01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:34,060
let me shamelessly part my wiki homepage

01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:36,500
here

01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:39,460
so basically you can go to this website

01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:43,280
you can find other socket programming

01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:44,720
virtual materials including all the code

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,230
that we have just mentioned so maybe

01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,540
that if you're interested in learning

01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:53,600
socket programming can copy/paste some

01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:59,300
code here as like your base to stay off

01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:05,440
twin socket for Graeme yeah hmm are

01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:05,440
there any other questions if not I think

01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:24,790
yes basically every computer if you want

01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,850
to connect the internet it has sockets

01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:28,270
let me show you let me go to my command

01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:32,770
prompt

01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:38,670
I can go to next step we know what was

01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:41,739
the exact command so basically if you go

01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:43,719
yeah you show other parts and then

01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:46,600
you'll see you can see it's connected to

01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:48,670
that YouTube like under fire for stuff

01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,949
basically if you want to connect to the

01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:58,690
internet you have to connect it using

01:08:50,949 --> 01:09:02,370
parts let me just - in okay so basically

01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:06,310
these are other parts here you can see

01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:10,109
127.0.0.1 this localhost these are all

01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:10,109
the localhost parts that I have running

01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:15,940
and then these are other external parts

01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:22,529
which means like all the website then

01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:22,529
connected to and then so you see this is

01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:30,520
yeah basically yeah if you want to

01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:38,620
connect and transmit data you have to do

01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:41,020
it using sockets yeah and then you can

01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:44,350
see here are how are the port numbers

01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:46,509
which are nothing behind the address

01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:49,810
these port numbers they are all unique

01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:51,159
that's because no two sockets can

01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:55,290
connect to the simple at the same time

01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:58,780
so yeah your computer has a lot of parts

01:09:55,290 --> 01:10:04,270
65,000 to be sure so that you can can I

01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:05,800
do a lot a lot of things yeah so if

01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:12,310
there are no further questions I think

01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:15,370
we can end this talk okay thank you very

01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:15,940
much for your kind attention and see you

01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,950
soon

01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:20,340
frost yeah

01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,340
