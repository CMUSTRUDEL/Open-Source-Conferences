Description: 
	I'm a beginner enthusiast in the world of software development and have been starting to learn about coding through the programming language of Python. Despite having little to no experience in programming, I've decided the best way to learn would be to just embark fully on a python-based project, as part of learning it. And so, the very first project I've decided to work on would be to create a simple algorithm on scraping the web for details of Jeju Korea. As, I am planning a trip there in early April, killing two birds with one stone essentially. With that, I decided again, to further challenge myself through giving a short lightning talk about it at one of Asia's most popular software and tech-event, on my experience on the project. But more importantly, I personally find it a pretty good way too, to share the experience with many other like-minded individuals, on the learning of programming from scratch with all the readily available open-source modules/libraries these days.
