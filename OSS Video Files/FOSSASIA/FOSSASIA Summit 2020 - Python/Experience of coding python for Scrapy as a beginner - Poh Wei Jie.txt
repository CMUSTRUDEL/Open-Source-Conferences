Title: Experience of coding python for Scrapy as a beginner - Poh Wei Jie
Publication date: 2020-03-27
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Python
Description: 
	I'm a beginner enthusiast in the world of software development and have been starting to learn about coding through the programming language of Python. Despite having little to no experience in programming, I've decided the best way to learn would be to just embark fully on a python-based project, as part of learning it. And so, the very first project I've decided to work on would be to create a simple algorithm on scraping the web for details of Jeju Korea. As, I am planning a trip there in early April, killing two birds with one stone essentially. With that, I decided again, to further challenge myself through giving a short lightning talk about it at one of Asia's most popular software and tech-event, on my experience on the project. But more importantly, I personally find it a pretty good way too, to share the experience with many other like-minded individuals, on the learning of programming from scratch with all the readily available open-source modules/libraries these days.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
as you can see through my title today

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:07,799
I'll just be sharing my experience of

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,330
recording for Python as a beginner so as

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,370
mentioned my name is Peter because he

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,320
totally doesn't include virtually yeah

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,119
so let's started so first things first

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,520
maybe other been back story on why

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,520
decided to start programming at all and

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,350
yeah so anyway you can start it off

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,050
first thing first a little bit of a

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,300
backstory to why I started to start

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,370
going to programming mmm so just like a

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,350
couple months ago my mom came to me is

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,530
just a debt you know we go to a career

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,239
generally for a holiday and so she asked

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,410
me to come with my two other places to

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,360
go mr. Knight

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,600
so with that kids with that thought in

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,640
mind or opportunity came to I know what

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,930
I could do to come up with recent places

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,060
so the first option I could maybe he

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,970
told us all right get a bunch of people

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,939
to know I really yeah or maybe a little

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,860
more modernized I could Google just

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,650
below us manager always we're going

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,680
right great way to be efficient or a

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,750
better still you know then in contact

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,030
with a bunch of Korean friends and ask

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,280
them what really where it is and what's

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,680
a girl and stuff so I realized I was

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,610
probably I can actually have Korean

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,110
friends you know one more option keeper

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,970
might have I I spent three months

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,579
painstakingly compile-time determinable

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:52,380
scratch afterwards they were setting it

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:56,310
up and it don't mean totally right yeah

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,780
and so a little bit more particular web

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,320
scheduler model that I used to create

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,750
this and all this asleep so if you're

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,159
married or living screaming yeah so as

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,770
you notice the web scripting want to do

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,750
that basically the title uses a slightly

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,550
a lot so

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,950
what's great is it's a Python may start

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,200
screaming or you miss mention and you

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,400
know we can call them that also some

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,650
information will be something out there

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,760
they're using like different spiders and

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,770
all so yeah and a person I'd like to

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,020
actually use this great image a CSS

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,060
selector around middle kind of crazy

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,709
algorithm and select together it I want

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,300
so we're dead Chris my planning so I was

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,950
planning to he'll create an algorithm is

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,450
mentioned and then you know where

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,630
reference made to be dispersed across

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,590
pilots PC implant where in Italy there

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,380
screaming fittings of the places there's

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,320
a composite into an excel file and then

00:02:49,380 --> 00:03:00,420
afterwards become we add add too much

00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:04,800
maybe eventually true reader anyway so

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,930
first things first right so let haven't

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,950
you know anything about programming and

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,660
Molly I started to the title so base I

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,269
found like a really good website ramiz

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,970
learn Python is this please don't work

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,760
anymore so I secure really interactive

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,900
sort of way to not you don't want to

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,610
intense as you can see the same time

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,350
then again you know don't under any

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,519
sponsorship with your library

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,549
I know once in your city give me a

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,480
sponsorship sure we have happy ones yeah

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,590
and so cure was my first ever message

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,299
that I got training himself might only

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:47,190
true story and so to get it all up and

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,769
running down first thing I had to you

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,370
know install Python all right the newest

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,260
version 0.8.1 and of course now this is

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,579
actually true to check that the Koran

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,860
bytes operating this will install it

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,840
with my command from yeah and so

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,549
following them but this is very we

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,930
started through actually when

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,220
programming because you know as a

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,840
beginner you would think that the most

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,480
part will be learning the basic syntax

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,310
really stuff like that oh boy was I

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,200
wrong was actually you really only need

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,110
to set things up and misfolding the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,850
dependence

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,940
necessary things to actually get it

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:30,950
running on so when it first problems

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:32,060
that we had was actually yes I believe

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,950
you guys would know that

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,720
yeah the wrinkled my face was custom

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,980
getting the message there recognizes

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,470
maternal eyes don't man what so you know

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,060
the next thing I did was definitely cool

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,710
a bunch of stop and it turns out I just

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,820
had it to that bit to the path variable

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:53,660
right so you know choppers me I guess

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:56,180
essentially this is command lines who at

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,190
this much bit which is default installed

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,500
in this directory to the Packard boy

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,770
you'll be able to use it instead and

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,390
just enjoy that people's actually editor

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,060
durable and there's the newest version

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,950
just read like a version 10 and

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,070
university knows 20 points return to be

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,350
right and so but I guess you know I

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,620
already have a problem like this and

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,320
actually you know not knowing or making

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,700
a mistake of syntax already despite

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,660
having they were just refreshing than

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:30,380
Python except I did so as you can see

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,450
here it is this I could give me a heart

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,820
attack now because I was thinking about

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,860
what went wrong it's just since had

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,150
several a quick packets or discreetly

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,880
but I shouldn't have and so the next

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,430
thing that I learned was actually an

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,340
accident and I believe this is like the

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,590
programmers component 1 error message I

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,570
believe you people never go in this

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,020
error message now you're not considered

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,600
a programmer right so essentially what

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,580
happened here is honestly I did not know

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,470
much about this but there's a twisted

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:08,020
farm that had to be pre-installed

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,020
 install screen you know so

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,600
next thing to do was to tell mr. farlan

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,460
okay it's nothing at all trying to

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,650
create stop that and we want to install

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:23,150
screaming except this happened if you

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,150
guys recall just like a couple of

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,950
pictures back there was the newest

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,490
freshman right somewhat seeming things

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:38,180
yeah this somehow happened and at this

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:39,920
point I talk so yeah everything well and

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,040
this one I really started to doubt in

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,910
their positions device maybe there's

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,610
another way to do it

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,670
he knows and so eventually I

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,370
troubleshoot that by just you know

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,290
really instantly rehydrating keep to the

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,060
new expression and so the next thing

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,450
that I kind of learned in was actually

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,950
this pretty shot soon so I served on the

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,080
screen beyond so you really this is an

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,420
interactive tool so this really helped

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,490
me where he's not here because I had no

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,200
idea at all how he uses he has expenses

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,320
and those attached to some type of

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,300
record it'll interact and just this ends

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,730
have a very practical example

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:25,630
howdy whose name and earning enough so

00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:31,070
as you can see in here is the page and

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,600
that's always I was so happy because we

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,850
didn't know the amount of effort I keep

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,010
trying to discuss the legal error

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,770
messages in the bottom so this was

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,360
really a huge step for me and so next

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,120
thing I talk about is actually revision

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,090
student Lee because you know as you all

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,490
know it's not really simple idea to

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,350
actually write a couple of complex

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,140
points of codes on the comment on itself

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:58,040
rabbit so the best thing to do is to get

00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,690
a source code editor which is to you

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,690
know write the algorithm first before

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,600
assuming as a following and afterwards

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:09,770
you know running in our content oh yeah

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,590
so finally

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,440
after three months of you know

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,440
painstakingly learning Python all right

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,340
installing it you know maybe these

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,280
things like that right every single tool

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,400
and of course just no tabs are pretend

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,450
to catch up to 10 tabs of online

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,510
Krauss's I finally came up 14 lines of

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,140
functional good and at this point it

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,140
just felt like that

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:49,339
I'm a coder yeah so you know and and so

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:52,190
this actually it's two results right you

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,920
know essentially our greater consensus

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,930
and I wouldn't be here if your throat

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,390
insults because essentially it's dis

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,100
concept I don't mean to me everything

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,320
actually behind from learning nothing

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,779
about three months I'd imagine you come

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,880
over for a functional cause and in fact

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,360
to be honest to go back you're a little

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,730
too curious

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,800
yeah to the previous page memo to refine

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,690
our written if you ask me to explain

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,260
your time cutting in mountainous lines

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,060
of code annoyed actually can you just

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,240
obviously the only thing I understood is

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,610
reliable is two responses apart but you

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,520
know whichever shows how great open

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,480
sauce is because essentially if you see

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,250
here it's greatly itself has an entire

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,649
documentation in this other line from

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,959
you just to follow and the other this

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,230
trick it a little too despondent one and

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,240
eventually inserted only one so really

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,750
in a sense I'm really grateful each one

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,010
of our innocence comes out here and so

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,110
now just show you guys a big

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,920
demonstration of how it lays how it

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,240
actually works it on so yeah I mean so

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,089
the first thing about witness of command

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,570
Pro and then the CD to sorry we're going

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:13,200
to be

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:14,580
for environment that created this right

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,060
and from here

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:22,170
direct into the file I probably should

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,160
have saved it and I'll follow it's

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,160
easier to accessory

00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:41,739
okay and finally yes and so from here

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,989
remember I'll be under the class

00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:46,859
attribute I actually named this putter

00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:50,079
for following our attention so over here

00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:52,419
how to excessive would just be simply

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,959
try to commence creepy crawl and then

00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,069
able to spider which is scheduled you

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:02,369
didn't help me dinner and they'll just

00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:02,369
take it as a data file on your CSV and

00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:11,889
so yeah pepper

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:13,539
everybody on your right here yeah so I

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:20,439
said she as you can see here it

00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:23,439
basically scrape all the things of a

00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:27,459
channel and eventually eventually source

00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:30,159
code editor there it is safe under a CSV

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,589
file with her thermistor and the best

00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,589
part of it all

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,589
where's

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,320
yeah okay

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:50,270
it was commented we stay as Paul wanted

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:53,570
me and so there we go I'm ready to put a

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,910
career down yeah so it's the best way to

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,650
learn all the magic effort vacation is

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:09,230
when entitling skilled from scratch

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:11,150
right yeah so dad yeah and regret I

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,580
would just go back to before the

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,700
conclusion to my talking law by having

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:21,530
disassembled picture of the expectations

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:23,480
versus the reality of coding as you can

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,600
see am I on my right

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:31,160
provide an elderly lady I run a check on

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:34,760
the life and rivers so there we go

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,370
so it isn't confusion it's it's just

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,140
well running for any amount from scratch

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,570
it's actually not as hard as people to

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,400
think and it's you know it's much easier

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,870
in these days because again thanks to

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,210
deep concept powers to quickly sense

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,800
about and so I guess you know for anyone

00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,570
here who wants to get into programming

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,270
and all my mother than from scratch I

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,940
say just go ahead over it it may sound

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,320
scary not knowing any programming or

00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,790
anything at all really

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:07,610
let's go ahead and doing the hardest

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:20,060
parts we just get started you know from

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:27,950
old age so I get one for a time yeah so

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:31,000
fun you think I did well hey but on the

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:40,150
bright side I can code I don't know

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:44,200
oh right before oh sorry yeah dance

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:46,600
actually commanded to write it over here

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:53,860
so any sense that is sort of like

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:58,140
command for scraping - yeah the command

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,140
you say way you will need to do yeah

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,190
that's critical assess the command

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,190
[Music]

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:53,170
questions yeah maybe maybe remote

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:55,230
retraction I should probably yeah thank

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,230
you

00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,370
