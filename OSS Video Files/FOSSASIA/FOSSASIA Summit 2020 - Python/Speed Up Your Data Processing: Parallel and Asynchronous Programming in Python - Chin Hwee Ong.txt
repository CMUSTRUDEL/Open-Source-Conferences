Description: 
	(Apologies for the abrupt cut)

In a data science project, one of the biggest bottlenecks (in terms of time) is the constant wait for the data processing code to finish executing. Slow code, as well as connectivity issues, affect every step of a typical data science workflow — be it for event-driven I/O operations or computation-driven workloads. Through real-life analogies based on my experience in a young data science team getting started with real-world data, I will be exploring the use of parallel and asynchronous programming in Python to speed up your data processing pipelines so that you could focus more on getting value out of your data.

Oh people in the life you can see me

00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:09,450
yeah of course people in the room today

00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:12,990
today I hope this is back on track and

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,450
yeah I hope everyone had a breakfast so

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,090
I wish video on I hold it too tight

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,800
speedier they are professing using a

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,369
synchronous process programming in

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,160
Python so yeah

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,510
my name is cheese me and I am video

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,699
let's get in the ring

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,349
so by back so a cup of background in

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,320
aerospace engineering as well as

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,960
competition and modeling and I stopped

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,790
myself into the data kinetics so

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,180
contributed to a task on this asteroid

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,280
in the documentation and I also wanted

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,860
them a high vessel been an eventful 15 X

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,550
Wow they not for me is with workshops or

00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,629
did I educate me

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:05,100
so so a typical workflow alright alright

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,470
so this is because I so us we extract

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,260
the raw data and then we process the

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,659
data after which we going to feel about

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,320
finding a model and then we I know where

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,220
everything is mine we defy the water so

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,030
seems to be quite straightforward right

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:27,150
but unfortunately usually there will be

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,759
some bottlenecks in the fertile you just

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,869
so it could be a little data or the

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,420
dinner would be of poor quality but

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:38,640
usually like most of the time that was

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,170
the main bottleneck for any leaders I

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,210
pretend is data processing so like those

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,350
people they demand like to say that oh

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,479
it's a tea

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,070
in twenties fine but in actual fact is

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,790
actually it closed up with magnet band

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,790
an 80/20 yeah so that's why I have a job

00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,479
so if I saw in data science we call

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,030
language is Python so we use a lot and

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:17,130
then usually where we start factor and

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,630
we started forward so yeah I think the

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,730
power is that your photos right under

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:26,160
interpreter is not compact soil and yeah

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,280
all those high done is actually your

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,720
tops well then like the difference is

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,830
that C is actually are running on a

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,570
compound by done it's like interpreting

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,360
the variables and stuff and then you

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:44,400
have the over there so smart so whatever

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,970
C so it is so simple to me but in famous

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,680
disco

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,019
so how to do so as well

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I tell introduce the concept of this

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,680
comprehensions

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,320
so this conversion is studied as an

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,600
apology cause you do not need to keep

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:07,950
opening your monkey were tourists at

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:12,090
every iteration and plus you know Smith

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,560
right right yeah it's one line it looks

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,299
nice the little spinner and you don't

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:23,269
need to keep saying for a cappella

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:27,090
function but oh it's not quite the past

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:29,940
so that's fine you have the guys from

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,040
vendors who we're trying to optimize

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,750
convert such that they are using a bit

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,239
of the goods they laugh about see and

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,220
the goods of our vendors and they and

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,130
the optimism for a memory analytics

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,440
using the first ending theorems so they

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,860
don't really happen but they are sort of

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,950
trying to I'd never concept a fighter so

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,410
and that is cool for your delight and

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,599
the in fact I it's now a very library

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:59,989
right there when it comes to

00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:04,049
slightly bigger data we miss an issue so

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,299
just last week my Dennis ideas ask me

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,329
write about no regular data and he

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,909
complained that when he knew the data he

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:14,790
runs out of memory

00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:18,349
how am I gonna really talk and they said

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:21,359
that's just one country it is say that

00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,669
while it's like or so slow is there a

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,849
way for me to speed up by Redick

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:28,530
operations so when you are dealing with

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,770
like larger data sets they are what I

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,570
want give I you tend to run out of tiny

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,280
right into performance and album

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:41,639
reissues which hand us is like hennas

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,620
would not be sufficient for you to solve

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,919
your data processing issues no okay so

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,389
if i run my if i run in the province

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,900
music hi guys

00:04:51,389 --> 00:05:01,470
and the poster say this father wonderful

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,250
day like it that's true yeah it's like

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:09,270
that we need now alright big dinner but

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:12,330
it's not so high so it doesn't mean that

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,070
like just because you a big data you or

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:21,289
just you need to use this faster because

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:25,169
good thing anyone knows what's puppies I

00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:29,220
mean just the course file that I have I

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,289
have I saw right now I woke up it up and

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,280
I run my code what I was fighting I have

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:39,270
multiple computers running the code at

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,889
the same time by then to be able to run

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,830
for a same time they also need to

00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,820
communicate with each other and anyone

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,050
you know that I trying to communicate

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,560
with from my corner because of course I

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:56,039
try to attach my gosh I was FSH message

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,949
to your phone and then you will have a

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,400
delay so that this communication where

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,280
he

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,910
then it's the same thing for master your

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,610
computers need to communicate across

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:13,030
across the network and that is not their

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,130
net is usually always a major openings

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,950
so that's one thing and another thing

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,190
and I'll try to do it is there you know

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,790
they can be big but it may not be big

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,300
enough to justify those faster so just

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:34,250
been so okay so so what I will refer to

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,010
talk by Del Phi Theta by Tim OTT the -

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,910
Corrine so he brought the concept of

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:45,830
small big data where my god is too big

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:48,140
to fit in memory but it's too small to

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,570
the device but Roscoe because you have

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,120
to set up a spectrometer you have to web

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,290
you have to make sure when it and then

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,510
at the end of the day you realize that

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,510
it's not working it's simply not working

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:06,170
so what would be the intermediate

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,850
solution so I don't want to help me

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,480
that's right so what I have got people

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,670
computers finding my cool so that comes

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,620
the question of like what is parallel

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:20,780
testing be is depressing oh yeah people

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,400
so I shall not go over the definition

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,740
because it's over in the morning

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,630
but estimated day I were in yeah :

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:34,610
maybe but what I'm knocking which are

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:36,470
called so my toes right is me - all it's

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:42,620
like I'm trying to make it like all

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:46,430
mimic order one booster for sliced bread

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,580
and at each time of course I I'm going

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,900
to enjoy I see I do is to me it's nice

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,800
and brown crispy and I assume that

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,800
there's nobody time

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,099
that way there when you really do

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,649
rotated okay is the equation says the

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:13,949
guy maybe a hundred sizes all prayer

00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:20,399
because I might become a popular I I

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:22,529
love you got to keep prayer and I push

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,020
through the oven so that in this case I

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:28,289
your up your no style other right it's

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,740
like a processor I know what color and

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:34,680
then then after you go through the work

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:39,870
to ride the poster you get hundreds nice

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,209
as well oh well if I go ahead take the

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,060
bread I go and put in a steel toaster

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:47,940
and then take it out and then put your

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,670
side and then do a hundred times this is

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,319
how much time it takes enemies 20

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:58,040
minutes I think I first I was run away

00:08:52,319 --> 00:09:01,459
with me but if I took her what I sitting

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:05,880
safely I have a hundred sizes of bread

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:08,189
and right now I go SB into four patches

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,490
on one bed to bed free backward batch

00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:14,730
each batch 25 toast I go and buy four

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,459
coasters and then every time I go and

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,259
put or I go and put the bread I into

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,930
your photos Thurston and then so I say

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,370
okay we need to release instead of just

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:31,019
one toes right now I have photos and

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,029
consider that actually running in

00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:36,360
parallel and yucky me better or each

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,970
other so which means that if my toes is

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,290
a bit over steam it doesn't really have

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,649
any other coasters and then finally the

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,480
output of your toasting process is

00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:54,319
consolidated and I returned as like an

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:57,269
overall food so yeah okay Donna and and

00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:58,690
then and and you don't know where those

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,139
are so you don't really

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,860
whatever one so in terms of the

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:08,259
execution time I you see her toes to

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:13,810
minute I ordered those but I know I

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:15,490
divide across a lot of stuff so it's tip

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,779
off by taking very very low right now I

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:22,629
process that one I mean II don't even

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:26,889
have a toast so it's quite so it's ready

00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:27,910
going you should so now I thought about

00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,649
thanks

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:34,810
fair enough for that they are no I drop

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:38,470
you about seekers versus se perhaps what

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,889
do I need my first synchronous the tower

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:45,610
synchronous for time so yeah corner

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:48,040
honest of course they also copy whatever

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,170
because I want to work in a mock because

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,589
time by K it's what attached yet not

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,990
cool so I will go make coffee that's our

00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:00,069
first day why wouldn't appear I can do

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:05,500
other stuff like check my phone crack

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:07,509
some eggs make samples brew coffee and

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,149
coffee machine sorry

00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:14,050
I just stand there and wait for the

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:17,560
coffee to be done five minutes and then

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:22,720
after the coffee is done then I go up in

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:25,930
my toes so five minutes for copy to

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,019
finish my toes then just to make a cup

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:34,740
of tea and toast arrived I think seven

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:38,589
minutes I don't wasto Colleoni

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,110
less if I do the vesicular swear I mean

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:43,089
well I am brew my coffee which actually

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,970
a stronger that we here Rosa I could

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:49,000
make some toast then

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,620
our coffee is still runny I take you

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,949
five minutes and my toast takes two

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,439
minutes

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:55,839
I can I can make my toast question so

00:11:53,439 --> 00:12:01,389
after five minutes I have to toast and a

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:03,170
copy yeah better than a better day away

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:06,340
where we realized I guess

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:11,390
as I said several minutes just waiting

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:14,650
so that's the photo distress wow there's

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:20,180
a lot of sexy type I still outside but

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:25,360
no hey baby I am frying 256 for an SPI

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,360
everything but is that really the case

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,590
but what's my the real world is sound

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,880
right the capacity which is requested

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,860
are number one is already organized

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,420
sometimes right if you are still using

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,620
of course a copy need a doc who stole

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,550
something you might even retake your

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,490
approach in hybrid approach so let's say

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,550
you sell these computers don't use for

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,230
rule

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,440
secondly it could be a bomb attack each

00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,500
other

00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:04,790
hi I mean if I have if I just doing just

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,520
having a boxer like okay I wasn't

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,220
thinking I just do a same thing I can

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,040
toggle this up then and then they don't

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,800
rely on each other okay we fell to the

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,110
parallel paralyzing a pet collective job

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,630
in Palestine where they give up is them

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,180
all those are core idea would Otto's

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,850
processor right it would depend on each

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,340
other then you will have to consider how

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,970
to structure your course arcade you can

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,700
actually do a prayer paralyzing and

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,980
usually it's not a very good idea but

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,960
it's not just about like it's not as

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,170
about how much everything in the bottom

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,910
is explore you need consider whether the

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,010
tasks are independent of each other and

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:51,350
one other tech guys independent of each

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:55,060
other and on top of the world also think

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,680
about the color here imperialism first

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,690
the rule of parallelism is number one

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,300
program parallelism is that there will

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,360
always be part of the work that cannot

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,639
be paralyzed so this this is known as

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,250
I'm not long that's all I have

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,220
there will always be part of your code

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,779
that cannot be paralyzed so even if the

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,860
sixth course is talk about a soccer

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:23,769
problem and on holiday you also need

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,779
extra time recording and debugging your

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:29,199
code such that you can move from

00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:32,250
sequential parallel so they will

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,660
increase capacity to October and

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,519
tomorrow after you optimize it they will

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,540
still be system overhead equally

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,610
complicated for him

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,670
so remember I talked about spot faster

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:46,480
but you have to communicate across your

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,279
computes in this case right yes it's not

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,040
so bad because you are communicating

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,170
reading on top you but still you have

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,329
your Dominic your communication between

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,889
your course is to go to editable over

00:14:55,329 --> 00:15:02,320
here and not for business and those long

00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:05,440
restated the this Authority go speed up

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,850
is defined by this function so I'm just

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,290
talking about your attica it's not even

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,279
about the practical speed up yet

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,620
Torretta carry if they don't parallel

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:20,260
paths at all cost is zero absolute zero

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,160
if open a parallel yeah right it will be

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,140
bility but easy but we don't have them

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,860
so usually house PR we limited by the

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,320
fraction of a word that can paralyze

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,440
so if you fail you might avoid expensive

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,170
to one of the six cone machine I'm not

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,970
going to get a stag Linea improvement it

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:45,699
even 550 600 prom so you can look at the

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,160
track so you can see that this type of

00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:52,930
that ring in terms of how much you guys

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,399
now know and then that's set all

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,010
together so there's two types of

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
parameter that we can actually use on

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:03,040
its body processing and one is body

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,930
trading so multi processing is I you are

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,050
doing very little across multiple

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,390
processors using multiple processors so

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,480
it's so I run in mud

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:17,770
processors using multiple only put

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:21,370
posters in my campaign what what the

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,950
trailer is it's executed multiple tress

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,350
of some protesters at the same time we

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,790
did a signal professor so-and-so and

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:36,520
about me I say I have a suppressor which

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:45,220
is two and then once I got something

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:48,760
they do something else so because of the

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:53,410
nature of how naughty positive or 30s

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:57,070
but it really is best suited I hope not

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:00,070
if a trial process large parts of data

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,410
like hope digital heavy star it was a

00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:09,070
better idea to use multiple processors

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:12,040
rather than one for stress because why

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,150
why is it the case because what they

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,970
thought was a snake has to be you know

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:21,370
home to let's see so usually they do a

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,440
map function or try to calculate

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:25,900
something

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,750
it has do if I could keep switching

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,990
between the tress right just for my

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:35,730
operation it will become increasingly

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:38,950
inefficient and to add to your problems

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:44,910
Python has the G hi al yeah the G I have

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:48,010
eroded it so they can help these people

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,770
because doesn't allow you to do your

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,960
money trading

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,150
yeah first you all right you have a lot

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,330
of money trail so it does not allow

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:01,420
parallel execution

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,470
so it's okay so I can do parallel

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:08,860
execution so how do I do

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,480
heard of a behind Allah and lost ever

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,029
doing a sequel first year I don't want

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,820
to wait for something

00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:16,820
and then to be falling to the next task

00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:25,710
so well we do have some question is

00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:27,989
actually quite okay they do have a full

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,779
current you just bought you reading yeah

00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:34,889
haha media factor itself which is a

00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:37,830
higher API launching a synchronous

00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:40,799
parallel tasks first attorney so this is

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,479
if you introduce a prodigy point to know

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,129
that we are finally for a trainee so

00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:49,169
this body is a really like yes

00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:52,159
Otis so it's an aperture video quality

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:54,869
processing so the Toboso execution

00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:58,830
disturb process for and attract always

00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:01,679
good and then we look at the fattest and

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,899
alive in why the state like what's the

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,479
difference between precise cool and trap

00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:08,940
whole so-called process who you have

00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,519
shall to travel there goes into a lot

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,279
more chunks and I started up a task and

00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,940
then you actually improve your

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,129
performance

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,509
what about what it's reading it doesn't

00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:23,509
we need it doesn't really give you the

00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,509
thumbs

00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:29,519
then remember that we talked about early

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,859
trading and naughty protesting so so

00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,379
about process who execute is a body with

00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,649
the same track who execute that is your

00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:39,330
multi threading so those process who

00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,489
execute all user starting with the same

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,809
in Versailles step that URL which

00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:46,619
mistake you don't need to worry about

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:49,200
what ready issues but controversy could

00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,589
not you still need to worry about CIL

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,649
ghosted you need to be concerned about

00:19:51,589 --> 00:20:02,070
locking so that is the difference

00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:06,570
between the two s filters in this module

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:08,759
we have in this particular module as

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,149
difficult or something which protect as

00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:15,820
important function as always is import

00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:18,200
album on anything with those of you

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,240
that will represent the execution of the

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,049
function so I saw Isaac your Papa is

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,559
basically a representation of a function

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:31,480
board your fashion executing each of

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,490
each of them as O'Mara

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,610
disputa it is similar to the map

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,910
function in Python so it takes input

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,920
your caller function the urk run and

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,170
then after as a list where each element

00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,730
in the list will input your background

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:52,370
and our inventors is is that it director

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,380
they will you the result of the cultures

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,620
being applied to every element of this

00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,940
so that is that I run my secret out of

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,799
memory I don't get them talking they

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,500
leave I would have to extract the

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:08,540
results from the executor to store it

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:11,540
away so okay so one of one of the cases

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,030
that I would be like an F whenever I

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,460
operation so in this case I would like

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,190
to extract some data from that every

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,870
time we weather readings so I am sorry

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,820
so the most part of me that your

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,220
subjects are coming so like calling the

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,730
API finding pool as well who the data

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,000
API that's what I finished asked about

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,610
you

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,299
okay for trading right so I am sorry as

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:38,299
I kept reading why do I need the trading

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:41,510
because I will need to run it by API

00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:45,770
website which shrek is the a parent

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:49,850
because right on and I wish that

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:54,410
assumption I like my toast but I check

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,730
by rail and then okay I spy these

00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:59,510
corporations because these corporations

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:04,460
is the better is a good way in by

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:09,740
tonight then if I use disk operations it

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:13,790
takes almost 17 minutes to whole like to

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:16,790
be hundred API requests I think I can

00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:20,059
eat a meal to be the time but if I do

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,630
strap OSE filter to execute the API

00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,890
depends

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:28,720
I actually get a speed-up of about 20 21

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:34,700
times so I start in less than a minute

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,320
yeah it's actually a minute and then now

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,670
another case would be of what image what

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,440
I say something because I thought you

00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,360
meet with us say hi our images would be

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,440
quite day and we try to us we will try

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,560
to size it up to to defy temperature so

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,340
that we can actually train our model so

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,570
in this case why how they are say

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,440
contains the images of different

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,970
dimensions

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,520
some have been a really long line

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,600
something we're very small but need to

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:07,220
unit we need to standardize them so same

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,650
thing I initialize my modules I wish I

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,830
could define a process that I want to

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,760
run on all the images so in this case I

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,680
used

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,660
oh and get PID to run into the

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,360
processing solution what I'm trying to

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,550
monitor the processor so it's different

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,380
from when the product reverse case

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,650
whereby I am actually trying to monitor

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,410
the transcription now as usual I

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,170
initialized by Wow initialize what I

00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,570
want to process so this is a about

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:39,560
thousand hundred thirty one images to

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:42,260
process so if I use no in this case

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,860
right this request is fairly straight

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:49,400
forward for us who's there first it so I

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:52,400
hope I pray I should a toy toaster and I

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,040
get Thomas so my computer in this case

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,660
is an image I try to precisely take it

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:03,050
out so make sure fine make true because

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,520
intuitive I guess one thousand thousand

00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:08,090
asked me just in this very night before

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,650
eight seconds imagine that it also has

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:14,910
like a lot more images like 100

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:17,490
oh let's try these contractions because

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:23,130
it's the device Widow tubes are in

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:27,150
tighten so much mentally also around

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:33,540
symmetry but if I use process for a

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:37,890
signature I and SN map function and and

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,660
and I'm using an echo machine I can

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,210
visually process I would a thousand

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:48,990
images in just let the seller second

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:52,560
that is effectively a 0.3 times Villa so

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,540
so so now you can see how contributions

00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,510
actually speed up your data processing

00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:00,620
so some key takeaways yeah

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:03,900
no awkwardness I should be paralyzed

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:07,080
accountable way it's always remember and

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,430
US law a lot better as this is the

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,900
overhead such as a communication

00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:15,440
overhead this and most importantly if

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,270
the cost of rewriting your whole

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,720
population or exit with a time series

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:26,010
they can get maybe your device very

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,200
small there may be testing of other ways

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,720
to paralyze Arcola like there are other

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,690
ways of magical rod like this

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,380
comprehensions and I thought they

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,510
stopped using for loops use other ways

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:46,380
to optimize your code to speed up the

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:50,060
same yeah so hey so here's follow me and

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,060
you can find my slide on

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,320
thank you she does anyone have any

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,320
questions

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:22,330
yes cause if I'm a possibility our

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,460
ability with us please

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:34,660
that prevents him from became like so

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:36,340
many just actually right this respect

00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,610
this is related to one another

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,440
protection I'm trying to three years

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:47,440
robot theta so imagine the response

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:51,900
thousand plus it also does the API is

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:56,470
actually these are more occupations

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,480
imported Ada and you display so for that

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:07,090
though there are top if you I was fine

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:11,320
but then if I am yes I am in a personal

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:14,370
so I want to be able to get into the raw

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,630
data and trying analyzing for myself I

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,800
don't

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:24,640
yeah there are every builder entire

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:26,380
stockpile I will prefer to work on the

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,059
raw data and find out myself

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,840
still be Donnelly we like what they

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,840
gotta has already

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,210
no you have to correct its cloning API

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,210
so my suspicion is probably going to be

00:27:46,050 --> 00:28:11,610
probably do you think there was sitting

00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:17,670
by at least are any other questions for

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:17,670
