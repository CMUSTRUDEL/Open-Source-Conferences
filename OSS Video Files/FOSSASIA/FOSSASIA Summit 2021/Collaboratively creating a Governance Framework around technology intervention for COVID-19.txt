hi

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,400
thank you for making time today to join

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
this conversation

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,519
my name is shankarshan and i'm a

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
volunteer at the coffee credentials

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
initiative which is also called

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
cci so what i'm going to do today is

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
share

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,119
our experience in creating what we call

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,720
a template governance framework

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,519
around digital and technology

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,599
interventions to the covet pandemic

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,679
now if you were attending the blockchain

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,279
panel that happened last monday

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,800
you would have heard brian belinda of

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
remark on how

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,399
governance framework is an important

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
part of deployments

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,040
and here through our conversations we

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,520
might actually see why

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
the indeed are very important as we

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,239
deploy

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
these technologies to real-life

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,840
situations

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,920
so cca came together as a loose

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
coalition of interested and enthusiastic

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,879
individuals organizations

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,680
around 300 individuals 100 organizations

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,440
way back in april 20 2020 so the early

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,479
days of the pandemic

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,119
since then very recently in december uh

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,720
2020 cci has become part of the linux

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,040
foundation public health

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,280
and continues its advocacy for privacy

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,320
preserving verifiable credentials

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
and with focus on mitigating the spread

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,600
of the pandemic

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
and incidentally through evolving

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,560
conversations we're also looking at

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,560
beyond this cut and pandemic as well

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
uh it's a quick rundown of things we're

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,200
going to discuss today

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
um so the gopher pandemic if you

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
remember

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
covet 19 was declared as a pandemic

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
sometime around mid-march

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,040
and pretty much immediately there was a

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
number of conversations in various

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
forums about how to blend technology

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
interventions

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,720
bring technology as solutions create an

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,479
impact

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
designing technology interventions

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,920
around health status

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
coffee test results was around enabling

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
individuals to have access to

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,439
services businesses basically

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
trying to get back to what we then used

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439
to call

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,119
the normal but it also soon included

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,080
topics of digital passports

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,000
vaccination status and even there's a

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
whole good body of work around

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,040
electronic health records including data

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
sharing

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,520
what the cca effort did was it brought

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,560
together people in domains of identity

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
self-serving identity technology public

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,280
health services to be able

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,959
to figure out how there is

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,400
element of notice concept

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,200
and choice in how data is shared data is

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,800
used and data is verified

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,640
so uh the use cases into the cca

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,560
was organized around various work

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,239
streams the use cases and tooling work

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
stream was among the few workstations

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,519
which

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,680
uh started having phenomenally

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
engaging con presentations from startups

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
businesses individuals who

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,080
just brought a fresh round of

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,120
perspectives on various aspects of a

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,159
citizen's journey to this system

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,760
you would recall that in a lot of ways

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,760
those early days there was a whole lot

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,560
of conversation around what the journey

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
looks like what

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,319
use workflows look like what are the

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,440
user experience

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,120
uh design patterns and all of that so in

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,519
our in our case in cci

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
concepts like trust registries verifying

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,760
the verifier

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,799
or to be able to

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,879
understand the security around

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
verification process local assurance

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,120
communities

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,519
all brought out the need for what we

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,120
call a templates governance framework

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,200
so what we did was uh we inherited

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
a governance framework uh from the

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,840
sovereign foundation we started off with

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
that because

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
this is already used by the sovereign

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,120
foundation to run this often mean it

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,040
and it provides the identifier services

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,720
so this was a reference frame for

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,319
topics and principles uh we needed to do

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
this quick so we set up an aggressive

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,959
target

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,879
a timeline of 60 days in which to

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
produce the first version of the cci

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,799
governance framework

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,879
we created specific roles like editors

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,840
primary as secondary reviewers

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,519
expert reviewers and in went through

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
cycles of week two week meetings

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
including sidebar conversations to be

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,720
able to get us to an early

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,440
first release in june so we started off

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
somewhat around

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,360
april by the time it's june we already

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,320
had version 1. release

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,240
now the other thing that we did was that

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
we also produced traditional language

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,400
versions

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
besides the english version that we had

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
and the

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,040
interesting thing that happened is that

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
the translation activity helped clarify

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,320
some of the technical concepts

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,639
and actually ended up making the

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,320
language version in english

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,720
much better simplified so

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
this the release of the version one got

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
us to a

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
feedback cycle and one of the key

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,560
feedback received from early

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
adopters was that they would prefer to

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
remove

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
ambiguity in the principles in order to

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,759
create better policies

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
and this allowed us to create a way we

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,800
can

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,320
actually uh improve on the next version

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,720
now i think we this all this activity

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,440
that happened then and continues

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
has allowed us to present a good set of

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,720
things that we can share

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,400
the key is about the human experience

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
keeping technology is something that

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520
enables the social

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,400
situation rather than allowing it to

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,320
dominate over the social situation

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,320
but more importantly to be able to

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,000
engage with adopters

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,880
and sponsors with a clear expectation

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,039
that the first

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
version is not the final version it's

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,199
not etched in stone

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,320
it would go through refactoring it would

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,759
go through refinement

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
it would go through changes and

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,560
modifications primarily because

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
as we were doing all of this the science

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
and policy around

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
all the pieces around the pandemic like

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
the

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
immuno immunities

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,560
status vaccination all of this was

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,560
evolving

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,720
so this means that domain experts engage

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
in frontline activities like we had

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
a good amount of participation from

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,880
folks who were involved engaged with the

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,639
nhs

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
and this allowed this was critical

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,680
because it kept us on the straight path

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,400
and we didn't quite get sidetracked by

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,400
the

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
the key curry and the nerd fascination

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,000
that often

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
happens in such cases but the most

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
important thing that we

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,240
think is that gets us going and or

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
got us going to be able to deliver what

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
we did

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
is that we focused on getting the

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,319
purpose and the scope

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,440
correct now the

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,960
thing about getting that correct is

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
to be able to evaluate all further

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,919
progress

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,680
in terms of whether it can be in scope

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,039
or out scope does it serve the purpose

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
or does it not

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
does it help the direction that we chose

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
to

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
walk down or does it not i think that's

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
one of the key things

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
that to keep in mind if you're trying to

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
do a similar exercise

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,240
so

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,039
the other thing that we ended up

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,400
focusing on through all the activities

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
is

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,080
putting a spotlight on inclusion equity

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,720
and accessibility

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
are the principles that are included in

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
this

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,360
governance framework ensure that we are

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,479
able to provide guidance that are make

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
these topics

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,080
are fundamental when considering digital

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,440
interventions

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,039
so we we see that when we read opinions

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,919
that with digital passports which

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,599
highlight the

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,080
various drawbacks around these topics

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,639
including surveillance coercion

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,440
and so we knew we wanted to address

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,879
topics of

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,759
these topics as well with by bringing in

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
ideas around

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,199
data sovereignty data governance data

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,800
rights as they are applicable to the

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,080
local jurisdictions

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,919
and we what we now see

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
happening extensively is the digital

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
credentials and situations that involve

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,680
large ecosystems like for instance you

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,360
you might have heard about the good el

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,879
pas and the iata

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
and others coming together to form

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,039
consortiums now uh

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,479
this essentially are large digital trust

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,080
ecosystems

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,599
that cross boundaries uh so

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,680
essentially it requires a lot us a

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,800
variety of organizations to trust the

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,719
issues of these

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,159
verifiable credentials and verifiable

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
representations

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
and have a way of transitive trust put

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
in

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,599
uh this slide is essentially a quick

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,839
updates on what's happening

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,000
as well as a call to action we really

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,399
really would like to have

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
more specific uh participation from

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,760
policy makers individuals who are

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
involved in standard development

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,320
organizations to be able to join us

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,880

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,959
governance framework now if you are

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
engaged in or are planning to design

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,120
governance frameworks for such efforts

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,279
