	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,839
thank you very much for joining everyone

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,960
and yeah it's it's great to see you guys

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,280
good to see you good to see you

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,880
morning evening and afternoon yeah

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,720
exactly that's what i wanted to say so

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,000
we're covering the entire world

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,720
now then expanding a bit and uh

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,119
yeah thank you very much hon folk for

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,000
introducing our panel

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,160
and basically this panel is a follow-up

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
also on the panel that we had a few

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
months ago

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
at state of the source but the questions

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,480
always

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,239
remain the same and yeah i would like to

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,640
um yeah invite you guys um

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,840
at first to share a bit like what is the

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
current state

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
um of open source firmware and open

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,600
hardware then

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,600
from your perspective and as we had

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,960
hadn't heard uh

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,719
like at our last panel from bunny and i

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,520
would like to

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
yeah have like an opening statement of

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
bunny

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,000
um bunny like how are things developing

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,720
with the

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,200
open source firmware and hardware do you

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,240
feel

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
things are opening up entirely or um

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,640
like

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,439
yeah is it maybe different well i mean

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
it's uh

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,479
there's a constant tension of a lot of

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,240
players in the market a lot of

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
motivations right so i think the open

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,640
source technology

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
continues to make really strong strides

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
and i think

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,400
there are people who are listening to

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,360
our message and taking it seriously

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
and then there's people who i think have

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,799
a motivation to

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,079
keep it closed right but i think i think

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,680
overall the the

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
the the general state of things is

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
pretty good um i'm seeing a lot of

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,159
progress

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
on a lot of fronts i'm more on the

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,640
hardware side so i've been

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,119
um pretty pleased with the uh

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,560
sort of incredible momentum that's

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,119
developing on open source silicon

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
actually

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640
so people are now uh actually battling

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,040
down and getting the

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,240
actual transistor level stuff opened up

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
on chips

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,759
and the physical design kits are getting

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,280
opened up and people are really excited

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,879
in that area so i'm looking forward to

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
seeing a lot of um

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,959
you know action along that front which

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,720
is sort of the final frontier

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
you know in on the hardware side of

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
things we we always argue about what's

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
inside of our socs and

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
we can't see what's on the inside and

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
hopefully that problem will get solved

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,560
um

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
in the next decade or so

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,319
so i i think there's some control

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
controversial

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,080
statement maybe behind that but because

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
things are opening

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
up but i think we will talk a little bit

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,560
later um how are they opening up and who

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
are maybe the actors

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,840
in this um yeah

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,840
sure activity and yeah so

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,040
then thank you very much and um

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,159
i would like then go to uh

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,000
jean-marie jean-marie

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:05,200
so you also had some news in the last

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,080
few months where you also um had some

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
experience

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
would you like to share uh what has been

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,400
happening on your side

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
yeah um since we spoke last time so we

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,519
we've made some tremendous progress at

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
supporting your consortium we're on

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,720
parliament family

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,319
so which is

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,319
the hpe x86 server line so we started to

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,440
ship

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
servers to customers with uh open source

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,319
jamware capabilities

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
um running open bmc and linux boot

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,920
so which means that we are getting

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,879
closer and closer to support open source

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,959
firmware

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,120
we we are doing that currently on

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,440
private offering but our intent is to

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,040
expand as much as we can this

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
this product portfolio and we do support

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
um

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
systems running intel chips and emd

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,360
chips so which are which was also

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,200
critical to us

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,879
and we open up an integrated continuous

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
integration platform which is an online

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
tool

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,640
that anybody around the world can use to

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,760
validate a consortium where on proliant

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,680
um we we faced a couple of challenges

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,319
that we try to address on a daily basis

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,639
and that's also why this is not um

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
available on the worldwide pc so we need

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
to read that

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,600
our support process and um and

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,840
enhance the hardware uh just to be able

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
to switch back and forward between a

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,320
proprietary firmware and open source

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
firmware

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,560
so we do not want to have a black and

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
white world where a customer is

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,240
locked with open source firmware or

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,919
locked with proprietary firmware we just

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,880
want to be able to offer the

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,360
the widest choice and um and this is

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
where

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,479
uh it is becoming tricky and um and the

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,560
past to success might be taking um

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,720
let's say a couple of months or a couple

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
of years additional years of work just

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
to be sure that everything is set up

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,280
properly but

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
we're quite happy about what happened

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
despite the pandemic which slowed down a

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,840
lot of

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,960
our efforts during the past few months

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
and um because you're also like talking

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,840
from the perspective of uh we

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,120
right but so you have been active on on

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,440
different uh

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
fronts let's say so when you're talking

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,240
about we like

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,120
which groups do you for example

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
feel you can represent and and like how

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
how do

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,479
the different perspective perspective

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,440
right now what i'm saying we this is

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,639
mostly the

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
hpe engineering team so and the people

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
who are

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,000
um designing a consortium where hpe and

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
but also the open source communities

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,199
from from open bmc

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,520
so we we officially

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
committed code to the open bmc stream to

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,120
support the hp

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,639
gxp asic so hp is still designing its

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,800
own bmc chip

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,479
and with the security stack associated

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,039
to it and we upstream that

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,919
um it's now officially available into

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,199
the

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,319
the public data repo from open bmc uh we

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
do have also

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,120
introduced some support for the dl360

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,960
within the linux boot

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,479
repo we still have a lot of work ahead

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,919
but um i'm pretty happy about the shift

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,759
that we are currently operating

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,880
regarding this

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,319
we are still facing as hpe

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,160
some challenging around the support

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,720
of pci express devices so as you may be

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,280
aware

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
that there is firmware everywhere now

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
and

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,919
most of the communities are focused

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,160
around the bmc

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,960
and the system bios but what about

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
the the nick drivers and the league

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
firmwares

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
or the storage controllers and all these

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,520
kind of devices which are running uh

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
proprietary firmware which are getting

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,479
more and more complex

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,160
and i understand it in in some cases or

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,240
not yeah they are pretty buggy so

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
and um it's pretty tough just to try to

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
fix them and um

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,680
and we still need to rely on our

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
suppliers just to be able to fix that

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
okay wow quite quite a lot of news quite

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
a lot of

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
details and um so i understand you're

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,080
also working

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
a lot from the industry side and uh yeah

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
before i come

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,199
to ron then i would like to

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
ask daniel so daniel um we see like a

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,240
lot of

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,800
progress has been going on on the

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,919
industry side but you're also

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,560
more on the like let's say um

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,319
the developer side engaging with like

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
different people also in the community a

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,080
lot

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:47,120
and so what is your impression

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
yes i've i would say uh

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,199
quite diverse view on things so um

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
i'm not just involved in communities but

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,240
i'm also tracking lots of different

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,400
communities

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,080
and one of them is at large researchers

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,960
so you might have seen during the last

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
years now uh in the news there was every

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,360
now and then

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,680
something like data breaches

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,639
there was progress in attacking hardware

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,520
on

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
different layers and different ways

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,039
right so

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
basically when people discovered hey uh

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,440
your ram that's uh

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,639
clocked at 2.4 gigahertz no that's also

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
true for wi-fi

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
so can we do something to transmit data

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,959
over that

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,880
that's one thing i'm looking at and on

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,000
the other hand

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,680
we have such a huge market especially

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,959
for consumers

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,519
which is a very heterogeneous market so

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,680
that's both very very hard for vendors

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
right they would need to support lots of

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,200
different devices

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,560
which is really kind of the toughest job

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
you can do

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
and on the other hand for consumers it's

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
very very hard to navigate through that

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
market and you know

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,399
understand what you can buy so if you

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,800
want to have a contemporary computer

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
and you want to assemble it yourself

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,640
just

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,080
finding parts that match together

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,839
is already quite hard and then still

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
comes the software side right and that

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
starts with the firmware and you want to

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,880
install an operating system

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,360
to your likings and yeah sometimes

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,959
uh you might run into surprises like

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
missing drivers or

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,480
maybe you cannot boot at all because the

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
hardware and firmware is actually locked

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
down in

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,320
some ways um so yeah i've been diving

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
through this

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,160
uh and trying to find devices that we

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,839
can actually

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,640
repurpose or you know just use as

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
developer

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
development platforms for people who are

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
not working

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
in one of these large companies

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
providing us with the devices

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,760
so that we can become a bit more

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,959
independent and i'm seeing that

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,920
in some very specialized communities as

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,720
well

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,880
there is for example one which is

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,920
especially looking at cameras the

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,120
so-called ip cameras which are attached

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,399
to networks

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,320
uh very often the internet already

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,320
and there are actually just a very few

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,720
vendors behind them

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,640
but some people figured out what

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,279
platforms they are running on

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,399
and they're now building open firmware

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,279
for it

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,120
and that's the open ipc project if

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,600
you've heard about that one

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,160
which i find very very interesting and

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
just by

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,360
coincidence i actually discovered that

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,160
because

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,320
i you know just found some cheap cameras

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,640
i wanted to look into them

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,399
so i took a little tool called you root

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
put it onto them

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,640
and run it successfully and i thought

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
well other people might have tried that

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,440
as well

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,519
and it turns out there were lots and i

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,480
assume that's also true for many many

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,839
other devices that you can find nowadays

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,839
already have even attached to your body

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
maybe

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,959
thank you and yeah

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,399
um that was like a perspective i think

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,600
from the community side

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,279
and ron you are based in this so-called

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,480
silicon valley as well and so uh

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,120
yeah how um have you seen like changes

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,120
in

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,880
in the last few months and um yeah i

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
want to come back a bit

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,079
to what bunny said already maybe you

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
already

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,360
have a comment that we see some changes

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,440
with

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
big actors getting in so i think we

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,160
could like for example

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,200
mention that um yeah there's

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,560
some support for example by google for

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
um

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,079
like developers who are interested to

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,480
create chips

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,760
for example and do you have an opinion

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
on on on that

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,320
and how are things developing recently

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
from your point of view

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
so i've been i've been thinking as i've

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
been listening these

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,320
two to the other three panelists because

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,040
i learned some things too

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,160
um so there are two

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
trends i can see where people are trying

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
to

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,160
open up firmware to the extent possible

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,880
on systems like x86 and so

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,720
what we've done at google we we've taken

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
linux food which means linux in your

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,079
firmware and

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
we use you root which daniel mentioned

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,200
which is go

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,680
you know programs written in go that

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,519
kind of replace standard unix commands

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
and embedded linux food and european

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,200
firmware

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
and that is that is essentially

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
integrated into uefi which is the

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,920
proprietary

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,720
for bios we can't get rid of yet and

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,800
google has deployed that at scale in our

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
data centers and i'm not allowed to say

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,800
what at scale

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,760
means but people have a rough idea how

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,639
many computers

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,519
google has and should be able to maybe

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
guess what

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,920
you know that turns into into the number

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,160
of computers in our data centers

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,079
that today now run linux boot and you

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,120
root and that's worked out really really

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,120
well so what we're doing is part of that

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,240
project which originally we called nerf

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,560
and now i forget what we call it um we

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,160
are peeling away

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,720
all as much as we can of uefi we're bit

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,680
by bit

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,600
just pulling it out of there and

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,519
replacing its function with the linux

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
kernel and go programs

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,120
and my goal is to drive that as close to

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,120
zero uefi as i can

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,760
that's kind of tough and we know that

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
on many systems let's just say those

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
well from intel and amd let's just say

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,000
that's going to be a long long thing and

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,639
i don't ever even expect to get there

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,760
context here 20 years ago you could have

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,040
a full

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,279
gpl software i mean firmware stack on an

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,279
x86 from amd or intel

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,959
and you can no longer do that today so

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,000
there's context

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:05,519
um so there's another effort called

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,760
orboot and that's firmware and rust

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,519
and we have a number of targets daniel

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
is actually involved in these the first

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,440
target is in amd rome

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,199
and on amd rome because the memory

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,399
turn-on is done in a little arm

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,880
processor

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,000
you can imagine having the x86 running

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,959
completely

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,920
again gpl firmware written in rust now

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,240
so

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,920
you know we're removing now toward rust

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
because of all the good arguments for

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
rust

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
and we're trying to get a hundred

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,680
percent cheap health code on the

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,839
at least the x86 cpu longer term

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,000
i don't think the x86 will ever again be

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,920
as open as it was 20 years ago it's just

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
i don't think that's going to happen

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
and so people who really want a

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
completely

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,040
[Music]

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,440
you know free and open source software

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,720
stack need to look at things like the

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,519
wrist five

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,639
and possibly the arm i but i i think the

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
arm

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
possibly could be more problematical

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,360
because a lot of the people who

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,320
create arm socs and sell them come with

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
blobs

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
and there's there's no way around that

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
and my belief is if you really want to

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
trust the system you're on

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,800
you're going to want that to be you know

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,160
risk 5 isn't open source by the way risk

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,920
5 is unlicensed

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
so you have to take an extra step with

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
the first 5

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,440
and go to a company that offers it in

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,440
open source if you really want that

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,279
so if you want to complete open source

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,079
stack all the way from the transistors

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,680
up like bunny

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,079
has been pushing which i think is

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,480
fantastic it's got a half of your wrist

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,759
five

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,160
because it doesn't come with legal

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,399
encumbrance and then it ought to be

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,199
i think a g pill thing written in rust

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,360
because

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,480
why would you write in c in the third

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,759
millennium anyway

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
right you're crazy if you're still

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,160
writing in c in my opinion

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,000
and then we go up from there so that's

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,199
that's kind of my picture of

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,279
of where we should be going and you know

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,480
but we have to bow to the realities of

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,959
the world

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,120
which are that we've all got a gazillion

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,480
x86 systems and that's going to kind of

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
change for a long time

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,759
and those systems are never going to be

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
open again the way they were 20 years

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
ago

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
so you have to accommodate yourself the

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,320
binary blobs

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,440
in that world so it's kind of a nuanced

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,279
picture right

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
we're moving away we'd like to move away

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,959
from systems that require binary blogs

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
we'd like to move away from c

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,639
we'd like to move toward not only

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,399
unlicensed architectures or

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
architectures free of that kind of

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,000
licensing we'd like to be on open source

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
processors so that's the work of you

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,279
know a couple of years coming up but

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,040
we can kind of see all the pieces

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,360
that we need to implement to make that

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
happen

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,519
um thank you very much ron and uh and

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,920
you are raising uh a lot of questions

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
and i

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,920
i always like i also have this tendency

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
to uh to often say we

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,120
and then like people always say who are

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
you talking about yeah

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
and i say yeah well because every time i

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,720
talk about is another we

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
sometimes it's from project perspective

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,120
sometimes it's with other team

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,920
because actually it's very truthful that

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,440
we are not

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,520
operating like in a small like console

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,679
where we just like work on our with our

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,559
own right like we always

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,559
em embedded in teams in projects in

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,520
societies in our company

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,199
so um i i find both truthful and i don't

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,199
know some people

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,480
criticize it but like um i think it's

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,839
it's uh it's good

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,880
but sometimes need to be defined who am

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,880
i talking or where

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,440
or from what perspective am i talking

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
currently and um i see

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,720
bunny is smiling already i want to go in

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
a moment to bunny

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,720
too because like i i saw like he's

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,200
morning and smiling and

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:45,120
yeah already he's speaking with his face

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,120
and this okay this is what i love about

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,400
like this interaction and video at least

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,280
what we have

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
but um i so i see like a number of

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,120
questions

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,240
and um like their technical questions

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,520
and their questions in regard uh to

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,840
um society and in my view like

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,840
and we have big companies they're

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,160
putting pouring in a lot of money

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,760
um but there are a lot of questions

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,840
involved the questions that we also have

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,799
with open source free software

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,640
today um where we have companies

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,919
dominating some parts of this

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,720
ecosystem um and we have the question

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,280
of um like one company that hasn't been

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,320
named

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,440
yet here but when you talk about arm you

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,720
we also of course um think of google

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,679
and of apple now right so apple uh

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,240
brought out this chip m1 and in this

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,039
panel

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,039
everyone said oh yeah we're going in the

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,240
right direction things are opening up

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,640
gpl free and open programming language

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,840
and

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,640
and so on and before i want to go back

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,520
before i go back to bunny um ron is

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,360
there any

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,840
comment that you would like to to make

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,840
in regards to apple

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
now

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,520
okay so i think that's also a comment

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
and so then then bunny what do you think

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
so far

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,880
from listening to this panel and

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,919
listening to ron listening to jean-marie

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,919
and daniel um do you have any

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,039
anything to share me i mean um

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,120
so you know when i made my my

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,720
initial statement it said that there are

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,400
actors that have incentives to keep

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,799
things closed despite things

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,679
um moving in the right direction i think

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,840
you know

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,200
i'll say i think apple's one of the

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,880
people who

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,559
like to keep things close they want to

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
keep people in their ecosystem

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
they want you to go to the genius bar

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
they want you to buy things for the app

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
store

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
they want to make a nickel every time

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,240
you play a nickel every time you work

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,919
um you know that's kind of that's their

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
business model how do you become uh

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,720
you know one of the most valuable

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
companies on earth and keep your

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,919
position when you've kind of run out of

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
ground to keep running on

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
you got to create a profit line

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,679
somewhere right so there's there are

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,200
incentives that run against

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,720
sort of the co you know create a

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
competitive landscape

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,400
and open landscape right i mean i think

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
openness

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
is about choice but it's also about

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,919
competition

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,039
and uh and there's a certain

00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,919
non-profitability in that i think you

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,799
know from not having a monopoly position

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
um so you know all that being said that

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,840
you know apple's just behaving as you

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,159
expected what is a public company

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,919
right that's run by what formerly the

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,120
ceo of the company right now

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,440
now you know you know there an

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,520
operations driven organization

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,799
trying to try to do what they what they

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,840
all do right

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,640
um i i think that i have a friend who's

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,919
working you know

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,600
on on uh porting linux to the

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,799
to the uh apple uh the asahi linux

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,720
project i think it's pretty interesting

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,919
to watch it coming along and and

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,280
you know sort of read his exploits and

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,240
the crazy sort of like

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,679
wtf moments he has like realizing that

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
the kinds of things that they did in

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,400
their

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,120
boot process and their you know in their

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
in their

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,720
sock and whatnot i mean it's you know

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,720
but i mean the the other thing is it's

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,480
like

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,159
i feel i feel like there's also a bit of

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,919
uh you know if you know

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,600
i have a thesis that when you when you

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,640
sort of peel back you know the number of

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,159
reasons why things

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,799
stay closed um it's not just also

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,360
um sort of the oh big corporate profit

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
driven thing

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,559
there's also just a lot of embarrassing

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,840
mistakes inside hardware

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,799
and it's really hard to as

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,640
a organization that has to support

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,080
customers and have a reputation for

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,559
quality hardware it's hard to admit they

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,120
have erotim in your hardware right if

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,280
you

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,960
actually see the list of iran that come

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
on like really well documented ships you

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
know if you printed it it's a sheath of

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,159
documentation this thick like thousands

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
and thousands of tiny bugs

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,840
things you're working around like a chip

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,600
isn't so much to

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,039
you know designed from spec it's so you

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
get a chip backing to discover what the

00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,919
spec is after validation

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
you're like okay how fast is the nick

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,960
run i don't know let's benchmark it okay

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,320
that's that's the number put in the

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
marketing thing right you know we

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
we wanted 2x that performance but we

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,559
actually shipped that right and that's

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,600
just how it is because you're not going

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,520
to

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,520
spend two million dollars on a mass set

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,799
to fix a tiny bug in an arbitration

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
issue somewhere deep in the

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,240
exe bus or something like this it's just

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,200
not going to happen so

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
so so there's also a bit of i guess

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
you've

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,720
engineering hubris you know around sort

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,559
of not wanting to admit

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
that we have mistakes and that's i think

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,640
that almost falls a little bit on the

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
community

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
expectations we place on ourselves and

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,400
our inability to sort of admit that we

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
have problems

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
but you know we're getting better about

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,280
i think as people get more educated

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,799
about the reality of hardware and the

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
reality of these situations people you

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,600
know customers are becoming a little

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
more sophisticated they want to sort of

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,559
see that

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
texture that granularity that sort of

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,440
all those interesting things are coming

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
along so that's that's the hopeful side

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,159
i would say

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,760
of of of things going the right

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,880
direction but like part of the reason

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,200
we're never going to see

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,280
um like ufi and that sort of stuff ever

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,640
go away is just just so many

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,720
you know the vendors don't want to

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
publish why they have that

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,080
that little sort of bit of firmware is

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,360
because actually if they didn't publish

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,120
you know have it the chip would burn

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,480
itself out in three seconds because of a

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,320
problem in the pll somewhere right this

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
is this is too embarrassing

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,280
to you know that the stock value of

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
several companies would plummet

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,559
immediately if they knew that

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,760
you know if you just did the right bits

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,120
on boot or something like that you could

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,320
melt down a half a billion dollars with

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,280
the servers or something like that it's

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,159
just not something

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,159
they want people to know

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,640
um wow that is quite a scary

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
idea that you are putting out here and

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,240
i'm

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,679
yeah um i wonder like

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,840
how much people are really getting into

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,919
this topic that um actually

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
um the possibility of hacking these

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,640
things is

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,919
is growing or not um i don't know

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,279
so you're mentioning expectations and

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,640
community so

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,080
um a lot of people say like that the the

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
open hardware community is

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,159
still relatively small and of course

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,000
also if you compare it to the

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,080
um like software community of people who

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,720
really focus on the software layer

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,200
and so let's talk about the open

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,679
hardware and open firmware community

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,760
and who would you count into this what's

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,679
your idea about this community

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,520
is it growing is it like a specific set

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,720
of people could you describe it a little

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,400
bit bunny

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,640
oh me okay back to me again you

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,159
mentioned it

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,559
i mean i i i i pers i mean i don't know

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,559
i don't

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,720
i don't feel i don't feel any uh

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
any how do you say uh entitlement to be

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,640
able to describe the community it's a

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,159
big tent

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,000
right whoever wants to come in you know

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,279
come with a soldering iron a screwdriver

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
an open mind and now you're part of the

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,440
community

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,559
and if you if you want to take your

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,320
stuff and close it you're not part of

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,600
the community anymore right

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,279
um and you know so long so long as i can

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
discover your stuff and i can fork it

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,279
and i can use it then

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
i'm i'm i'm a very like i guess

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,320
traditional

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,760
open source idealist in that in that

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,440
sense right

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,039
um i think realistically speaking though

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,640
people have to have day jobs and they

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,760
have motivations and stuff so

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,480
generally we we get more community as

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,000
more commercial interest starts to

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
sponsor people

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,559
to make it their day job to be in the

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,840
community there's very few people who

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,840
are lucky enough to just as a matter of

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,200
their choice without any constraint just

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
do what they want to do that's pretty

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,400
rare

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,600
um from from a community standpoint um

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,480
and so and so

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,760
we have a lot of conflict you know with

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,760
i know everyone's like

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,440
github's on microsoft oh my god like

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
it's terrible you know microsoft is

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
taking over

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
open source and then you know google's

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,279
doing this open titan thing oh my god

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
can we trust that they're getting into

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,120
like

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,799
you know you know open secure enclaves

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,919
and stuff i mean

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,880
you know it's a it's a it's a mixed bag

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
right you

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
you need finances to make things happen

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,360
you need resources to do it

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,840
and nothing comes for free so there's a

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,000
bit of like we have to

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,440
as a community the people you know this

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,320
is this is where you end up with

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,000
you know people you talk about people

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,600
who are more radicalized than others

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
people who push harder for one thing or

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
the other

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,919
right it's you know you have to have

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,240
people who set an aggressive set of goal

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,840
posts around the idealism type of thing

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,039
and and hold to it and remind us where

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,919
we come from so we don't lose our

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,520
bearings

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,960
but then you also need to you know throw

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
gasoline on the fire and get things

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
moving

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,799
and so there's constant tension that

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
always happens in in any of our

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,279
communities

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,039
on on this front it's between like you

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,640
know progress and scale and

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,640
motivations and these types of things

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,240
and i tend to find it's

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,240
you know as long as we keep the pretty

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,760
big tent and we have open conversations

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
like this about it and we're frank about

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,679
when we

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,919
sort of play the game we know what we're

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,080
playing um i think we'll

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
sort of keep moving through it i wanted

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,000
i wanted to

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
surprise you a little about this too

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,320
um about everyone here if you really

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,400
want to talk about a company that's in

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,039
the open source firmware game

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,120
in a big way and in the right way you

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,200
want to look at ibm

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,200
and that should surprise people but if

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,799
you look at the power nine

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,799
all the source code you need to build

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,000
their firmware has been out there for

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,240
years and it actually includes linux

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,919
and actually i've ported linux in europe

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,360
to the power nine

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,039
and the degree the the amount of

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,960
openness of that power 10

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,360
predates in a lot of ways the openness

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,880
of the risk fight and

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,919
i think they don't get the credit they

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
deserve

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,960
for for what they've accomplished there

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
because it's actually

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,960
as funny points out this is a really big

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
deal you're not opening up your firmware

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,240
are you opening up all your hardware

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,200
bugs to people when you release this

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,480
stuff

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,440
and you know um some very brilliant

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
people at ibm

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,760
i know one you know oh gee i just forgot

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,799
her last name elaine

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,799
someone remember her last name for me um

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,720
yeah palmer she is just utterly

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,120
fantastic just look her up

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,480
she's worked very hard on how you do the

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,799
security side

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,240
of the system where all the firmware is

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,279
open source

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,200
and a lot of lessons and and

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,520
i'm kind of sorry that you know let's be

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,720
blunt it's hard to afford a power

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,399
nine system right you're probably going

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,799
to spend 100 times

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,480
you know as to get a working power 9

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,960
system as you would to get a risk five

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,240
board

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,840
you know cheap so um that i kind of

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,520
regret that because

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,960
ibm has done the right thing here from

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,799
my point of view so

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,279
that tent should include ibm believe it

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,039
or not and and

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,440
and open titan should be in that tent

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,279
actually i actually

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,600
disclaimer i'm on the board of

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,360
lowrisk.org and i've i've kind of had an

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,360
involvement in open titan

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,679
but i know the people and yep they work

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,279
for let's just be blunt people consider

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,480
google a giant heartless international

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,240
appropriation

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
i don't know if that's fair or not but

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,880
uh the people i know doing up in titan

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,360
are working

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,480
very very hard to do the right thing

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,039
yeah and

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,360
you know so so you gotta you kind of

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,960
gotta look a little bit beyond

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,880
you know obviously you have to be a

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,679
little bit you can't just trust but you

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
can trust and

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,919
not trust and verify but you have to

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,760
look a little bit beyond just the

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,279
surface appearance oh that person's at

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,559
google or an open titan

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,880
i don't know if i can trust it up in

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,919
titan you know that's okay maybe maybe

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,799
not but

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,640
the rtl is on github go to get nothing

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
get all the rtl for open titan see if

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
you trust right anyway i interrupted

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,520
money

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
i'll stop no no no no no that was great

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,399
i mean i actually like i

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,320
i know a lot of guys in the open titan

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,679
project too and i i go your your

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,679
sentiment i think they're great and

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,039
and this despite sort of the reputation

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,200
that big companies have

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,880
i didn't mean to sort of imply i was

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
disparaging the project i'm just saying

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
that

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,120
generally there's a community sentiment

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,919
of distrusting these things

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,520
yes and yeah and and you know but that

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,120
it doesn't mean that it's all bad or all

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,240
good we have to we have to sort of get

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,919
into the nuance

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,520
instead of just putting labels on things

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,480
and binning them

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,679
um but i i one one thing i wanted to add

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,039
you said that you know power nines are

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,039
expensive and said

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,480
you know unfortunately you know there's

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,360
a there's an observation i generally

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,039
have is that

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,880
projects that don't subsidize

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,399
the cost of making something open

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,240
because open open is

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:21,520
is uh it's actually there's sort of a

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,720
anyone who's ever worked on okay let me

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,600
let me reset the story here so so people

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,640
have often asked me like why is it that

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
i can't get

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,200
documentation for this leading mobile

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
phone soc

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,360
right like you know but i can get

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,720
documentation for the imx6 or something

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,120
like this from freescale this really

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,120
well documented open source chip right

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,159
it turned it turns out that if you you

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,760
know i had a conversation with the

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,039
freescale engineer about they said

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,120
it cost them by far more to develop the

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,720
open software stack and document it than

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,360
it does to make the chip

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,519
which is why their chips are always like

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,080
a generation behind and a process too

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,720
old but everything's in the main line of

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,399
linux

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,000
right the thing that actually gates that

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,120
chip is is that

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
is that and their chips are more

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,000
expensive and all this sort of stuff

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,840
it's because

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,120
they didn't externalize the cost of a

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,000
resource it's actually built

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,760
into that hardware and what what what

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,159
you find is that a lot of times

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,360
a lot of these cheaper platforms right

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
there they're either

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
subsidized by other things and so you

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,880
they can't be open or

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,399
what what actually is more likely that

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,000
happens on a lot of these chips

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,519
is a vendor will say okay i've got this

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
leading mobile phone sock

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,559
they'll put the spec sheet out but it's

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,840
also nda in itself because they don't

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,880
want to admit they haven't tested all

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,000
the features yet

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,919
and then they have then they have a

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,039
million unit order from somebody start

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,799
they start flashing out they figure out

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,320
what actually works and then finally

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,919
they only write the drivers for the

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,279
things that actually end up being used

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,720
in the final phone

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,159
so you'll actually find on the chip a

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,640
whole bunch of dark silicon for things

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,320
that didn't

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,000
actually make it into the final product

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,840
they didn't have to burn engineer time

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,559
to support a real-time clock in this

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,480
mode that

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,840
no one ever bothered using that's too

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,360
expensive to just write these

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,960
these features to be future complete

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,080
according to documentation

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,480
right so so so what you find is that on

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,240
these

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,159
the the fastest way to get a product out

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,480
is actually to build the hardware

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,840
make sure it doesn't catch fire throw it

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,080
at someone who develops

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,519
a product that can ship a million units

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,440
of it and it gets just

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,360
enough of the features working qualified

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,080
for that specific product and leave the

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,679
rest

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,440
turned off right just don't even turn i

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,519
don't even admit that you have it

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,799
at the end of the day and that's a very

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,080
in because the problem if you want to

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,600
open source that thing all of a sudden

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,799
some random guy

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,240
you know somewhere out in the middle of

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,679
the you know is going to post in the

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,360
form like why is it that when i turn on

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,159
the real-time clock the system catches

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,320
fire

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,159
right and and then and then it's a big

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,519
it's a big problem all of a sudden right

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,399
you should even know that this thing

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,039
even exists

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,480
right so you know that's and then but

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,480
you know when you say the power 9

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,080
or power 8 power 9 is expensive it's

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,919
because i think in part because you know

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,760
ibm is

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,679
they're making you pay in the cost of

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
the hardware for all that openness and

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,480
all that documentation that's actually

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
the price of an engineer

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,919
it built into the into the cost of a

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,679
chip versus like sort of this

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,279
ford subsidized uh system

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,799
and that's a really good point too

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,519
because we've hit this in the coordinate

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,279
project

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,360
since inception which is um

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,559
somebody says man i really care about it

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,720
free and open source software

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,640
i really really really want corbin on my

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,799
machine oh and by the way i don't want

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,919
to pay any penalty at cost performance

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,480
weight power consumption battery life

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,480
i so i want the high-end features that i

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,039
associate with the latest bleeding edge

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,760
laptop

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,279
oh and by the way i want four yeah well

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
and anytime you kind of come back and

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,320
say

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,360
you cannot have those things at the same

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,600
time

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,120
the they say okay well the one thing i'm

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,760
willing to throw away

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,399
is free and open source software yeah

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,519
yeah

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,000
every time yeah that's true it's kind of

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
it's kind of makes me sad but uh look i

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
do it too

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,720
this i'm you're gonna all kill me but

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
i'm sitting and talking to a mac right

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,640
now

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,840
so there we are yeah well i don't think

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,760
we have many options

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,519
aside i mean the other thing is that i'm

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,270
using like a lenovo or something like is

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,119
that yeah would that have made it better

00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:14,000
[Laughter]

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,480
okay so i thought you're using a novena

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,520
laptop

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,200
um okay so yeah sure yeah and then i

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,639
can't keep up with this video

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,760
it would collapse okay so and

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,320
um i i want to think about the point

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,280
that

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,839
like um i i'm afraid people get a bit

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,879
the

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,240
wrong idea that bunny acted like a

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,280
little bit in the way that people really

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,399
have to look for

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,200
economic opportunities and find a way

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,040
where whereas i think the one person in

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
the world who knows how to

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,240
make business around open hardware is

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,320
funny and we will

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,280
hear later more about this in your

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,159
keynote about precursor which was a very

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,720
successful crowdfunding campaign and but

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,079
like

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,800
in regards to the community aspect

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,200
um daniel and what would you like to add

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,079
here

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,560
so we hear like different um angles and

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,480
you know

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,839
generally i think everyone is happy that

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,960
things are opening up

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:18,240
um but what is your perspective on

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:25,119
yeah on the engagement with companies

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,119
well that's also a bit of a mixed bag so

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,640
you can't even talk about a company at

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,760
large even

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,640
so you know there are usually

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,240
lots of lots of different departments in

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,119
a single company

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,160
and that's also true for companies who

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,200
sell

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,040
any sort of technical products

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,760
let's say hp for example right they

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,920
sell servers they still they sell their

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,400
business laptops they sell the

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,560
ordinary laptops for regular people of

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,480
which you will find hundreds

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,720
uh just somewhere i don't know at

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,560
walmart or wherever you go

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,960
um they also have printers

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,320
right it's it's a huge amount of

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,480
different things

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,880
and it's always a bit of um

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,760
i would say uh first of all a bit of a

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,480
matter of luck

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,119
if you just approach a company and you

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,599
ask them for some information

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,440
you might just get it right away for

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,960
example what ron was mentioning the

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,880
orboot project

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,160
um where we have a target currently

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,240
which we are focusing a bit on um

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,920
we were very very lucky in the choice

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,320
that we made

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,440
and we found a chip on on the board that

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,040
we picked for development

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,480
for which we couldn't find open

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,320
documentation

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,520
but it turned out that the company was

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
very approachable

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,000
who made that ship and they said yeah

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,240
sure here you can have that data sheet

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,520
and well we asked again to be sure can

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,680
we also publish that so

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,920
you know it's an open project and so on

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,839
yes of course go ahead

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,400
that happens at the same time there are

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,960
also

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,599
others where you might write an email

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,720
you

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,480
get a response like a week later that

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,920
might be along the lines of

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,960
yeah we would support like custom

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,160
development if you want to

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,040
produce or buy lots of devices or

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,560
chips or whatever and we're talking

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,119
about numbers that

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,160
ordinary people you know cannot

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,200
calculate

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,680
in their regular thinking right

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,800
so it's like your grocery list it's more

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,480
like um

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,720
you know if you have been in a very

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,760
large company in a somewhat higher

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,440
position

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
that's the numbers we're talking about

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,320
here um

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,599
and if you know we as a community of

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,839
regular people

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,520
so that's the thing there are different

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,320
sorts of communities

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,079
mostly when we talk about uh communities

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,920
in the open

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,400
the impression is that we are talking

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,359
about you know the no ones that are

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,000
just walking around everywhere right so

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,160
like you

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,520
or me you know we just want to buy a

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,640
laptop and we would like to have

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,760
something which

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,440
performs well enough um well it turns

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,119
out that actually nowadays you can take

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,960
a laptop from 10 years ago

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,520
you can still use big blue button from

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,079
it i'm doing that right now this here is

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,000
a

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,960
lenovo x230 um old enough but it still

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,760
works fine

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,040
but there are also communities of people

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,760
who would like to collaborate a bit more

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,839
which are actually employees at some of

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,400
those larger companies

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,640
and that's especially true for uh people

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,599
who are working for example on the linux

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,520
kernel

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,599
so there are many people who are

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,680
contributing to that kernel

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,560
um but you know they are also their own

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,079
community

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,960
and they also have their own conferences

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,480
and so on

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,720
where they meet together um and that's

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,560
kind of an interesting mixture so on the

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,440
one hand side you have vendors who would

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,400
actually

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,480
prefer to keep things closed a bit but

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,200
they need to also

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,960
support the market so you know they make

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,000
blobs and header files

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,839
um you know like uh there is this linux

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,440
firmware repository where you know you

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,880
find a bunch of blobs and lots of

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,920
headers for it

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,240
um but there are also some which are you

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,040
know

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,760
just as open and willing to collaborate

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,079
and

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,119
then again what bunny was just saying um

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,880
there is also this weird spot where

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,240
you run into all of these hardware

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
issues and

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,160
guess where you will find documentation

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,160
on those issues

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,400
in a larger and well-known kernel of

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,560
course so if you just look through the

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,440
linux kernel source code

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,119
you will find thousands of issues

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,839
documented in there

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,240
uh where there is code which you would

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,240
never

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,240
assume to find there because you would

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,920
say no no this must be wrong but the

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,680
documentation then actually says

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,680
well this is a workaround for that and

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,680
that and so on and you know if things

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,400
twist around in the right way

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,040
uh it works otherwise you know it might

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,040
catch fire

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,400
yeah thank you uh daniel

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,280
and i want to bring this to uh

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,520
jean-marie so we have this topic of

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,880
community of openness and

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,280
and yeah companies that have their

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,720
own commercial interest and you are

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,920
working for hpe

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,839
and on your side um you shipped

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,359
your first systems with open source

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,119
firmware recently

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,040
they are available to private customers

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,520
who are making a request

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,079
and you have extended your ci to

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,040
integrate

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,359
uh remote api as to ease the validation

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,720
of

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,760
end users built on hpe pro

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,400
lion and a big topic for you is that you

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,520
are willing

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,920
to expand security features so do you

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,160
see

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,119
um that security features make a

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,359
difference and

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,800
do you think that open source firmware

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,079
and open hardware

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,040
will really make a difference for

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,079
customers because of security features

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,200
um or what are your ideas

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,920
okay i think the complexity of a company

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,200
like hpe is that we are selling systems

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,359
on a worldwide basis and we see a split

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,480
uh regarding the customer demand between

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,119
north america

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,760
and europe for example so in north

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,000
america

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,119
people do not want to take care of their

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,520
security

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,280
so they are trusting their suppliers and

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,040
they want their suppliers to be liable

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,839
for the security

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,440
if you go to europe um so that's a

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,160
totally different story they do not

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,839
trust

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,680
their suppliers and they want to take

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,680
care about their security

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,839
and and they are building up a security

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,200
stack through

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,400
transparency so which means that when

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,359
you work at hpe

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,560
so you are you are designing a systems

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,760
that you try to ship

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,680
worldwide with two different with

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
totally different target and that that

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,240
is the challenge that we are facing

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,720
currently

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,280
um open source firmware currently fit

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,119
better

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,520
probably in europe than in north america

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,319
because people can have a look to the to

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,720
the code

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,400
can adapt it and and there is far much

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,839
more transparency

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,000
by releasing the the source code um

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,040
i am i am optimistic for the future of

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,079
open hardware

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,240
um for many different reasons

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,400
the main reason why people might be

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,240
thinking it is slow uh regarding the

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,240
adoption and the shift

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,960
from companies like dec hpe is um

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,280
the first one that i just did explain

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,240
the market is not the same everywhere

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,520
so it makes more difficult to take the

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,599
right decision

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,839
and then we have to keep to keep in mind

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,520
that companies like hpe have a

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,839
legacy so our engineering team

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
designed proprietary firmware for the

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,119
past 20 years

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,760
so you cannot shift all of these people

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,160
in a day so this is like a big boat so

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,000
when you

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,640
when you say we have to turn left so

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,960
it's not going to happen super fast

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,880
so this is not a speed boat this is like

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,160
a big long-haul

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,040
turn and um and we are working on this

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,000
uh but from what i have seen during the

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,720
past year

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,160
um a crazy amount of people inside the

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,000
company were

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,520
becoming more and more interested about

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,200
what's going on into the open source

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,599
firmware communities

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,480
and um as i said we started to grant

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,560
code

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,640
um it could looks like something super

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,240
basic but within a company like hpe

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,800
it does require a circuit the amount of

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,960
process so we we need to get approval

00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,240
from many different different

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,440
business units or ip attorneys or all

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,200
this kind of stuff that

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,599
people do not imagine when they are

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,040
working in 200 pencils community

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,800
which are happening into a big

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,240
corporation like hp

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,200
but all of that has happened during 2020

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,599
so which makes me optimistic for 2021

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,640
2022 and 2023

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:24,079
so we we are going to move forward

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,560
um um i'm believing that the market is

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,480
going

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,400
it's going to stay split between north

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,560
america and europe

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,720
um i'm always surprised about that

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,240
because i'm living in north america

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,160
and i am a european citizen so this um

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,440
this is really weird for me just to have

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,119
a look at how

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,720
north american companies react to

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,160
consortium where compared to what's

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,319
going on in europe

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,480
but uh this is also super interesting

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,079
because i'm discussing on a daily basis

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,480
with engineers which are american

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,480
people and i'm trying and trying to

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,440
explain them if we do not do that

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,119
that we are going to struggle um in this

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,200
european market and this is

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,480
still super important for a company like

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,480
hpe because

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,960
we are doing 40 percent of our revenue

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,240
in europe and and that is critical just

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,720
to be successful

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,720
to follow what our customer demand ears

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,240
and uh so uh jean-marie i have a

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,760
question to you because there wasn't

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,280
very interesting talk of uh

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,960
lime proven um at uh foster recently

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,440
and uh uh lime is also from um

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,160
um like you're talking about hp right

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,280
like so

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,000
um here's this perspective where until

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,119
today or

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
like today um all computers have used

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,040
hard disks and at least two storage

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,880
levels

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,160
and and um yeah the future might look

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,760
different he says the future might look

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,800
more like the past again um where um

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,599
yeah this kind of difference um it

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,800
could become obsolete in this kind of

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,680
separation

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,200
and a computer's permanent storage it

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,640
could be all right there in the

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,200
processor's memory map

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,160
and um he says there could be that there

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,119
is no need

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,400
for this controllers or file systems it

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,000
could all just be

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,920
ram and so if we talk about the future

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,839
and it could be imagine also like a

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,880
future where um the software and

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,319
hardware stack

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,570
could look different uh what's your idea

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,359
oh uh

00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:31,280
[Music]

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:34,079
that's uh it's not that easy to answer

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,839
to that questions because um

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,280
i know the past we are trying to follow

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,640
but i don't know what i can disclose

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,720
biblically

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,560
so that's the that's the complexity of

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,599
that questions

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,680
what i think is short term the future is

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,560
going to be more modular

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,400
and we are we are currently focused at

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,960
just trying to

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,359
break down the servers just to offer

00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,800
more opportunities for innovation

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,440
around how a server works um that is

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,640
true

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,720
that there may be needs for

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,319
um revisiting the way the storage of

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,200
system works

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,079
and that's also why i'm pushing

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,760
extremely hard

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,599
at the pci express card vendor or just

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,200
to carefully review what they are doing

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,880
because they are adding a ton of

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,160
complexity into their

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,920
um uh asics and firmware and

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,680
i don't think this is the right path to

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,119
follow so

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,920
and uh and there are also our suppliers

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,599
and um and they probably have to listen

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,200
a little bit more to

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:43,119
their customers and and to

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,559
what we might be expecting from them

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,480
just to enhance

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:51,200
their product so my believing is

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,880
when the system is becoming too complex

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,839
it's probably not the right path to

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,720
follow

00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,160
or at least just to stay independent

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,200
from what's going on and being shown

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,200
that you have a b plan

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,760
yeah i'm always happy when people tell

00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:09,200
me uh

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,079
uh approaching difficult questions so

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,440
this means we come back to this later

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,880
definitely in detail

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,400
and i would like to ask ron because

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,400
ron you work on harvey os um

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,760
you have all this background with the

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,000
core boot and orboot

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,119
and what's your take on this i don't

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,160
know if you have

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:34,640
heard about this talk so um that

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:38,319
basically the yeah pass could be also uh

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:41,599
the future i i remember years ago

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:44,240
bos for example they had a huge kind of

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,680
they had a very good marketing yeah and

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,720
everyone was so excited

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,359
but it never took took off and

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,079
what do you see as the technology stack

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,079
of the future

00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,240
i you know i i i don't think i'm

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,720
smart enough to have the faintest idea

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,720
but the the one thing i have been

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,960
noticing

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,040
it takes me out nine months the last

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,720
time i put a passionate linux kernel

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,079
for that patch to come out the other end

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,520
of the of the process

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,319
of managing a patch and i i hope there's

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,359
a feeling in the community that maybe

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,680
um unending growth of the linux kernel

00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,200
is not really the right future and it's

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,640
time to start

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,319
rethinking the architecture such that

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,599
when i make a two-line change to

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,079
something that manages

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,520
memory technology device driver it

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,119
doesn't take nine months

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,960
for that to get through whatever

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,760
processes exist and

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,160
that we aren't on the right track when

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,800
our

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,240
our path is to basically suck every new

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,160
bit of functionality into

00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,880
the linux kernel itself and

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,319
so there is i wish it were two weeks

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,640
from now there's going to be some pretty

00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,520
neat news about plan nine in about two

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,880
weeks

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,000
at last um let's just say becoming free

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,880
of the restraints

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,640
now that's an obsolete piece of code as

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,480
kernels go at c

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,800
but it's a good lesson maybe in how you

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,040
can structure things so that

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,559
they aren't so massive and monolithic

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,000
and yet still might

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,400
have power um i actually think if we

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,920
look at

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,079
open source processors uh you know you

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,839
kind of think of okay that news about

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,200
about a decade and a half in the

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,200
performance

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,400
and maybe i want to look at an operating

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,160
system that doesn't quite

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,720
consume so many resources as it uses the

00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,640
machine

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:42,079
so um i feel like

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,160
i like the move and the work going on in

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,240
open source processors and i think now

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,000
we need to think about

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,760
what how would the world look different

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,200
yeah if um

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,119
we have so much memory in this

00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,960
persistent memory how do we rethink

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,839
doing file systems i don't i don't think

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,680
though that

00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,440
you can just say well we don't have file

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,440
systems anymore because we have this

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,599
persistent memory that lasts forever

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
you still need some sort of structure

00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,280
you still need a way to say

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,880
you know i have a view of the memory but

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,800
it's not the view of the memory you have

00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,800
because my view goes back two weeks ago

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,280
and your view is from yesterday

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,079
so they're you know you don't just

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,599
simply

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,400
you know um throw out everything that's

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,800
ever come

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
with file system lessons from the last

00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,720
50 years

00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,920
just because you don't have a rotational

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,760
media anymore

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,960
so i think this is a really complicated

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,839
question

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,079
and i um

00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,800
i i i think this is actually a really

00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,040
good time

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,160
in that way because there aren't any

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,559
ideas that

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,920
we shouldn't be trying and we might as

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,119
well try them in an open source

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,400
community

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,079
and i don't think we need to worry about

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
whether

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,400
it's the way things are done today

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,559
because open source

00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,880
all on its own is the way you break away

00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,960
from the way things are done today

00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,000
especially in processors and the fact

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,800
that we'll be resource

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,880
constrained because we'll have an open

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,520
source processor that's slower and not

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,160
as dense

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,720
and not as capable as the bleeding edge

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,440
of the nice processors we get from intel

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,440
amd

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,839
i think that's a good thing you know

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,520
unix originally grew up out of a

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,839
resource constrained machine

00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,760
you had to think a lot and the reward

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,359
was for code you didn't write not for

00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,599
code you did write

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,720
and we need to this is a chance to kind

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,160
of get back to that

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,119
to where we've got to really think a

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,960
little and and emitting code is not the

00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,520
virtue the virtue is showing how you

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,920
don't need to write code

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,200
and i'd love it to to see people from

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,240
this community kind of

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,920
try and look at that model

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,599
so how much code can get rid of it how

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,359
much code can you not write because you

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,280
came up with a good abstraction

00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,440
and then plan nine it's an old code base

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,200
but you know plan nine they really

00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,000
nailed the abstractions they really got

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,400
them right

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,839
and you know there's just lessons and

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,079
lessons and lessons in there and my

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,880
biggest regret i'll stop in a second

00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,880
but my biggest regret when i see a new

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,599
operating system written in rust

00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,079
is that people implement the unix or the

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,559
linux

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,280
avi you know if you're going to begin

00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,680
anew

00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,000
for god's sakes don't don't begin anew

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,599
with a 50 year old design

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,200
you know think think a little look at

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,000
your abstractions that's where

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,160
that's how eunuchs got where it was they

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,319
they got the abstractions right

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,640
and we've really forgotten that lesson

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,119
now i'm done

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,480
yeah i really love the way you talk and

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,000
it's it's something that's very

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,559
difficult uh

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,680
to say him as a german it always sounds

00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,680
like a command

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,599
look a little yeah like commanding

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,359
people but actually um i

00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,640
totally understand where you are coming

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,400
from and

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,960
you you said in a very good and

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,440
understanding way so thank you very much

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,160
ron and we are really getting to the end

00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,880
of this

00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,760
um panel again and i found it super

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,079
interesting

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,680
and and before we close um i would like

00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,960
to make a final round

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,680
um where we have a short outlook a short

00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,880
comments um what we should take away

00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
from this panel and what

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,920
you are taken away from this panel

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,520
and i would like uh to start again with

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,760
the first person on my screen

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,599
uh bunny and you i think bunny always

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,720
looks surprised when i address him

00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,640
but uh bonnie please what

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,920
would you like to take us and what you

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,440
would like to take away

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,440
yourself from this panel

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,880
all right i uh it was interesting i have

00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,839
i

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,359
i have a lot to think about i guess um

00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,799
to hear people's different comments and

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,040
different perspectives on it

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,480
um i was it was actually really good to

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,000
hear ron's comments

00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,720
about his opinions on sort of

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,640
you know giving credit for reducing the

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,920
complexity of things and rethinking

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,880
things from a very low level

00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,440
one of the things we're doing in

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,440
precursors we're trying to really run in

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,799
a very minimal environment and we get a

00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,760
lot of flack for not

00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,000
just running linux on it and and calling

00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,720
it

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,720
a day um you know

00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,960
but uh you know yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,280
try try a stab later this year

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,799
writing even like a file system layer

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,000
that gets rid of the idea of files but

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,680
just as a key value store

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,200
or something like this for a number of

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,119
reasons like just

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,640
reasons right just don't even try to

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,000
argue with me as to why

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,520
i should or shouldn't i've had people

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,799
try to discourage me from doing this say

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,400
why are you crazy just

00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,119
file systems are hard don't do it like

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,119
yeah but you know

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,920
you're like one of the few people who

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,200
said that to me um

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:46,000
but uh but it's uh it's um

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,040
it's interesting just to sort of i i

00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,119
think i think one of the

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,280
honestly just and this is that this is

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,799
more a criticism myself just because of

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,200
the whole pandemic and everything

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,040
i've i haven't this is my this is my

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,359
world like literally you're looking at

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,880
where i sit you know 18 hours a day or

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,720
something like that i don't

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,640
i haven't gone five kilometers in a year

00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,799
or something like that right so

00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,079
so honestly i don't get my head out very

00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,160
much and

00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,760
um unfortunately the internet's been

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,040
really bad about the roommate content

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,480
because everything is now filtered and

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,160
targeted towards me so it's hard to

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,599
discover new ideas and to hear

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,599
fresh opinions of this sort of thing so

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,160
it's actually really nice to just

00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,520
you know just be put in a panel with a

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,280
bunch of people who

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,880
i otherwise wouldn't have had a chance

00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,520
to hear their perspective on and to get

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,280
some

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,640
you know some clarification get myself

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,799
out of my little shell

00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,400
and um and and give me a little bit of

00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,400
things to think about so thanks guys

00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,280
thank you very much and uh yeah going

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,640
over to daniel

00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,599
what's the takeaway would actually like

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,799
to uh

00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:52,160
open up another perspective right now

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:54,319
um so i've um

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,480
i've been attending many many different

00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:58,000
events and conferences over the last

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,119
years

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
you know until covert started

00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,400
and at one of these i met someone who

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,359
recommended me to read a book

00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,119
uh it's called culture and empire by

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:14,160
peter hinches

00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:18,079
and in that book i was reading

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:23,119
that you know technology over time

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:25,599
was always becoming something

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,960
which was more and more accessible to

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,000
everyone

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,559
you know after people who were just rich

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,520
or

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,640
large companies um got their hands on

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,079
them

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:41,440
and that's what i'm seeing now

00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:45,040
on the hardware side as well so if you

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:48,880
just think about it you can already make

00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,799
your own whatever stuff with 3d printers

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,200
people are doing that a lot

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,559
they're sharing all of their designs and

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,520
so on there are large

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,240
platforms for it you can take programs

00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,839
like

00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,040
freecad or kitkat and design your own

00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,920
pcbs

00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,599
just order them in i don't know if

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,680
you're well trained a few minutes i

00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,760
guess

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,760
and likewise with many many other

00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,200
different things

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,680
and i've seen some people

00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,960
also talking about designing their own

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,440
chips now

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,079
of course they will not start right away

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,119
with a

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,599
seven or five nanometer process right

00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,680
um but that's not the point the point is

00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,880
getting started with that

00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:38,960
and if the law is true and

00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,599
so far it holds on you know all layers

00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,599
then this will be a thing in just a few

00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:47,040
years actually

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,160
so that's another perspective

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,599
on looking at risk five or arm more than

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,799
x86 now

00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:58,079
but there is so much more and i

00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:01,599
am very very sure there will be another

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,520
architecture coming up as well

00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,280
so that's my perspective on the future

00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,880
here

00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:12,640
thank you very much and jean-marie

00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,640
what's the takeaway from your side

00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,640
i think the good news first is that we

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,559
are we are still speaking about that

00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,680
about speaking about something hardware

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,119
a year later

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,880
so it means that there is still some

00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,799
interest for that and

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,559
i do see that the interest is growing

00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,480
because um

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,160
i am also a big contributor to the

00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,640
freecad project

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,720
and during the past year we have seen

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,839
our end user base just growing like

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,520
crazy

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,040
i don't know if it was the pandemic

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,520
effect or if

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,200
the open hardware communities are

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:46,079
growing or not but

00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,839
we we are seeing more and more end users

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,119
and more and more contributors to that

00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,400
project

00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,760
and and we have new ideas about how to

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,920
expand this

00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,520
and um i do envision that there is more

00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,400
and more people who are collaborating

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,799
around the world

00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,200
and that is a positive impact of the

01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:06,000
pandemic so we try to

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,760
uh keep working with uh with others and

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,880
the only one way was to use properly the

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,920
internet

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,240
um as i am always saying inside hpe the

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,760
world is not changing in a day

01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,599
but i am super optimistic that within

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,760
the next couple of years we will see

01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,240
more and more but great open hardware

01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,240
ids and designs coming up

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:31,040
and they will be implemented into

01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,760
a big operation i'm optimistic regarding

01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,920
this

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,839
even if i know all the pain that we have

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,640
to go through just to make it a success

01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,420
but

01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,839
but i do believe this is this is doable

01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,839
[Music]

01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,839
now

01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:51,200
thank you very much and uh ron um

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,760
the final words are on to you

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,559
so i was thinking that i was at a dorpa

01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,000
us

01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,520
darfa sponsored project in 1988 where

01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,280
the head of the computing division

01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,960
announced that they were no longer

01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,480
going to fund any operating system work

01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,280
unless it was windows nt

01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,079
because windows nt had barely won right

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,680
so

01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,520
uh by the by the mid late 90s a lot of

01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,559
organizations had given up and were

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,880
ready to surrender to windows nt and we

01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,040
all know the story linux had already won

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,160
by the time darpa thought that eunuchs

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,359
had lost

01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,200
um in 2010 a lot of us in the open

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,119
source community had just basically

01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,880
given up on core booth i'll be blunt a

01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,280
lot of us that decided we lost

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,040
we have a lot of big companies going

01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,720
after us and trying to kill us and we

01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,280
thought they succeeded

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,839
every chromebook sold today runs core

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,359
boot

01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,200
there are more chromebooks than our

01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,040
macbooks today and

01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,799
and i think the lesson from all this i

01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,799
used to say it and i lost faith in it

01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:51,599
for a while and i now believe it again

01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:53,119
open source is always going to win and

01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,599
there are a lot of reasons for that

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,880
one of the reasons is nobody is smarter

01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,280
than the rest of the world

01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,880
so i can have a smart person at a

01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,280
company that's doing a closed source

01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,720
thing

01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,319
they're not smarter than the rest of the

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,319
world so in the end

01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,079
open source wins because nobody's

01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,480
smarter than the rest of the world

01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,599
it's just the way it works so if you

01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,520
ever get discouraged

01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,520
don't open source always wins

01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,240
thank you very much this is the

01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,839
wonderful closing word i see everyone

01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,680
is nodding and yeah i also want to add

01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:28,160
a small um like a few small sentences

01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,480
here

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,440
and which is like um we talked about

01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,319
linux a lot

01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,200
and greg hartman he will be here on

01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,440
tuesday

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,720
giving a keynote um i would like to

01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,799
invite you

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,400
for questions or any comments that you

01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,319
would like to make it's exactly at the

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,000
same time that we're ending now

01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:49,520
this session so in two days um yeah it

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,640
would be nice to have a real

01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,160
um like on-site event because we could

01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,880
go right over

01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,000
and talk to him and yeah at the online

01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,160
event this is not

01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,359
possible in the same way but like let's

01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,440
try so

01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:05,119
and the other thing is like that there

01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,319
are still a lot of topics that we didn't

01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,359
address and daniel

01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:11,440
already opened up a new topic and i i

01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:14,079
think we have like the huge topic of

01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,799
analog computers that some people see as

01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,200
a huge

01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,319
business opportunity now even and for

01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,760
example in germany

01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,079
and there's quite some investment in

01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,119
this area and that we could um

01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,359
address maybe in a future um

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,280
discussion as well and of course like i

01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:31,200
think like the topic of the technology

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,400
stack that's definitely

01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,400
not finished and we probably have

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,640
yeah we need more chances to go into

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,400
detail here so thank you very much

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,039
for this um like really interesting

01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,559

01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,520
early and bunny was

01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,359
in a good time zone it's often not the

01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,480
experience for people in singapore who

01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:57,760
always like have to

01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,839
