00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,080
i am the armor identified as he or his

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,280
i am a brand visual designer from

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,720
nigeria

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,760
west africa i am

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,320
an international speaker if and also a

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,840
founder of

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,240
creative discourse a community that

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,320
helps to teach creators all over

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,439
the world yeah crazy discourse too is

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,800
it helps to make the creators

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,840
uh make money by doing what they love

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,680
okay thank you very much

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,960
so um let's dive in

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,640
into what we have for

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,360
so most of us should know that um

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
we have open source softwares and they

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,120
are well represented with identities

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,719
that suits them

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,719
so we also know that there are some open

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,400
source projects or softwares

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,280
that you see that have uh

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
have some ideas that that are not

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
appealing

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,840
to the eye based on uh inclusive

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,600
and uh yes uh and

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,320
it's been memorable so right now uh

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
i'm here to talk about how you can

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
design

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,720
branded identities for open source

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,119
software is because

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
for about one year and six months i've

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
been into open source and i've been able

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,720
to contribute

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,000
to uh uh some open source organizations

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,560
with my brand design skills

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
so have a question is branding important

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,320
to the open source community

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,520
is it really important is this what uh

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,159
is this what the open source community

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
wants

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,600
are you interested to have a

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,000
professional identity that represents

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,200
each project or each software that has

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,040
been deployed

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
okay so this question is drawn from the

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
fact that

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
most open source softwares are poorly

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,360
designed

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,640
inconsistent and non-memorable

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,560
so stay with me as i

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,520
walk you through the journey of why

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
grand identities

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,760
matter

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,120
so uh before before that uh

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,000
we all should know what brand it is

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
we have a brand we have brand identity

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,160
you know

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,160
brand identity is any uh

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
there's only visual elements it can be

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,040
shaped it can be color

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
you can be a typeface that represents

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,239
the brand

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,080
okay so uh if you can check this

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
most of these are not open so some can

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319
be typeface design

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
and some poster design but all most of

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
the uh

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,560
most of the visual content you can see

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
here are identities

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
so identities are very important in open

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,440
source softwares

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,519
and that's what most from my observation

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
most open source software i see don't

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
have poorly designed

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,000
logos or identities

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,280
so defining the brain identity variety

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
is like the collection of

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
all the elements a company creates a

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
musician creates

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
to protect the right image to each

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,319
consumer

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,440
or customer so in in trying to refer

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,560
uh like branding to marketing practice

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,519
you know it helps it helps to shape

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
just actually helps to shape the shape

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
uh

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
a brand or open source project for

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
example we

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
know about doctor go we also know about

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,599
mozilla

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
you know about firefox all these

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,680
organizations all these projects

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,760
all these softwares have a unique

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,879
identity that represents them

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,879
and brand to say is more like

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,080
you know we've talked about the priority

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,319
so right now

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
has to do with the like the perception

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
of the company in the eyes of the world

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
so yeah and as much as you want you're

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,840
actually

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
getting a brand new she make sure that

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
your brand

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
has the core values i'll be able to

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,680
attract users attract people

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
to come for it so what the brightness

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,400
does that it creates a pathway

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,759
for people to that actually helps to get

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
attraction

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
attraction for people to be able to go

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,440
for these softwares

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
so it's more like uh

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
identity like like whereas the

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,320
professional identities compel

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,440
the users okay what keeps them

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,960
is uh what's what keeps them uh

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,520
is the the company's uh branding

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,240
so brand is not just the identities like

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
it's not just

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
uh not just the logo the typography the

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
color

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
branding also replaces how you deal with

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
your consumers or how due to users or

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
how you interact

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,759
you know the accessibility the

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
inclusiveness and all

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,440
so uh brand editing is quite different

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,639
from brand image

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,600
and branding even though most times

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,360
terms can be can be actually uh be

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
treated interchangeably

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
okay

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,320
so brand they've been an integral part

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,240
of marketing

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,160
yes branding is something that should be

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
considered because when you are

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
building your uh your open source

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
software project

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
you have to market you have to promote

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,960
it okay so

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,680
branding helps to create a pathway

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
that makes it a mess is compelling i

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
mean

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
stand out amongst others okay for

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,759
example i want to give you an instance

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:49,919
how would you feel if uh mozart firefox

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:54,000
mozilla started using um

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,240
python foundations logo how do you feel

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
uh when you see a python foundation

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
using

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,840
mozilla's logo or if you uh eventually

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,840
use it uh

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,080
a video land like vlc media players

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
so it will sound confused so which brand

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
or which organization

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
should have the identities that should

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,479
differentiate them from

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,600
the competitors you know so uh

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
when a good brand is done right it makes

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
impacts

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
and a simple logo like i said like the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
firefox uh

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
first character it becomes a powerful

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,840
advertisement of

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,039
itself you should see you well when you

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,800
go to uh

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
you know the firefox identity the

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,280
firefox now identity

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
you see a vectorized fox i was designed

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,919
does

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,520
it wasn't there not just it was all

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,240
inputted there for

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
a mere reason it's he starts the purpose

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
okay

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,039
he's trying to like become an a popular

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,560
or a powerful advertisement of his

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,120
own okay so most times most identities

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
are

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
different variants we have the mass code

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
we have uh

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,880
we have the uh

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360
you have different types of identity or

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,880
we also have mascots so i think the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,720
firefox logo

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,720
is kind of a mascot okay so um

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,800
i want to encourage brand designers to

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
keep this energy when

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,840
when they're working on open source

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
identity projects

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,560
so is professional brand is really

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,160
important for open source softwares

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,160
of course yes like you need it

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
okay you're working on some projects

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
you're working on

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
a good open source uh project i can

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
remember i

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,520
remember working on accordingly working

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,759
with like foundation public health

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
wanted to shape something around the

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
public health

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
uh uh ecosystem uh we had a new uh a

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,879
kinda different identity for that

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
i was where i was called upon to work on

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,360
it

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
sure and i'm currently working on it

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,240
okay so you can't just start working on

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
that project without

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
needing a unique identity to edit fights

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
that's

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
where branding and branded stick comes

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
in into place okay

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,720
so in in as much as open source

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,919
software's

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,560
uh kind of free and we

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,840
actually have um little paid

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,520
opportunities and

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,520
it's mostly done by volunteers we should

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,039
be able to inculcate professionalism to

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
it like if you're passionate about what

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,840
i've given out

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,680
because you you also know that these

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
software's these open source softwares

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
are

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,680
building will likely solve problems or

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
is going to solve problem in the nearest

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
future

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,680
so i encourage designers brand designers

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,279
especially to give

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,719
all their best when working on open

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,719
source design projects

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,959
uh you also know that open source

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,920
softwares are in a slight competition

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
i must define itself as a viable and

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,040
realistic

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,160
alternative you have other paid

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,399
softwares

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
open soft open source we are not kind of

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,120
paid so

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,200
in as much as they are free yeah

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
that shouldn't mean that like the rate

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,519
of professionalism should be less mean

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
it should be

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,839
higher and we should be able to uh

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,399
like compete with other uh

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,000
with other paid softwares too and let's

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
not forget we are designing to solve

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
problems

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
much for aesthetic so when you're

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,360
creating logos you should make sure that

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,560
you're creating something memorable

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
um something that is timeless and has a

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,040
purpose

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,279
okay yeah so great designs also help

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
to uh give a free and open source

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,600
softwares meaningful

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
uh fast memorable impressions i wouldn't

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,640
like as like does it

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,279
that's the uh honest shoot uh

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,080
great designs will also help to give um

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
open source

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,160
software's credibility trust and

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,279
well-designed

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
lebron awareness like what i said if you

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,760
don't have a unique identity for your

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,920
projects

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
if you intend to start up one you should

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,360
get get a unique identity for it because

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,240
that's what you need for a well-deserved

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,560
brand awareness

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
you can't get to start doing promotions

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,600
you can get started

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,920
at uh without having a professional

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
unique identity that difficult uh uh

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,320
your products or

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,320
your software from others

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,760
yeah a reference what you have right now

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
a reference you should know about pen

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,320
port pen port

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
uh is the first oh whoa fampa is the

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,120
first open source design

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,680
and prototype platform that is used for

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
cross

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,760
domain teams so you can check out uh

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,519
a pen port app you see that it has a

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,480
unique identity

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,839
we also have other design software

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
designer for the type of software's like

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
figma

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,240
we have sketch andres you know yeah pen

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
pals is

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,640
is the first open source design and

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,959
prototyping

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,000
a platform and it's like a big win for

00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,760
all of us

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
okay so if you're a designer i encourage

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,399
you to go check out a pen pot dot

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,079
uh app okay and see the amazing thing

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,720
the app i think the app is on product

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,079
ons

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,880
at the moment you can also get a lss to

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,560
it and do some

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,399
awesome things solve problems with open

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
source softwares like you know it's kind

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
of cool to solve problems with open

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
source softwares

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,399
with open source softwares i don't know

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
if you get me okay yeah

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,079
so uh thanks to the founder and the

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,079
creators of this awesome idea

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,680
okay even open source software uh like

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,640
projects

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,600
itself with a poly design logo a bad

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,320
tagline

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,360
any consistent messaging it will be hard

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
to be noticed

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
i assure you that it's gonna be hard to

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,680
be noticed to be remembered and be taken

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,200
seriously

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,720
okay so uh in as much as we are working

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,920
on this free and open source software

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,320
that we have fully just working on them

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,000
most are paid most some are not paid

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,720
it's like a selfless ads

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,279
we shouldn't like neglect that we should

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,000
giving

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
all our best so first good uh so

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
opposite

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
a project i've been able to contribute

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
i've given in

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,760
my best i've made sure that i've been

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,000
able to solve problems

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,680
yeah i also consider the functional part

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,079
of it not just the aesthetic

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,839
okay so you should make sure that the

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,000
open source software

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
or software or project represents itself

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,639
with

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,120
with a professional logo tagline or

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,880
and or something very consistent in

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,240
terms of brand messaging

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,760
because if you don't do this the project

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,839
or the software we hardly notice

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
remember or taken seriously so this is

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,160
where i

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,320
usually i said i see something about you

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,639
working on open source projects

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,200
and it solves problems on a global scale

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,160
you know so it's some problem like

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,519
global scale you

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
need to have an identity that

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
differentiated from others other

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,120
competitors

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,639
okay like i said earlier you can uh you

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
can't get you can't get to use the

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,040
firefox

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,639
logo for a doctor go or for a github

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,920
okay so if you check both of these

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440
organizations of brandy they have

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,360
identities that are representing them

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
they have unique colors representing

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
them they have dedicated

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
color schemes representing them you have

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,760
customized typefaces representing them

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
so you shouldn't ignore this when it

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,880
comes to branded city

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,360
yo yeah yeah yeah just consider

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
when creating identities for open source

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,240
softwares

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,600
okay let's dive into this because this

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
is where

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
i want to make like a little

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
explanations about

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
things to consider when creating ideas

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
for open source software like i said

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,000
earlier

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
in as much as we are trying to like make

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,560
it beautiful make it

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
uh visually appealing you should not

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
forget that

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,880
these identities have to solve problems

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,760
in terms of brand messaging

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,760
okay so let's dive in let's dive in

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,560
yo things to consider when designing

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,000
practices for open source

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,000
the first one is scalability

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,199
this identity is going to be is this

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
very scalable

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,199
is this something that will be visible

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
upon resize meant like

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,120
is it this is something that's going to

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,120
be visible no matter how you resize it

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,160
okay is this scalable can i be able to

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,920
use it on various cross platforms

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,079
okay can it be um able

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,959
to be visible on some backgrounds that's

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,120
what you have to check

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,800
otherwise when i if your designer here

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,760
listen to this talk

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,560
yeah i'm watching it also make sure that

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,199
editing the

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,000
design are scalable make sure it's very

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,120
scalable because

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,680
yeah as much as my advice is if one

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
design is

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,040
make sure you design on a neutral color

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
like black and white that's how you get

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
to

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
know if it's gonna be scalable on on any

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,880
color platform

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,399
okay yeah so start with the track colors

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,600
and then you get to improve the

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,680
uh the brand colors okay so the the

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,199
the identity has to be scalable the

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,800
second one is has to be very very

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:12,000
versatile

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,000
versatile from any platform

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,639
it has to be playful it has to be

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,079
youthful it has to tell the story

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,240
it has it it has to be my show you know

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,600
it he needs to play so many kind of

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
rules

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,920
but with the mindset of solving one

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,199
particular problem

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
okay i i don't know if you got to see uh

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,199
i'm trying to remember this open source

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
software

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,959
so i saw this identity it was very cool

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,839
it was very beautiful

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,240
the colors were so nice uh it has this

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,440
uh

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,920
these are this outer of

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,839
of operationalism i love the way it was

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,399
creatively designed

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,839
to solve the brand's problem so so the

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,360
identity needs to be versatile if you're

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,600
designing uh

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,959
open source softwares needs to be very

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,160
versatile

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,399
the third one another list that's been

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,160
memorable

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,880
okay like in this memorable

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,199
we don't talk about the brand voice you

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
all

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,680
know about brand voice okay your

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
identity that you design should be

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,320
memorable

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,480
for i want to give an instance for some

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,360
popular brands

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
or softwares that you know that most

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,040
times the

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
the the you can see uh you can see the

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
identities

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,199
the word mark and logo mark

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,440
sometimes you get to see the only it

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
gets the only logo mark

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
sometimes you get to see the world mark

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,880
and this applies to facebook

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
uh branches most times so the agency

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,680
that i

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,839
designed for and the open source

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,600
software needs to be very very very

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,079
memorable yeah it needs to stick

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,000
so when you're designing that's why most

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,839
of when we're designing you have to make

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,160
the culture so many design process to

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,800
make sure that okay what you're working

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
on

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,079
be able to solve problems so you're

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
being memorable

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,919
that's where colors come in that's where

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,799
the icon sits

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,079
coming that's where you actually make

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,400
sure that the visual elements are going

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,600
to

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,360
use around the identity tell a story

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,679
make it stick was just true visual

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,720
storytelling you get to make something

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,600
stick

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,600
okay the next one simplicity

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,600
i don't know if you have gotten to see

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,520
some identities that

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,559
that that has too many contests

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,760
like you have a dove you know there's a

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,200
kind of dope there's

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,320
a glow a globe icon um there is a

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
feather icon

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,480
that is you know some wave icons or

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,679
some so some plus like too many visual

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
elements are trying to like

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,320
compound to represent one identity most

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,440
identities

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,760
might might be good okay but most times

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,039
they don't get to stick that's where

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,960
does it where as

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,960
that's a memorable and simplistic

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,240
because for anything to be memorable

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,799
it has to be simple simple as possible

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
like

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,640
it should be simple the way it

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,480
should be okay so for a little bit

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,559
designing for open source software to be

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,600
rememberable it has to be very very very

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,760
simple

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:31,600
check out the trends if you take from 20

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,320
up to i'm sorry 2001 and 2022. i said

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,960
yeah

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,400
and 2021 you see that you check that

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,919
most identities most logos that i

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
designed way back about 10

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,960
years ago like a decade ago

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
idea is that existing right now quite

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,679
different you see most brown trying to

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,160
like

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,960
change the reds the identities to become

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,520
flat

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,200
for mascots through flat kind of logo or

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,799
to monograms or calligrams

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
that's because i just like aligned with

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
the trends so i think this

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
has to be very simple like i said

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,600
earlier it has to be simple so that can

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
be able to cross across so many

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,880
platforms

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
okay first let me give an instance you

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
all know that there is this little five

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,200
icon like okay

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,799
if i condense uh always at the

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,679
web browser let's imagine you have all

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,679
this that you see

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,799
right now as one identity for

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,400
like one logo for a brand and you need

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,120
to get all these things together as one

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,520
logo and

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,480
it is at the web browser how would you

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
get to

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,240
know that okay this is like this is the

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,559
right identity for this uh

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,679
project for this software you can get to

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,120
know that because it's gonna be

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,640
confusing but there's so many logos

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
there's so many content so many visual

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
elements that are surrounding it

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
but if you have something like this like

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,039
you have the wordpress you have the

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,880
firefox the python the android

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,520
like uh the pine i think this thing

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,559
should be fine then um

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,559
let's try to figure out so like

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,320
with all these identities how simple

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,960
they are and how

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,679
uh like like how memorable they get to

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,600
be

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,919
you can be able to tell tell the brand

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,679
like you check very well you didn't see

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,440
any watermark you didn't see any warmer

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,760
that tells okay this is wordpress

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
or this firefox or this android but

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,280
looking at the identity

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,520
because there is an edit that is very

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,039
simple and memorable and very versatile

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,480
you can be able to know that okay this

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,600
is the one is the opposite level is the

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,799
pythons logo

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,360
is the pine logo you know is the firefox

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,600
logo

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,360
without seeing the word mark so this is

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,080
what professional this is what

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,720
good or great uh local identities should

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
be

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,480
you should be able to solve problems

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
like this on a bigger scale

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
and thank you very much for sticking

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,080
with me throughout this

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,520
