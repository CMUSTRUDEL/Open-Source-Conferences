	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,560
of the session itself recording is on

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,240
uh so let me first take you through an

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,040
overview of blockchain technology

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,360
so if you actually go to google and you

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,120
search up the word blockchain

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,880
and if you see the wikipedia article and

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
see how exactly we keep it and define

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,640
this term blockchain technology you'll

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,840
find that this is

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,199
what it says so it's so basically

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,720
uh you know the in the internet they say

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,160
that blockchain is basically an

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,399
open or decentralized ledger that can

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,600
effectively record transactions between

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
two parties

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
and it can be done so in a verifiable

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
permanent way

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
uh so what does this mean right so

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
that's something that we're gonna

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,559
explore the rest of the session

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,640
what this complicated sentence means in

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,399
reality it's actually quite simple

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
and the underlying technology the

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,199
concepts all of that is very

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
uh easy to grasp so uh you'll

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,879
you'll learn at the end of this workshop

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
that this basically means something very

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,960
simple

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,159
but yet very powerful so

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,000
that's so and also if you look up the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,280
word blockchain uh some of the other

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
words that commonly pop

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,920
up are open distributed safe

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,080
secure permanent so what these terms

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
actually mean in the blocking context

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,720
is something that we're going to explore

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,720
in the subsequent sections

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
so uh let me first start off by saying

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,159
exactly how

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
transactions are recorded in a

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
blockchain so what is a blockchain so

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,400
for us

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
simply put you can think of blockchain

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
as a

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,040
highly distributed database so how did

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,640
so what are the purpose of a database

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,799
a database is something that can

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
basically store data

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
something that you can write data on and

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
something that you can retrieve data

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,799
from

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
and so this is effectively what a

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,200
blockchain is uh except it's

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
it's a much more distributed database

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
and and

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
the access is more democratic so here

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
are the various steps

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
in which you can actually write data

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,640
onto a blockchain

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,319
so in the blockchain context when we

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
generally referred to

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,160
you know the act of you know recording

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,200
data into the blockchain as

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,480
uh recording a transaction or or

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,680
verifying a transaction so here so this

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
that's one thing i'd like you to know

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,319
the transaction can basically represent

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
any data

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,720
that is to be recorded into a blockchain

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
so here are the various steps

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,840
in which one can do so so the first step

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,319
is when a

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,319
user actually requests for a transaction

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,400
so he requires for a certain data to be

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,800
written onto the blockchain

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
as a second step a list of all

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
transactions

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,879
is now collectively represented as a

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,160
block and now this block is created so

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
suppose you have

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
say 50 or 60 transactions that you'd

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
like to record instead of simply

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
verifying one transaction at a time

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,680
they say okay let me combine all of them

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,040
to form what is known as block

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,680
and let me instead verify this block

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,519
and now how traditional uh payment

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,319
processors or how traditional systems

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
work

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,879
are that they're generally only one

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,879
person that gets to decide exactly

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
you know what data gets written onto the

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
database and and

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
and what gets registered but that's not

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
so the blockchain context

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,920
so you need to seek validation and you

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
need to seek permission

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,959
from all the participants in the network

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
to write

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,959
data onto a blockchain and so that is

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
the third step where this block of

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,200
transactions

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120
is not publicized to an entire network

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
so all the participants that actually

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,080
form this network

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,440
get to know what this block exactly is

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
and what are the transactions that are

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,080
recorded in this block

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,040
so that is the turnstile and the final

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
step

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
is when all participants actually

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560
validate the transactions

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,480
when all participants say that okay i

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,280
verify that all these transactions are

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
legitimate

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
and verify that the data that is written

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,879
that that has been submitted

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,640
is something that is accurate and we'd

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
like to write on the blockchain

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
and when once that that process of

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
verification is done

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
the block gets added into the chain this

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
is the various steps in which

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,640
one can actually write data onto a

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,519
blockchain you can basically think of

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,360
blockchain as a

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,360
highly distributed database

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,840
now let's talk a little bit more about

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,759
the key features of blockchain

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,960
so i'll be actually deep diving into

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,960
each of these features

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
uh decentralization immutability and

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
traceability

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,680
i'll actually be covering a lot more

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,919
than what is there in the slides

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
but i i generally prefer to keep my

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,000
slides very minimalistic

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,759
and deep dive into the content on top of

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
what is already being displayed

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,720
and so we'll actually be going a lot

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,840
deeper into each of these three features

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,880
so let's talk about decentralization

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,479
so uh the way i cover these three

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,160
key features is that first i talk a

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,680
little bit more about

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
some of the terms that you need to be

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680
familiar with in order to follow with

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,840
this conversation

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
after that i'll talk about what this

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
term exactly

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
means and then i shed a little more

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,440
light

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
into the issues that we have uh which

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,720
are associated with this property of

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,639
blockchain technology

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
i talk a little bit more about why this

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
property becomes important

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
and how it is achieved in the blockchain

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
context

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,639
and i also be providing some examples

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
about of which applications actually use

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,080
this concept of blockchain technology so

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,479
that's how i'll basically go through

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
these

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,880
three key features of blockchain and so

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
let's start off with the first one

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,840
the first one and probably the most

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
common one is actually something called

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,280
decentralization

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,800
so what is decentralization so the

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
the property of a system being

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
decentralized is

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
when all power is actually distributed

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,600
and dispersed away from

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
a central authority so most if you look

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
at most financial

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,080
as well as government systems today they

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
are highly

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
centralized in nature what me what this

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
means is such

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
in such systems there exists a central

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
authority

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
which is actually in charge of

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
maintaining and managing these systems

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
for example if you take a look at bbs

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,520
payla right suppose you have two people

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,759
person a and person b

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
and suppose person a wants to send say

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,680
ten dollars

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,280
to person b through dps pillar

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,199
so it is actually that centralized

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
authority that is dps bank

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,960
it gets to approve okay that this

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,199
transaction is valid

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,639
and that uh you know persons a bank

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
account is now this much

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
uh you know like like suppose it was

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
hundred dollars before now it's now he

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,759
sent ten dollars so it's going to be 90.

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
so that process of validation and

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,319
verification is actually done by a

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
centralized authority in a single person

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
it is not done by

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,440
multiple people and multiple nodes in

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
the network and so that is essentially

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,360
what decentralized wants to

00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,800
uh decentralization wants to avoid

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,319
so basically decentralization is refers

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
to the dispersion delegation or

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,720
distribution of power

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,280
away from a centralized authority

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,160
so there are actually several forms of

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,400
decentralizations with various

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,120
varying degrees and uh so each one have

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,880
each level of you know decentralization

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,720
in each form

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
has different properties and we have to

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
consider different

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,880
tradeoffs before actually making a

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,199
decision on which one is the best

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,280
so if you see how decentralizations

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
actually implemented in practice

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,639
you can be decentralized in terms of

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,400
architecture

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,720
culture control and decision making

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,639
so what does architecture refer to so

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
basically architecture sets force the

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,280
different roles of network

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,759
participants and how they interact

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,599
so a highly decentralized architecture

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
will ensure that all peers have the

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
exact same role

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
and thus exert the exact same amount of

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
influence on the network

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,840
however if you look at centralized

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,039
systems they would generally give a

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
single peer

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280
almost full control of the network while

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,759
other participants in the network

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,800
can actually interact with the network

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,000
in very limited ways

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,520
uh so this actually also affects to a

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,440
great degree the consensus

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,199
protocols that are used in various

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,479
blockchain systems water conservancies

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
protocols is something that we'll be

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,080
studying

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,039
soon also now let's move on to culture

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
so what does culture mean exactly so

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,640
culture

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,360
actually defines the social norms of the

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,880
people that

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,320
interact with the network so if you take

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,599
a look at a

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
uh you know technology ecosystem

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,000
the culture and and the interactions

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
could actually be in terms of developers

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
that want to build

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,880
software on the network so you have like

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
a network and people would like to build

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,959
certain applications some software

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
applications on that network itself so

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
that can be one way

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
in which you know there is interaction

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,040
with the network

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
another way in which there is

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
interaction with the network are through

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,959
our researchers who basically would like

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
to investigate the potential and

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,240
pitfalls in the network

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,000
and so interactions can basically also

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,440
mean anyone who has a stake in it so

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,440
even a simple

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
node and a simple participant in the

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
bitcoin network who wishes to mine some

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,279
bitcoin

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,640
they themselves so that interaction with

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,240
the network also

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,720
comes under this category of culture

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
so uh one more thing about

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,600
decentralization

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,480
is that decentralization can also be

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,880
achieved through culture

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
another way in which we can have you

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,000
know some some amount of degree of

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,200
decentralization

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,519
is in control so control of the network

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,080
can be done in several ways

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
but it ultimately boils down and results

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,440
to the

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,040
governing of the network's participants

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,000
and when i say governing of network

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,839
participants

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,079
this could involve basically legal

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
structures as to how the network is

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,279
funded

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,160
the amount of changes each peer can

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,240
basically make

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,800
on the network itself so that is what i

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,880
refer to when i say control

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,000
and finally a system can also be

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
decentralized

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,480
in terms of the decision making process

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,959
the decision making processes basically

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,720
determine the growth of each network

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,720
and it also helps in weighing the

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
trade-offs that they that need to be

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
taken

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,959
so as blockchain technology is

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,240
relatively new

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,079
and there are challenges which are

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
unsolved and unforeseen

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,200
having a very robust decision making

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
process

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
is actually important to ensure the

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,519
network can evolve

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
and adapt to each challenge be it a

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,320
social challenge

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,079
of people wanting to adopt the

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
technology or even a technical

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,760
challenge that needs to be overcome in a

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,760
hurdle that needs to be crossed

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,440
for the network to scale so this concept

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,839
of decentralization is actually

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,680
fundamental to blockchain technology

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,760
and this is the key value proposition

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,079
for most of the use cases of blockchain

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
today

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,560
so decentralization can be viewed from a

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,279
blockchain perspective

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,079
as a mechanism that provides a way to

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,880
remodel

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,360
existing applications and paradigms or

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
build

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,600
new applications in order to give full

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,959
control to the users that is the key

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
point that i'd like to drive home

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,680
where decentralization gives full

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,839
control to all its users

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,440
so there are today if we take a step

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,839
back and see how

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
well such a solution is being you know

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
accepted

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,360
or you know used in the industry today

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,839
there are actually very conflicting

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
ideas on the importance of

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,399
decentralization

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
but one thing that everyone can

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,720
basically agree upon is that it

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,360
completely removes the need

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
for trust when more than one party comes

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
together

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,120
to collaborate so this actually gives

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,440
rise to new types of goods and services

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
which are still untested and still need

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
to be evaluated

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,360
but the right now the

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,600
the potential for such applications

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,200
seem very very promising

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
now what are some of the issues that you

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,639
face when you actually would like to

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,399
implement decentralization on a

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
blockchain network

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,120
the first and most common issue is the

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,399
issue of scaling

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,639
so what is the issue of scaling so there

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
are actually many challenges in keeping

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,360
a network decentralized

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,639
one actually intends to grow the network

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,240
and include more number of participants

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
so it makes sense right like suppose you

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,560
have a network of say five people

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
uh having all five people come to the

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,079
same page

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
or agree uh at certain decisions or come

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,240
together for consensus

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,040
is actually much easier than if you say

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,519
have 20 people 30 people 40 people or so

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,480
on so as in when your network grows

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,240
it becomes very hard to involve everyone

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,959
in making decisions that pertain to the

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,959
network

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,320
and so that is a key problem that

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,959
actually plagued

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
you know even very common uh networks

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,920
such as the ethereum network so how many

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,320
of you are familiar with the ethereum

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
network

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,720
so ethereum is actually the second

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
largest cryptocurrency by market

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
so this is actually something that

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,440
played the ethereum network

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,399
and the common problem was uh seen

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,720
through transaction speeds

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,760
so uh the transaction speeds used to be

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
very very large

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,839
as in when the network decided to grow

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,880
and include more participants because it

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,440
became very hard

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,680
to reach consensus you know for everyone

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
in the network to reach consensus

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,800
so some of the solutions that was

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,399
actually proposed

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,680
to address this issue of scaling

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,000
is lowering the level of

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,560
decentralization which could be a

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,399
trade-off for faster transactions

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
but this actually fundamentally lowers

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,959
the level of security of the network

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
as this increases the need for trusted

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,040
parties

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,720
so that is one common issue that is uh

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
you know that we face when we try to

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,839
implement decentralization

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,959
the blockchain network itself another

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,600
issue is the issue of economics

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,959
so as and when a network grows one can

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
actually not predict

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
how its peers might interact when using

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,560
utilizing the

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,040
resources that the network itself

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
provides

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
so what do i mean by this and and one of

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,639
the common examples that we see

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,199
which is the issue that is you know

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,560
being broadcasted in real life

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,560
so uh the common issue that we can see

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,199
when we talk about economics is the

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,639
issue of mining pools or centralized

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
mining exchanges

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
so even though the blockchain network is

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,959
meant to be decentralized

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,720
you can have many peers and many

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,120
participants coming together

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
to collectively mine on the network and

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
so this actually led to

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,480
high levels of centralization in the

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,839
network which is done through something

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
that is known as mining foods

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
so these are the two main challenges

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,760
that are faced by anyone

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
who would like to implement

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,760
decentralization

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,199
in real life now

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,959
we should take a step back and ask

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,959
ourselves why do we need

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,760
decentralization what is the purpose

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,160
that decentralization actually serves

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,320
so the first point is that it actually

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
allows for greater participant

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,040
participation between non-trusted

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,279
parties so we just spoke about how

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
when we have a decentralized system the

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,320
need for trust

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
is completely removed from the network

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,639
as you don't have any middle

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,560
man anymore as you have as all the

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,720
controls is actually given to the user

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,199
there is no need of trust between

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,959
parties

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,120
the second reason is that there is

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,519
better reliability in your network

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,240
as you do not actually rely directly on

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
centralized immediate

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,839
[Music]

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,680
so these are the two main reasons why we

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,120
would like decentralization to be

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,920
implemented in real life systems

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,079
how is decentralization achieved so in

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,639
the bitcoin network for example

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
decentralization is actually achieved in

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,639
terms of full nodes

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,839
and light nodes what is full nodes and

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,279
what is light nodes

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
is something that leave up to you to

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,480
kind of search and

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,079
research and read up a little bit more

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
about so there's one thing about this

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,680
workshop i'd like to highlight here

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,600
so a lot of things i'll be laying down

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
the foundations and giving you the basic

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,360
prerequisite knowledge that is required

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,360
but i'll be leaving a lot of things for

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,440
you to kind of discover on yourself

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,959
because i feel that the entire process

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
of self discovery

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,240
of you know going on to google you know

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,800
typing up the words

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,560
reading a little bit more about you know

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
what these concepts mean

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,720
is very crucial and actually in your

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,240
learning journey so i'll leave that up

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,759
for all of you to to to uh

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,759
you know read a little bit more about

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,399
okay uh so how how can you be

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,679
decentralized in terms of culture

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,520
so we are in force asia right and and

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,559
what is the key

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,319
uh you know cultural belief of asia it

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,880
is the open source culture

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,720
and they are actually high advocates of

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,880
this entire open source culture

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,520
so what is open source itself is an

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,640
ethos that values collaboration

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,880
on community projects and so this

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,400
is another way in which decentralization

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,679
can actually be achieved

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
in terms of culture so if you take a

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,559
look at

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,160
you know organizations like fosatia or

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,640
the linux foundation

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
so all of these are very successful open

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
source foundations

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
in fact if you take if you talk a little

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
bit more about the linux foundation

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,360
uh their involvement in the blockchain

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
industry is actually through the

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,280
hyperledger project

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,000
which is another open source blockchain

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
uh project

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,039
how about control how can you be

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,360
decentralized in terms of cultural

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,039
so is so we know uh something that's

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
very commonly known as the ethereum

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,080
foundation

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,919
which is basically an organization uh

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,160
that is that basically runs

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,400
and and and caters more towards the

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,480
scaling up and the development of the

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
ethereum network so it's actually

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
incorporated as a swiss

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,679
non-profit at zug it's switzerland i'm

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
not sure if that's the current

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,799
pronunciation that's

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,640
but yeah and how do you have how how

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,240
how does the ethereum foundation ensure

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
that everyone has control over the

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
network

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,760
so they provide grants that paid teams

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,360
to actually work on projects

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,440
that involve the ethereum network itself

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,679
now how can you be decentralized in

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,720
terms of decision making

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,000
so a common example is what is known as

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,919
ethereum improvement proposals or eips

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,320
so these are actually standards that

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,360
specify potential new features

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,880
or pro processes for ethereum

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,919
so if you take a look at an eip an eip

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
should actually contain

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
technical specifications of the proposed

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,039
chains

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,640
and should also act as a source of truth

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,760
for the entire community to refer to

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,919
so so in ethereum all network upgrades

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
and application standards are actually

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,320
discussed and developed

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,240
through ethereum improvement proposals

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,000
so this is currently how all decisions

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,360
pertaining to the ethereum network are

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
made

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,600
uh the most common erp that just passed

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,240
very recently which has a great

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,320
impact on the transaction free market is

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,919
actually eip1559

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,840
that's something that you can also you

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
know go and read a little bit more about

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
and

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
find out more about yourself

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,559
uh now let's move on to the which

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,120
portion of this section

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,679
so uh which applications actually make

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
use

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
of this property of decentralization

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,880
itself

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,880
so we have a self-sovereign identity

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,160
where users can actually manage their

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
own reputation

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,960
data and digital assets

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,480
so id 2020 actually supports digital

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,480
identity programs

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,919
across the world another application is

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,960
the application of decentralized

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
exchanges

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,320
so we all know how traditional exchanges

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,039
work

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,960
for you know buying selling and trading

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,880
you know your financial assets

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
but you also have something that is

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,600
known as decentralized exchanges

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,679
which require no central coordination

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,360
between the parties and all participants

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,960
that would actually like to buy and sell

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,799
these assets

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,240
and so all participants basically

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,760
interact entirely

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,760
on the basis of incentives

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,559
so this is concludes the first section

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,360
on decentralization so we spoke a little

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,440
bit more about what decentralization is

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,480
what are the issues that people face

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,360
while trying to implement

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,200
decentralization in real life

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,840
uh which are the examples that actually

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,440
make use of decentralization

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,039
and how it's being achieved in various

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,440
networks and also why it is important

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,600
to have a network that is entirely

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,760
decentralized

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
so that is the first portion and that is

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,159
the first key feature of blockchain

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,919
technology

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,760
decentralization let's now talk about a

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,760
little bit more about the second

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
key feature of blockchain technology

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,320
which is the property

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,320
of immutability

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,440
so another a few set of terms that you

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,640
need to familiar be familiar with

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,799
in order to keep up with this

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,120
conversation of immutability

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
is number one what is a fork in a

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
network

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,080
so a fork is essentially a change to the

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,080
protocol

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,559
or a divergence from the previous

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,440
version of the blockchain so let me try

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,799
and pull up

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,000
a pictorial representation of what a

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:59,840
blockchain fork is for you to understand

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,840
this a little bit better

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,919
yep this is essentially what a

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,919
blockchain fork is

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,080
so let's take a look at this picture

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,120
so uh it basically refers to a change to

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,039
the protocol

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,320
but a divergence from the previous

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,919
versions of the blockchain so if you

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
look at previous versions right

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,480
they follow the old rule they follow the

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,559
old rule and so on but suppose you would

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,200
like to go back to this block

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,799
and implement a certain change uh from

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,799
the previous version

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,559
and also diverge from certain decisions

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,679
that were made from going from this

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,679
block to this block

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,880
you essentially created a new fork in

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,320
the network

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,520
and in this fork from from this fork

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
onwards

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,679
all these blocks will follow a new set

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,559
of rules that have been implemented

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:57,120
while forking from this spot yes

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,039
so this is blocks from non-updated nodes

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,799
these are the blocks from upgraded nodes

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,600
so this is a pictorial representation of

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,159
what a hard

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
fork is well is a pictorial

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,440
representation of 14

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,880
in block in in general

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
let me go back to my slides

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
yeah so there is one term that you need

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,320
to be familiar with

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,320
another term is the blockchain explorer

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,919
so a blockchain explorer is actually a

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
tool that you can traverse

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,280
uh that you can use to traverse

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
blockchain records

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,039
and yeah so that that's something that

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,760
we will actually play around with also

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
later when

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
when talking more about immutability i

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,320
will give you the link to actually play

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,080
around a little with the blockchain

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,799
bitcoin blockchain explorer and then you

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
can just you know

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,159
try your hand and see all the

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,480
transactions

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,480
uh that was recorded in the bitcoin

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
another term that i'd like to talk about

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,880
is the term called hashing

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,200
so what is the meaning of a hash a hash

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
is actually a one way function that

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,640
generates values

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,799
from a string of text so if you look at

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,159
mathematics right what is a function

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,240
so a function suppose you have a

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,880
function say f of x

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,400
and you give it an input x you get a

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
certain output so that is essentially

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,559
what a function is you can think of it

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,600
as a black

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,520
box that takes in a certain input

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,080
and gives out a certain output so that

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,720
is exactly what a function is

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,520
now what is a hash a hash is actually a

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,600
function

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,559
which generates values from a string of

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,320
text

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,880
which is pre-image resistant which means

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,640
that suppose you have a function h of x

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,440
which is known as a hash function

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
and you're given input x it gives an

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,279
output y

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,559
if you know the output y you cannot

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,520
guess the input x

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,840
just by knowing the function and the the

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,919
the

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
output y itself so that is one property

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,559
of hashing functions so you cannot

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,440
guess the input from knowing the output

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,679
that is exactly

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,880
the key idea of what a hashing function

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,039
is

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,159
and it is also collision resistant what

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,600
is the meaning of consolidation

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,799
resistance

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,919
suppose i have to input a and b the hash

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
function will now provide

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,679
a unique output for each of these inputs

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,760
a or b

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,640
so which means that there is actually no

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,840
way in which you can have two inputs

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,520
that can give the same

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,200
output on hashing a function okay

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,520
so that is what a function hash is

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,840
i hope all of you are able to fall

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,720
follow right now

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,559
and uh another thing that that we like

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,240
i'd like you to be familiar with

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,120
is the meaning of the word fungible

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,559
so fungible is basically being something

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,919
of such a nature

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,679
that one can part or whether that one

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,520
part or quantity

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
may be replaced by another part or

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,440
quantity in paying that

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,120
or settling an account so there is the

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
technical you know definition of

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,080
fungibility

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,360
uh but the main example i can give for

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
fungibility

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,799
is your currencies now suppose i give

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,760
you one dollar today

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,440
and you pay me back the debt tomorrow

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,520
you need not necessarily give me the

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,799
same one dollar note i gave you you can

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
give me any one dollar

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,960
and so that's currencies are actually

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,200
fungible in nature

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,279
okay so that is a little bit more about

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
fungibility

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,279
okay so that is the terms that i need

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,559
you to be familiar with in order to keep

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,039
up with this discussion

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,840
and this is the discussion itself so

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,039
let's start

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,600
let's talk a little bit more about

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:40,559
immutability so what is immutability

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,679
so through immutability all transactions

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,480
in the blockchain

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,120
is actually made reliable by making it

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,240
completely

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,640
unchangeable by any single party

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,520
this actually ensures that all activity

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,840
records

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,799
and network participation rules are

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,159
agreed upon

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,080
and cut until all necessary parties

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,760
agree to change them so it's not a

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,799
single party that can decide how to

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
change these rules

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,200
but it's actually all the necessary

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,360
parties so what this essentially means

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
is that through immutability the

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,360
blockchain has the ability

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,840
to ensure that the data that is written

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,960
on it can never be altered so this is

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,159
actually

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,640
makes the blockchain tamper so if you

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,720
have

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
malicious nodes and malicious

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,840
participants who would like to come and

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,039
change the data on this network they

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,360
cannot do so

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,279
but if you look at traditional databases

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,080
uh through you know through

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,960
many attacks it is actually possible to

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,799
rewrite

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,039
and change the data that is written on

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,200
these you know databases so it's not

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,080
completely tamper proof but a blockchain

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,799
is 100 and that is the property of

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,799
immutability

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,559
so uh how is immutability actually

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,080
achieved

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
so the structure of the blockchain

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,679
itself allows

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,600
for the ability of individuals to

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,679
independently verify the state of the

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,760
network

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,240
so each peer can basically compute the

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,120
blockchain according themselves

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,799
and they can replicate the changes in

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,600
the state of the network

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,600
by themselves

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,880
so a malicious peer will basically have

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,679
to compute the consensus protocol

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,000
for blocks that have already been mined

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
and

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
out compete all the miners and broadcast

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,520
their blocks first

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,559
to every clear in order to change data

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,000
that is written in the blockchain and

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,200
this is nearly or

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,679
i can actually say this is almost 100 uh

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,399
impossible unless you have a very hard

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,399
fork

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,520
in the network a hard like the hard part

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,880
which i just spoke about in the

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,039
beginning of this

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,320
section so uh how exactly is this

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,679
achieved so basically

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,679
so what so what i just said right so

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,440
this all essentially boils down to the

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,559
structure of the blockchain itself so if

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
you didn't understand

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,960
in put in simple terms this is how

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,159
immutability is actually achieved in the

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
network

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,640
so each block in the blockchain is

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,960
actually cryptographically secured

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,880
and is given a unique digital signature

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,240
which is known as the hash value of the

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,080
block

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,360
now any change in the data that has been

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,039
written on the block or

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,880
any changes in the transactions that

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,480
have been recorded on that particular

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,679
block

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,200
will change the block's hash value

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,600
now what is really unique about the

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,000
blockchain is that the hashing of one

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,919
chain

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,679
actually not only uses the data that is

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,399
written on that block

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
but actually also uses the metadata from

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,279
the previous block

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,960
which means that any change in the data

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,440
that has been recorded in the previous

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,600
block

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,559
will also alter the hash value of the

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,159
next block

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,600
and that is how you create an

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,000
unbreakable bond of

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,279
blocks and that is how blockchain

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,960
actually gets its name

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,200
it's essentially a chain of blocks

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,159
so once these the data has been written

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,840
on the blockchain

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
and all the transaction has been

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,159
approved and accepted

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,039
the data on the blocks can no longer be

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,240
altered

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:10,640
so this is immutability in a nutshell

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,159
okay so uh now what are the issues when

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
it comes to immutability let's talk a

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,799
little bit more

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,960
about what are some of the challenges

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,159
that we face when we try to

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,039
uh you know implement immutability the

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,080
first chain

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,600
is as i mentioned hard forks so uh

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,799
rewriting large portions of the

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,399
blockchain

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,840
means that the records are not

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,919
absolutely immutable

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,120
so i just showed you how we can actually

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,279
deviate from the

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,799
old rules and follow new rules so that

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,120
is one challenge when it comes to

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,039
immutability

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,840
a second main issue that i'd like to

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,480
highlight here is the issue of

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,159
irreversibility

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,760
so which means that suppose wrong

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,640
actions are actually accepted in the

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,159
blockchain

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,080
and once they have been successfully

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,679
recorded uh

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,519
these actions can not easily be reversed

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,799
so it's not easy for someone to go and

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,000
undo a mistake

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,840
that was actually recorded in the

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
blockchain because the process because

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,919
of

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,240
the property of immutability

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,600
so in fact vulnerable smart contracts

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,720
what are smart contracts is something

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
that we'll talk about later in the

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,000
session

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,240
so it can actually be easily decompiled

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,720
and exploited

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,399
so almost the very common example of

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
this situation was actually the tao

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,360
attacker

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,360
so i don't know if you guys are familiar

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,640
but there was someone who actually

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,120
launched a full scale in a you know

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,399
an attack on the ethereal network and

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,519
this actually caused

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,640
a loss of 70 million dollars because of

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,320
this one

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,799
you know this one attack that was

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,799
launched and now because of immutability

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,159
it was very hard for anyone to reverse

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,679
this attack because

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,600
once the data has been written on the

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,559
block it becomes very hard to actually

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,480
reverse

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:55,279
this process so that is the issue of

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,519
immutability

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,360
now let's talk about why do we need our

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,960
blockchain systems to be immutable

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
why should we why why why is there a

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,640
need for immutability

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,000
so the first point is that it sets forth

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,360
a new paradigm

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,919
by no longer requiring record keeping

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,919
intermediaries

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,159
so you no longer need a middleman who

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,559
can actually keep the records for you

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,320
but instead the records are entirely on

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,559
your hand

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,440
and they're also tamper proof and it

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,600
also once again

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,840
overcomes the need for trust in record

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,760
kept as you can verify

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,840
the transactions of the block and you

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,720
can verify the data on the blockchain

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,720
independently

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,279
okay but before we continue forward i'd

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,159
like you to all to you know

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,360
uh check out you know a block explorer

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,080
actually we'll do that in the next

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,919
section

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,120
you know of traceability it's okay okay

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,000
we'll just continue on to the session

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,679
for now

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,600
okay never mind sorry my bad

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,720
okay so now let's talk a little bit more

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,559
about how

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,840
uh immutability is achieved in the

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,840
blockchain context

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,159
so if you look at blockchain systems

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,399
the the transactions are actually

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,760
verified and are embedded with the

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,360
timestamp

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,200
and these timestamps are basically

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,799
secured uh

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
in the form of digital signatures and

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,120
hashes which are clearly which i

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,120
mentioned before

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,440
so like how i mentioned an unbreakable

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,640
bond of you know of blocks or chain of

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,120
blocks are formed

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,399
uh by involving the you know the the

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,240
data of the previous block and the

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,360
metadata of the previous block

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,600
in the hashing process of the next block

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,279
so that the so yeah so this is basically

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,039
how uh

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,519
you know immutability is achieved in the

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,279
blockchain context

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,799
so if you take a look at what all we've

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,159
discussed uh that is what is

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,960
immutability

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,480
uh the issues with immutability uh how

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,120
it's achieved in the blockchain context

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,200
and why

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,960
here's a quick summary to basically

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,799
summarize and put all of this together

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,240
in a single lecture

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,440
so in summary new records keep the hash

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,039
of previous block

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,760
in a unique digital signature and miners

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,879
compete

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,119
to find the signature of the next block

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,079
and that is new records what is old

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,079
records

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,200
older cards can basically be easily

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,280
verified

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,040
that previous blocks are correct and

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,679
this can be done so by hashing the

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
blocks

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,079
and checking the nonsense are correct

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,079
itself

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,079
let's now talk a little bit more about

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,240
which so which

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,280
examples actually show this property of

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,000
immutability

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,359
in the blockchain context uh the first

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,040
one is the erc

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,200
721 standard so erc721 tokens

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,800
are actually used to emulate rare

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,200
collectible items

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,720
and these tokens are non-fungible so we

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,679
spoke about fungibility right that when

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,000
you have sale

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,599
like when i give you one dollar uh you

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,119
can pay me back by giving me the same

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,720
one dollar not on another one dollar

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,520
note it makes no difference

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,000
but non-fungibility basically means the

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,320
opposite

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,320
of this

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,200
yeah sure sure i'll i'll make that

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
available as well

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,520
uh it's more of some speaker knows that

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,320
i take it now

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,320
yeah okay okay

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,000
oh i see okay yeah that's right i

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
actually prefer to make my slides very

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
minimal

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,400
in that sense it only covered like

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,040
certain points so that all the attention

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,880
can be

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,680
to the speaker himself yeah

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,400
so so erc721 tokens are actually not

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,160
fungible

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,000
which means that every token is unique

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,599
in its own way

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,119
okay so that concludes the discussion

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,720
and immutability

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
now before going to the third and the

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
last property of traceability i think i

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
will

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,960
answer any questions that all of you

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,839
might have so are there any questions

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,839
that you'd like to ask

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,520
so that is one thing in which the entire

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
uh uh

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,480
cis the the the the network was divided

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,320
so you had half the network which said

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,599
that they wanted to fork and undo and

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,400
reverse this

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,440
famous hacker attack and he had another

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,359
uh

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,320
half of the network who said that it's

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,160
okay we should live with the

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,240
consequences of what just happened

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
and we'd continue with the loss of 70

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,560
million and so because of that there was

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,560
a heart for

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,000
so so there are some people who are so

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,400
that actually gave birth to what is

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,880
known as ethereum classic

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,520
so i guess is a very nice good thing

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,520
that you brought it up

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,240
so there has actually been some movement

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,839
so uh because there was still like

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,280
there was a division in the network and

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,520
there were still people who would

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
prefer to mine on ethereum classic so

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,839
there's still

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:22,560
coins that are being mined on on that uh

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,119
as well so it is

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,640
uh so bitcoin also they did have a

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,200
fourth at one point

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,880
uh yeah so so yeah so that's also very

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,839
interesting so we do have you know

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,839
two versions of bitcoin as well

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
that's another challenge of immutability

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,720
like both of them exactly what i said so

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
when someone launches an attack you

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,160
either live with the consequences

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,880
because you can't change the data

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,920
or you have to fork which is again going

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,240
to be another

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,960
issue that that rises when we talk about

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,960
repeatability

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,000
yes exactly exactly that's exactly

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
okay

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,400
sorry everybody

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,280
yes yes

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
yes yes this is correct it's correct

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
okay

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,480
uh i have a couple of questions here

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,880
which with regards to the slides

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,839
so yes i can try and share a copy of the

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,839
slides with you

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,839
just give me a second

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,839
yes so i have just shared with all of

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,960
you a copy of the slide so you can refer

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,440
to that

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,119
and yes so we we are actually still on

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,240
the same slide because i've kept my

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,880
slides to cover

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,560
uh just the overview of the content so

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,359
what i'll be explaining is actually

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,400
going much beyond the slides so yeah so

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,000
it is intended to

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,320
to stay and remain in the same slide

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,320
actually

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,560
hope that answers all queries are there

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,400
any other questions with regards to the

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,960
content or anything itself

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,280
that you'd like to ask so i'll pause and

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:11,839
wait a bit at the stage

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:11,839
and answer anything that comes up

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,400
so i think then if if that's if

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,760
everyone's okay with what's happening so

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,880
far then we can move on to the

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,680
next part of the conversation uh

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,880
so let me just quickly check if my

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,400
screens are shared okay

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,640
so let's move on to the next and the

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
final key feature of blockchain

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,839
technology

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,480
uh which is the property of traceability

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,000
so uh here are another set of terms two

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,839
terms which i'd like you to be familiar

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,760
with before we talk about reasonability

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,640
itself uh the first term

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,480
is an address so what is an address a

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,000
blockchain address is actually similar

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,880
to an email address

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,800
and uh so what this is actually used for

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,640
is that it is used to receive

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,040
and send transactions in the blockchain

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,640
network so every time you actually make

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,359
a certain transaction

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,440
on the network so what so what gets

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,319
recorded is that a person with this

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,240
address

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,520
made this transaction so that that is

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,040
something that you need to be familiar

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,119
with

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,960
another term which uh i'd like to define

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,480
before talking about traceability

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,400
is i think something that all of you

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,319
might have already heard about

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,839
and it is a term that is known as mining

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
so i'm pretty sure all of you would have

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,520
heard

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,720
about this term if you are familiar

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,880
uh with bitcoin or any cryptocurrency

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,839
but basically mining is a process

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,480
through which new

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,560
uh cryptocurrencies are basically

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,760
launched onto the market

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,359
so uh people or these so-called miners

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,319
actually work with very powerful

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,680
computers to solve complex mathematical

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,200
problems to actually validate

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,800
transactions that is how the entire

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,400
process of bitcoin mining actually works

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,319
so this is a two term that i'd like you

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,200
to know about and take note of

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,040
when we talk about traceability so let's

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,720
talk about traceability so what is

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,599
traceabilities there are two

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,480
main aspects to traceability the first

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,440
aspect

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,119
is the ability to hide links between

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,720
transactions and addresses

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,480
which are important due to privacy

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,720
concerns and

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,079
the second uh key field like second

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,000
point about traceability

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,839
is that it is easy to match each

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,760
transaction to the address on the

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,960
blockchain

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,760
so you can actually match the

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,960
transactions to the address quite easily

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,960
through what is known as a block

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,119
explorer so in a block

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,000
explorer you can basically view any

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,839
block

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
and what you can see through these

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,119
explorers are you can see all the

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,760
transactions that have been submitted

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,280
and that are part of this block you can

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,599
see the miner

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
who has mined this block and you can

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,400
also

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,400
take a glimpse into the block structure

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,680
itself

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,760
so uh i'd like to all to actually open

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:57,040
bitcoin's block explorer so

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,400
uh this is i've attached the link in

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,440
this presentation

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,520
uh but all of you can easily

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,599
access the bitcoin block explorer on

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,200
doing a simple google search

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,200
so i want all of you to actually take

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,440
some time take a couple of minutes

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,920
and actually go to the explorer itself

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,359
uh so you can just go to this link

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,319
blockchain.com

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,520
explorer or if you want i can i'll also

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:27,680
be taking you through

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:29,440
what you can see over here myself

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,200
basically you can see what are the

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,319
latest blocks that have been mined in

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,040
the network

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,480
so you know that 11 minutes ago a block

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,839
of a certain height

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,760
has been mined and this is the size of

00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:45,520
this block

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,119
uh you know all these number of bytes

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,800
so you can actually take a look at each

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,839
of these blocks so if you went go and

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,839
you press this block

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,960
you can see the hash value of this block

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,560
so i spoke a little bit more about

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,680
hashing functions right

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,599
so if you give the data on this block as

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,040
an input to a hashing function

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,440
this is the output you're going to get

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,800
so this is the hash

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,040
uh the timestamp for which this block

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,400
was mined is this

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,640
this is the block height and even though

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,720
it says the miner is unknown here

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,079
we don't know his physical identity but

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,480
we don't know his address in the

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,960
blockchain network so if you can see

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,680
the address of whoever actually mined

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,000
this block

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,359
in the bitcoin network but we don't know

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
it's physical identity that's another

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,280
problem

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,280
there's another property of facebook

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,319
there's another component or aspect of

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,440
traceability

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,839
that you can actually uh you know

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,839
completely dissociate the physical

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,920
identity from the

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,240
address of the miner from the from the

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,560
digital identity

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,920
and you have other parameters such as

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,960
the difficulty level

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,440
or the merkle root the version etc and

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,880
yeah so this is something that that that

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,720
these are certain parameters and

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,720
characteristics of the blockchain of

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
each

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,079
so uh the coin itself is different from

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,760
a block

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,800
so the coin is uh so so through mining

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,440
you actually mint and create new coins

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
so this block is actually very so it's

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,280
it's very

00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,680
hard to say what the i actually

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,760
it's not meaningful to say that this

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,880
block has any certain value

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,359
but it is basically the the the

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,000
coin that is produced on mining such

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,480
blocks

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,359
which have the value of like 60 000 usd

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,160
and all that

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,160
that you would mention

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,839
so this is the transaction volume so

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,839
basically in

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:15,839
bitcoin yeah so it is the notation for

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:15,839
bitcoin itself

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,839
yes that's perfect perfect exactly so

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,560
who minds this

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,599
block actually gets a fee reward so in

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,200
order to you know

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,960
uh incentivize the the mining of the

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,119
correct transactions

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,440
so he the the whoever mined this block

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,400
basically got 1.14 bitcoin

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,079
uh as a fee reward uh for for each of

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,079
the transactions that have been included

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,640
and the block reward that he gets is

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,599
6.25 bitcoin so for mining the block

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,119
itself

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,000
he got 6.25 bitcoin uh so so this is

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,880
basically

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,880
given in to thank him for you know

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,319
putting all this computational power

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,280
into finding uh you know uh the solution

00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,520
for a computation

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,480
complex mathematical problem so that is

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,720
a blocker board

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,720
and free rewards and transaction feed

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,560
about suppose that i want my transaction

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,720
to be included in this block right

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,560
now now if i i submit a transaction that

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,040
has been included in this block

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,960
uh i now give the miner 1.14 bitcoin

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,400
to say that thank you for including my

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,280
transaction into the block

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,160
here is 1.15 bitcoin that i give to you

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,160
as a reward for that

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:39,839
yes exactly exactly that's perfect

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,520
essentially every everything boils down

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,400
to buy and sell in the bit at least in

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,040
the bitcoin

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,640
uh protocol since the main design uh the

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,800
main design objective is to

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,200
facilitate these crypto transaction then

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,319
you can say yeah it is more of a

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,319
buying and selling type of

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,440
yes exactly so so so that is the time so

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,839
all the

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,800
transactions that has that have happened

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,839
so they have this

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,359
value of of of these many bitcoin and if

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,880
you would like to find the us dollar

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,240
equivalent just like how you did the

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,280
the conversion rate you can basically

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,800
find how much these transactions uh

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
what the transaction volume in terms of

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,839
us dollar is so exactly what you did was

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:48,400
exactly

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:50,400
like correct in your right

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,319
uh so we actually so this is the thing

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,359
about the bitcoin network is so

00:48:52,319 --> 00:49:02,000
due to about the supply and demand right

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:04,000
so so one thing that they do is

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,440
yeah so they don't have a cap and and

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,160
and to basically limit the supply of

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,280
bitcoin

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,000
uh so what is actually done is that

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,440
for every end like for a certain number

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,599
of blocks that have been mined

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,040
the blocked record now halves so

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,000
initially if i'm not drawn the block

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,440
reward was

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,359
25 and now that half to 12.5 another

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,520
half will happen to 6.25

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,880
so that is the uh you know the supply

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,000
and demand that you're probably

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,839
referring to

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,680
yeah so this is what you can see in the

00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,720
block explorer but if you go back and if

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,880
you so this is

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,240
the block itself now if you look at the

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,920
transactions right

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,599
the transaction also you can see so you

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,319
see one transaction just went through

00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,440
right now

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:50,640
uh there is two on at 2 27 am

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,520
uh say 2 27 pm singapore

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,559
uh you know time this this transaction

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,200
just went through

00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,720
uh the transaction was for these many

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,200
bitcoins

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,040
and you can see the dollar equivalent it

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,880
is written right next to it

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,319
and if you look at this you can

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,760
basically see the hash of this

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,000
transaction

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,800
and you can see the addresses so you can

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,760
see that

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,000
from this address to this address uh the

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,000
the

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:27,839
the transaction was facilitated

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,240
so this is the only uh proof that we can

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,960
get so if you see the status right it

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,559
still says

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,319
unconfirmed so it's not completely

00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,319
confirmed that this transaction has been

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,960
included and written in the blockchain

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,160
so this is a transaction request so once

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,000
the transaction has actually been

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,640
included in the blockchain and and

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
it has been recorded in the ledger then

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,400
you can see that there will be a status

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,930
change

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:58,599
from unconfirmed to confirmed

00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,599
[Applause]

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
okay

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,559
yeah basically

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,760
yes yes exactly exactly correct

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,760
so yeah so that is

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,720
so uh you can you can explore more about

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,400
this uh you know block explorer yourself

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:37,839
but yeah this is that point i was trying

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:41,760
to kind of make

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:44,240
yeah this is the link to the block

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,240
explorer

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,200
okay let me go back to my slides so now

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,000
let's talk a little bit more about

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,000
traceability

00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,359
so what are the issues that you face

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,280
when you speak about reasonability

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,680
uh so one of the problem with being

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,720
traceable is that there is a lack of

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,599
privacy

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,839
so uh i'm sure all of you are very

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,200
familiar with the pdpa classes and all

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,240
of those

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,240
so it basically makes it

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,720
impossible or even if you look at the

00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,920
general data protection regulation

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,520
so uh due to trace of like traceability

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,280
issues or privacy concerns

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,559
it would make it actually impossible to

00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,319
conduct full-fledged

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,559
business over the blockchain

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,680
so the second issue is time and so

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,760
privacy schemes

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,599
actually take much longer to commute

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,760
because to compute

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,880
and this actually impacts the usability

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,880
of the blockchain itself

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,240
we have uh main various solutions to

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,040
target these specific problems

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,040
uh such as homomorphic encryption uh but

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,839
yeah these two problems still exist and

00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:00,800
has not been completely 100

00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:03,040
addressed so uh now let's talk about why

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,640
we would like you know blockchain system

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,599
to be traceable

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,960
so if if privacy so basically now let's

00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,640
let's take a look at the two components

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,960
and see why these two components of

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,079
traceability is important

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,760
so if privacy is implemented

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,160
this could potentially give you better

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,000
control over personal data

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,839
and also one more key point is that

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,839
information that actually requires a

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,559
certain level of secrecy

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,079
or can actually be exchanged and

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,200
conducted and such data

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,920
can be written onto blockchain networks

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,599
there is a privacy uh aspect of

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,720
traceability

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,040
and the second aspect is

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,319
being able to attract the address on the

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,200
blockchain so

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,480
if if records are basically meant to be

00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,359
traceable

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,800
this could give a better audit trail for

00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,800
prominence now what is the meaning of

00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,559
audit trail for prominence

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,800
so basically it refers to the ability to

00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,079
be for of being able to track the

00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,760
origins of

00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:06,240
of of say anything so suppose you have

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,359
uh suppose like how how how this

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,319
translation of food

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,079
supply chain is that suppose you have in

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,559
the supermarket an avocado

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,839
that was mined at a certain you know

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,839
farm in cambodia

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,640
uh we give being being able to track

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,240
the origins would mean that you can

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,119
actually go back and see

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,720
exactly where this avocado came from so

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,000
where was this avocado that you're

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,240
eating

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,280
uh farmed and where was it actually

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,520
grown

00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
so that is the meaning of you know

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,559
making for a greater audit trade for

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,319
prominence

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,599
and and the second point that i'd like

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,640
to bring up here

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,559
is that it also provides a fine analysis

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,079
of the actions that have occurred over

00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,640
time by each peer

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,240
and thereby it also promotes a greater

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,640
sense of

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,880
like greater sense of transparency over

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,040
the entire network

00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,480
so that is another key point to keep in

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,680
mind on how

00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,680
being traceable actually

00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,839
severely impacts your network for the

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,839
good

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,680
and how do you make your transactions uh

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,160
traceable

00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,920
so your naive approach is for you to

00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,799
just put your name on the transaction

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,920
itself

00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,839
and for you to be traced to it so

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,160
in some contexts in some applications

00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:32,000
areas uh people actually prefer to take

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,240
this naive approach of traceability

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,200
but if you take a look at data science

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,599
and so

00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,559
uh so such as work on you know analyzing

00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,040
decentralized

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,280
exchanges uh makes it possible for

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,599
transactions to be traceable

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,040
now how do you ensure transactions are

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,040
untraceable

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,880
that's another aspect that we spoken

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,760
about right so now how do you ensure

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,520
that these trend

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,040
that your physical identity cannot be

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,559
tracked uh

00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,559
by just by submitting blockchain

00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,799
transactions so you have certain things

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,880
called zero knowledge proofs

00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,559
which let you prove that you know some

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,280
secret to another party without

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,680
revealing the secret itself

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,280
uh in my opinion zero knowledge proves

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,960
really really fascinating and

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,520
it's an old it's an entire field of

00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,000
study by itself it's really cool and fun

00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,160
to see

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,599
how these you know zero knowledge proves

00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,760
work but basically

00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,359
it allows another part it allows you to

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,680
prove to a certain party

00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:27,280
that you know some secret and or you

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,079
don't have to reveal the secret itself

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,839
in that process

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,839
so that is the meaning of zero knowledge

00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,079
now which application areas actually use

00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,440
traceability

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:42,799
so a key uh application area is the

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,599
is the application in the foods or not

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,200
only the food

00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,200
but more generally the supply chain

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,359
industry

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,000
so supply chains actually contain

00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:54,640
complex networks of suppliers

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,319
manufacturers you know distributors

00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,440
auditors retailers

00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,079
and many stakeholders and basically a

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,720
blockchain

00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:06,079
shared i.t infrastructure can actually

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:08,400
help streamline the entire workflow

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,319
of how you know these parties interact

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,680
and what the information flow

00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,520
throughout the supply chain would look

00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,040
like

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,720
a shared infrastructure would also

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,720
provide auditors with

00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,040
greater visibility into participants

00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,280
activities across the value chain

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,559
so this is another key application if

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,119
you talk about which applications

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,720
actually make

00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,480
use of traceability the key

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,799
word that pops up is the supply chain

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,480
industry

00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,720
and traceability also improves

00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,160
operational efficiency by mapping and

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:43,680
visualizing enterprise supply chains

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:46,480
so yeah so so that that that is what we

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,079
we can say when we reflect and think

00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,640
back about which applications areas

00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,640
actually used

00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,720
okay so that basically covers the

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,920
fundamental three key features of

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,480
blockchain

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,760
so just to you know take a quick recap

00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,520
so the three features are

00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,640
decentralization immutability and

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,880
traceability

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,280
and what makes a blockchain unique is

00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,440
that you have these three key features

00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,960
come together in a single system so that

00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,960
is the unique value proposition of

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,280
blockchain technology to have

00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,319
decentralization immutability

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,240
traceability

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,480
all three converging into a single

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,359
system and that is what gives blockchain

00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,319
technology

00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,079
uh the power that it has today so at

00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,559
this point in time i'd like to stop for

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:30,559
a quick

00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,839
break uh maybe a 10 to 15 minute break

00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,440
because there's been a lot of content

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,799
that we've covered right now

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,640
and it may take some time for you to

00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,960
process all of this and

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,559
uh so right now the time according to my

00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,440
system is 2 36

00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,440
so we will be back sharp at 2 46 and

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:51,839
continue to the next section

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,839
of this workshop thank you

01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:41,600
okay uh i hope all of you uh uh

01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,440
had a nice break and you know got a

01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,880
you know bottle of you know like a like

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,040
a gulp of water

01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,640
a breath of fresh air and all that so

01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,839
we'll be starting back our session

01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,159
and continuing the conversation and the

01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:55,120
uh

01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:56,640
workshop that we've been having and the

01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,920
next section i'd like to talk a little

01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,359
bit more about

01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:03,120
are the different blockchain protocols

01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,960
so i think everyone is very familiar

01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,920
with cloud services

01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,679
and and you know cloud technology

01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,319
cloud-based technology

01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,880
and so uh you all know there are various

01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,520
different

01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,239
cloud platforms that are out there like

01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,880
you have

01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,319
you know microsoft azure services you

01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,799
have the google cloud

01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,640
uh you have you know alibaba cloud

01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,159
alibaba has its own cloud platform

01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,960
and so you have all these different

01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:30,960
cloud platforms and similar to that

01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,040
you don't have a single blockchain but

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,799
we can have various different blockchain

01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,560
protocol

01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:38,319
now each of these blockchain protocols

01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,520
actually have a very specific design

01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,960
objective

01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:46,000
and uh your network type

01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,759
architecture is also in line with this

01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
design objective

01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,359
uh the three most common uh blocking

01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,719
protocols that we have and that we'd

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,960
like to talk about

01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,440
today are the bitcoin helium and

01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,920
hyperledger fabric protocol

01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,920
so the bitcoin protocol is probably the

01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,239
most famous blockchain protocol that

01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,239
almost everyone would have heard about

01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:09,360
so what is the bitcoin protocol

01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:11,679
so and what is the design objective

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,280
so bitcoin is actually devised and it

01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,880
was the first main application of

01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,640
blockchain technology

01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:22,080
and its basic objective was to allow

01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,480
cryptographic or cryptocurrency payments

01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,000
over a decentralized network so that is

01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,040
the main design objective

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,719
of the bitcoin protocol and so today we

01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,760
know that you know the price of bitcoin

01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,320
is like

01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,199
an all-time high of like 60 k us dollars

01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,760
and all that

01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:39,360
and uh so so bitcoin is starting to get

01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,280
a lot of traction

01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,040
but yeah basically in its origins if we

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,679
go and we think back about why bitcoin

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,360
was formed

01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,360
it was to allow crypto payment

01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,560
transactions over a decentralized

01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,199
account

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,840
so what is the network type of bitcoin

01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,760
so

01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,679
bitcoin network is actually a public and

01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,840
permissionless network

01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,280
so as the name suggests public and

01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,480
permissionless networks are those

01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,800
networks

01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,239
where anyone can join the network

01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,280
without needing permission

01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,960
from any anybody so suppose today you

01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,400
wanted to go and mine bitcoin of your

01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,920
own right

01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,520
uh no one is stopping you there are no

01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,120
barriers of anything and no one's going

01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,920
to stop you and no one's going to deny

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,920
you you're right

01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,920
similarly uh the second biggest

01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:25,360
cryptocurrency by market value is

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,960
ethiopia

01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,960
but if you take a look at ethereum and

01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,640
what is the main purpose that ethereum

01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,320
is trying to serve

01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,400
is that it is actually trying to provide

01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,520
a platform for developers to launch

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,840
their recently

01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,840
applications so it's not like bitcoin

01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,080
bitcoin is basically for crypto payments

01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,480
but

01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,480
ethereum was to do something different

01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,080
so they want to give you a platform

01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,080
to launch your decentralized

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:51,120
applications suppose

01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,320
uh like i basically spoke about the

01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,960
parallels between

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,719
a database in a blockchain right so

01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,800
you can essentially store and retrieve

01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,760
data from the blockchain so

01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,760
ethereum's main

01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,080
aim is to become the world's computer

01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,199
which means that it wants all its

01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,920
applications to be

01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:14,080
powered by the protocol where all these

01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,719
applications can basically store data

01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,760
and receive data for the ethereum so

01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,320
that is the

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,679
main design objective and the network

01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,840
type for ethereum

01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,679
is again public information less which

01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,120
means that tomorrow if i want to join an

01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,400
entire network and start building

01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,960
applications or

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,280
on the network or if you want to do so

01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,800
or no one's going to stop myself

01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,960
the third protocol i'd like to talk a

01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,080
little bit more about is the hyperledger

01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,360
fabric protocol

01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,560
so the design objective of this is quite

01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,280
similar to ethereum

01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,159
but the key word here that we are going

01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,840
to talk about

01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:49,199
is that these applications right these

01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,920
decentralized applications

01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:53,679
need to have focus on privacy so that is

01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,880
what matters so they have a focus

01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,800
on privacy so uh

01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,080
in line with the design objective the

01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,800
network type of the ep

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,719
as of the hyperledger fabric protocol

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,640
designed to be permission

01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,800
which means that only entities which are

01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,800
trusted by the organization

01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,880
can join the network it makes sense

01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,960
right suppose you have data

01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,719
that is you know somewhat confidential

01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,679
to only certain individuals within an

01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,159
organization

01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:21,760
which is only confidential to people who

01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,560
belong to their organization you don't

01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,960
want any

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,239
public entity to join the network and to

01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,320
be able to read

01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:30,480
you know such data and so that's why the

01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,760
hyperlink is happening

01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,560
rather than reading something you would

01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:37,840
not want them to basically have access

01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,400
or have the ability to separate

01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,040
transactions on the blockchain protocol

01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,640
themselves

01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,440
and so that is why the hyperledger

01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:48,320
protocol is actually permission

01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,000
uh since we are um like like most of us

01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,480
are actually based of singapore here i

01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
felt

01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,400
that there is a need to actually mention

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,800
another protocol that that has actually

01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,960
is up and coming which is known as the

01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,719
silica protocol silica is actually a

01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,560
project that was started

01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,199
in the national university of singapore

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,880
by a bunch of researchers and professors

01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,320
and and people across various

01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,280
disciplines and

01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,920
uh the silica network is actually up and

01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,280
running

01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,120
in live uh today

01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,120
so so that's another protocol that you

01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,960
can read more about but the main value

01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,120
proportionalization of silica

01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,679
is that they were the first network to

01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:28,560
implement sharding successfully

01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,960
and basically they used a byzantine

01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,560
fault tolerance approach to consensus

01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,000
rather than your standard proof of work

01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,960
proof of stake to

01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,400
increase your transaction speeds so

01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
these are the main blockchain protocols

01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,719
that are out there

01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,159
and i will leave it up to you to

01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,760
basically read a little bit more about

01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,760
the silica protocol itself

01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,040
but i think uh it is definitely

01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,640
important for you to know about it and

01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,480
take note of it because it's an up and

01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,239
coming protocol and it's been it's

01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,040
actually given a lot of traction

01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,040
throughout the years

01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,920
okay uh with that that basically

01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,800
concludes the section

01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,800
on uh

01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,600
the different blockchain protocols and

01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,000
now i'd like to talk a little bit more

01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,440
about

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,719
smart contracts so what are smart

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,960
contracts

01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,560
so behind every application

01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,880
decentralized application that

01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,560
is powered in the blockchain in the

01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,040
backend system you have

01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,640
these smart contracts which are deployed

01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,520
which basically

01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,840
are the building blocks of all these

01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,880
applications

01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,520
so what is a smart contract so a smart

01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,400
contract

01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,960
is actually a computer protocol which is

01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:42,080
intended to digitally facilitate

01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,320
verify or enforce the negotiations

01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,920
or performance of a contract there is a

01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:48,960
very you know official textbook

01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,120
definition of a smart contract

01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,960
so but what this essentially means is

01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:56,000
that suppose today

01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,880
person a and person b or you and me

01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,480
have some sort of a contract would like

01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,280
to draft a certain contract to say that

01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,400
okay

01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:07,520
if these certain you know

01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,280
criteria are met then this is what we

01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,000
are going to agree upon doing like like

01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,159
suppose if

01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,600
you have like a rental agreement right

01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:18,400
so you can say that

01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:21,679
if i become a tenant of your

01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,800
house i will pay your rental fees

01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:27,199
uh regularly at this

01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,080
on on this day every month and and this

01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,159
is the amount of

01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,360
uh rental charges that i'll pay you so

01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:35,280
so such contracts

01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:37,440
suppose we have such contracts so uh

01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,440
unlike traditional contracts smart

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,719
contracts actually

01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,719
allow for you know the automatic

01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,120
facilitation verification and

01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,960
enforcement of such negotiations

01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,520
and all of this is actually achieved

01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,000
through a computer protocol

01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,600
so how this happens is that once you

01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,360
know certain terms of the contracts have

01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,880
been fulfilled by the parties

01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,440
the smart contracts will actually

01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,600
self-execute

01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,280
so which means that the clauses and the

01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,719
data of the smart contract

01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,400
will actually have to be digitally

01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,239
programmed and fed

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,920
into the blockchain by a trusted third

01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,920
party which is known as an oracle

01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,159
so if we take a look at how these smart

01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,679
contracts work this is basically these

01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:23,120
are basically four steps

01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,040
involved in in in you know execution of

01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,199
a smartphone

01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,920
so the first step is for a contract to

01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:32,000
be written as a code into the blockchain

01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,880
where you have to specifically

01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,800
hard code and encode the various clauses

01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,760
and data

01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,920
so an event which can basically be in

01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,480
the form of say a delivery of a good

01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,480
or an expiration date or any event can

01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:50,080
basically trigger the smart contract

01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,520
and the execution of the code of the

01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,760
terms and conditions that have been

01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,000
encoded to the contract will now happen

01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,760
automatically

01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,199
and so when this is done the assets are

01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,920
basically released to the necessary

01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,800
parties

01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,360
if the contract involves uh certain

01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,440
financial transactions to take place

01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,280
and finally regulators can study the

01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,280
immutable transaction required

01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,280
and understand all the activity that has

01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,280
been taken that has taken place

01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,280
and has been recorded into the stanford

01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,880
proof uh distributed blockchain system

01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,480
now the beauty of the decentralized

01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,600
nature of blockchain

01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:28,560
uh allows that allow the smart contract

01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,800
to actually bypass the middle man and so

01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,040
the

01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,520
so so now so traditionally we see that

01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,600
the enforcement of contracts heavily

01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,640
depend on a million man

01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,000
so if you look at you know uh various

01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,800
contracts that that

01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,840
that that have that you know that that

01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,320
we can think of

01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,840
you know various examples of contracts

01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,800
and agreements that made these parties

01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,719
have come to

01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,960
we see that they are generally

01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,840
individuals or institutions

01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,400
such as banks and solid sitters which

01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,600
actually are required to facilitate

01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,120
uh the binding the these binding

01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,520
contracts in a legal manner

01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,199
so it actually requires a middleman but

01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,600
these smart contracts right

01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:11,040
you can see in these steps you actually

01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,640
don't need any middle man and you can

01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,239
completely bypass the middle man in this

01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,960
entire process

01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:19,280
so now why is this important uh this is

01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,640
important because

01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,400
generally having a middleman enforce

01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,159
you know the terms of the contract would

01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:29,040
basically mean that

01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:30,239
the the contact will take a longer time

01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,159
to execute

01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,000
and more importantly this middleman can

01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:35,199
basically be biased towards a certain

01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,880
party

01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,640
but let's talk a little bit more in

01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,120
detail of the benefits of these smart

01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:44,000
contracts

01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,960
so these smart contracts in a nutshell

01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,960
have

01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:52,239
the benefits of autonomy security

01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:56,880
faster speeds increased accuracy

01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:56,880
cost saving trust and backup

01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:02,640
so what are the benefit of smart

01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,640
contracts if you look at autonomy

01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:08,239
so the decentralized nature of these

01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,239
blockchain contracts

01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:14,000
uh and me so so

01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,760
basically help you fight free from the

01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,719
middle man and fight free from

01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,800
centralized

01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:19,840
institutions and that is how you gain

01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,800
autonomy

01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,800
through smart contract

01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:27,600
smart contacts are more secure because

01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,679
blockchain

01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,880
because blockchain systems are

01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:34,080
tamper-proof

01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,280
and are unalterable so these ledgers are

01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,520
completely 100

01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,280
tamper proof and so this it also

01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,239
provides a definitive proof of all the

01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,920
transactions

01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,520
that have actually been recorded and

01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,960
that have been taken place using the

01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,239
letter

01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,080
so it also relies heavily on encryption

01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,360
and so this essentially creates an

01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,719
ecosystem

01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:57,520
uh that facilitates very secure

01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,239
peer-to-peer transactions so that is a

01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,159
key benefit

01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:02,159
of smart contracts more secure

01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:08,800
another key benefit of smart contracts

01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,880
is that it allows for faster speeds

01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,800
so when you completely bypass a middle

01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,639
man right you basically reduce on the

01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:18,320
time that is wasted

01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:20,320
in you know having the contract uh

01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,400
verified or having the terms of the

01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,719
contract verified by another party

01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,480
so suppose you have a court date to

01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,239
basically say that okay

01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,760
this person has defaulted from the

01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,840
agreement that we have reached

01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,280
when we sign this contract uh you can

01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,760
have a coordinate which is set

01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,440
months after you file the complaint

01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,000
years after you file a complete in some

01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,480
cases

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,040
and so a lot of time is actually wasted

01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,800
so

01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,320
a smart contract allows for faster

01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,920
speeds and and then

01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:50,960
by bypassing the middle man you actually

01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:53,760
prevent the wasting of a lot of time

01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,760
it also allows for increased accuracies

01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,440
as humans tend to make mistakes and

01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,760
humans tend to be biased

01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,760
so when you have a human middle man like

01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,360
it is quite common that he may be biased

01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,000
he may make some mistake

01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,880
and so because of which the contract

01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,120
cannot be

01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,000
you know enforced correctly but through

01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,960
increase

01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,679
with accuracy and smart contracts you

01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,239
can basically

01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:18,719
ensure that the contracts are executed

01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,719
perfectly

01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,400
smart contracts also help save a lot of

01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,480
cost

01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,440
and it also increases trust in the

01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,719
network

01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:32,080
as unloadable ledgers mean transactions

01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:34,400
are essentially set in stone

01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,760
and also one more benefit about smart

01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,960
contracts are since they are based on

01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,639
the blockchain

01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,719
you have effectively a backup

01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,760
so data storage devices can basically

01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,760
fail

01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,280
and you have what is known as a single

01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,600
point of failure problem

01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,440
is exactly what the blockchain

01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,239
technology tries to

01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:55,840
eliminate completely but however smart

01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:58,639
contracts actually typically

01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,320
do duplicate all transaction so that all

01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,600
parties have a record of all the

01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,080
transactions that have been

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,120
you know submitted so the likelihood of

01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,080
all

01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,440
parties having to suffer you know data

01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,600
storage failures

01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,679
is practically zero or practically

01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,360
non-existent

01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,040
so these are the main benefits of smart

01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,880
contract

01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,719
but if you really take a step back and

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,080
reflect on all the benefits that are

01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,840
just listed down

01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,760
you'll realize something you'll actually

01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,000
realize that all these benefits

01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,760
and all these application areas are

01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,520
based on the three key properties that

01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,679
we've spoken about there is immutability

01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:37,199
traceability and decentralization

01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:38,080
all the advantages and so yeah so like i

01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,679
said that is the

01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,360
the having three properties come

01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,760
together in a common platform

01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:49,840
is the main unique value proposition for

01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,840
blockchain itself

01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,600
now let's talk a little bit more about

01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,600
the limitation to smart contracts

01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,960
the main limitation that i'd like to

01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,520
shed some light upon

01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:04,400
is the legal justifications in the

01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,639
enforceability

01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:09,120
so traditionally right so the

01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:11,920
establishment of a valid contract

01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:14,159
covers various constructs such as

01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:17,360
offered by one party or parties

01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:21,679
acceptance by the other party or parties

01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:24,800
a promise some sort of a consideration

01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:28,840
and also uh

01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:30,800
legal capacity mutuality in some

01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,560
contracts

01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,400
so some elements are actually not

01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,719
applicable to smart contracts

01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,920
and therefore regulations actually need

01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,040
to come up with

01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:43,199
a new set of enforcements that can prove

01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,480
smart contracts to be valid so that is

01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:46,000
the main problem

01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,600
that we face with smart contact so

01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,480
there's legal justifications and

01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,480
enforceability

01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:54,400
there's actually a paper that i'd like

01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:57,120
you all to read a little bit more about

01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,120
let me just quickly

01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,800
give you the link for this paper itself

01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,920
it's it's it's again on

01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,840
uh smart contracts and and

01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,199
the implementations of the applications

01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,600
and all that and

01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:11,120
uh i covered most of the content

01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,960
actually comes from this paper

01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,480
but i'd like all of you to also try and

01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,239
cover the content

01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,679
and then read a little bit more on your

01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:20,880
free tab

01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:27,840
so let me just add the link to that uh

01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:27,840
you know paper right here

01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:42,239
you have all received a link right now

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,800
so that's again something that you can

01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,560
keep in mind and and a paper that you

01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,000
can kind of explore on your own

01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:54,639
so that is basically an introduction to

01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,280
smart contracts

01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,760
uh so let me now take take some time to

01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,760
talk

01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,760
about blockchain decision models

01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,239
uh but before that uh i realized there's

01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,760
a section on smart contract that i've

01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,960
forgotten to cover and i'd like to cover

01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,480
a little bit more about

01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,320
which is basically the application of

01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,760
smart contracts

01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,760
so i'll basically be talking about the

01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,120
application of smart contracts in three

01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,120
key industries

01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,400
this is the financial industry

01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,440
healthcare industry

01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,120
and the music industry so

01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,800
uh the first one is of course the

01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,280
finance industry

01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,199
so smart contracts are actually gaining

01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,080
the most transaction in the finance

01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:34,560
industry

01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,000
and many financial interes in adult

01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,719
institutions are actually trying to

01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,800
adopt blockchain and smart contracts to

01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:45,280
simplify and digitize the entire process

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,440
so some examples that actually uh that i

01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:50,239
can think of maybe at the top of my head

01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,440
is to do with this this bank ubs so it's

01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:53,199
actually recently

01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,880
you know adopted the use of blockchain

01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,880
and smart contracts

01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,400
to create some sort of a self-paying

01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,239
instrument

01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,679
and this self-paying instrument is

01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:04,719
designed in such a way

01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:07,120
uh that will be entirely risk free and

01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,360
it is an available payment stream for

01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,679
unbanked people

01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,960
so there is a key application area of

01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,000
smart contract that is financial

01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,760
industry

01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,880
and actually these kind of micro

01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,639
contracts can actually allow

01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,000
for what is known as microfinancing in

01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,679
the finance industry

01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,440
and this this can basically give the

01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,800
ability for every common man

01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,800
to pay for everyday goods

01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,120
an application area of smart contacts in

01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:35,520
the healthcare industry

01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,760
basically tries and targets the various

01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,159
problems the industry faces

01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:43,040
in terms of data conservation and

01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:43,040
patient privacy

01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:49,199
so when you have a smart contract

01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,440
the middleman can essentially be

01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:54,960
completely eliminated

01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:56,239
so if if we take a look at a specific

01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,719
example

01:27:56,239 --> 01:28:00,960
uh so earlier this year i was reading a

01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:03,920
little bit more about

01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,960
uh this this decentralized application

01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,520
called

01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,199
uh application if i'm not wrong yeah

01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,199
application should be its name yeah

01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:12,719
so application basically is a blockchain

01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,960
development application

01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,960
uh which was basically powered entirely

01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,440
through smart contracts

01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,159
and the main thing that this application

01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,120
aims to do

01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:24,159
is that it aims to foster data integrity

01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,560
transparency

01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:27,199
and secure record of patients data

01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,040
health

01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,239
so that that is basically what they were

01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,840
trying to do and

01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:33,920
and that is the purpose that this

01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,600
application tries to solve

01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,120
uh this is another glimpse into what how

01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,880
smart contracts can be used

01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,560
in another industry specifically the

01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,000
healthcare industry

01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,840
and finally let's talk a little bit more

01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,840
about its use case in the music industry

01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:52,480
so earlier this year i was leading or

01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,120
another last year i was reading more

01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,520
about

01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:57,920
a music streaming platform which

01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,560
actually decentralizes revenue

01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,080
and has a proper allocation of revenue

01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,120
of revenue streams

01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:08,080
to respective artists

01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:09,600
so one of the key uh problems and key

01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,760
challenges in the music industry is

01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,360
plagued with today

01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:17,520
is that revenues actually fail to reach

01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,199
the content creators and this is

01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,000
entirely due to centralization

01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:23,199
so suppose you have various agents and

01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,840
you have lot of

01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,840
you know like like

01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,719
so suppose i'm i'm say like a guitarist

01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,719
or like a musician who would like to

01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,159
you know release uh you know a record

01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,679
album or would like to release some

01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,440
songs to the public

01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,880
i would have to go through an agent to

01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,960
actually do so

01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,920
and because of this middle man there is

01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,320
an entire lack of transparency

01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,360
and uh this transparency is actually a

01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,679
dispute over ownership of content

01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,880
and so it also there's also very very

01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,679
little visibility

01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,679
uh on the rev on the royalties payment

01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,600
and so essentially the

01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,960
all the process that happened pertaining

01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,920
to uh you know

01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,480
tran like like payments and fulfillments

01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:08,000
of

01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:11,040
you know obligations on on unlike

01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,960
uh royalty payment and revenue

01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:15,840
payment and all of that is done so in a

01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,719
very siloed manner in a very

01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,639
not open to public a very opaque

01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,320
platform so the transparency is what is

01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,760
missing

01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:26,239
and so through the help of smart

01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,560
contracts what you can essentially do

01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:29,440
is that you can allow the validation of

01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,360
the ownership

01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,080
of a song to happen through a

01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:36,880
transparent tagging system

01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:39,040
so what this implies is that the party

01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,120
who creates the tracks

01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:43,280
can get the right portion of fees

01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:46,320
allocated from royalties

01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,320
by releasing the track

01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,159
yeah so this is some of the very few

01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,400
examples

01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:53,760
of the real world challenges in the real

01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,960
world

01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,480
the problems that these industries and

01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,560
these businesses have faced

01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:02,000
which can actually be completely solved

01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,360
through smart contracts

01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,800
and through blockchain technology

01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,719
i'm sure there are a lot more examples

01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:12,239
that you can find if you

01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,960
uh if you go and you do a simple google

01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:15,040
search

01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,880
if you read the paper that i linked

01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,080
previously but these are some of this

01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,480
just a glimpse into the

01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,000
potential of smart contacts and just how

01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,440
powerful they can be used

01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,159
how powerfully they can be used in the

01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,159
industry today

01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,600
okay now let's talk about blockchain

01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:32,639
decision models

01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,159
so let's take a step back and see

01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,679
exactly everything that we've covered

01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:39,120
and go over the recap of what we've done

01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,880
so first you've actually spoken about

01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:43,280
the three three key properties of

01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,840
blockchain technology that is

01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:49,920
decentralization

01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,920
so that was part one of the workshop

01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,199
and the part two of this workshop

01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,880
was basically talking about smart

01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:05,040
contracts

01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,440
and that is uh in various blockchain

01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,440
protocols

01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,280
and now we are reaching the final

01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,040
section

01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,560
and probably the most interesting

01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,199
section of the workshop

01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,639
and that section is how to use

01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,080
blockchain and how to come up with

01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,239
blockchain solutions

01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,120
and also examples of various blockchain

01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,719
solutions so this

01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:28,159
is the more business aspect of

01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,520
blockchain and

01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:31,199
now we're actually going to look at some

01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,520
case studies some use cases

01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,639
and see when will you use blockchain

01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,159
solutions

01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:37,520
and what are some of the examples of

01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,639
blockchain solutions that are being

01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,159
deployed

01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,840
today in the industry so before we

01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,280
actually talk about the case studies and

01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,040
some use cases

01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,960
we need to talk a little bit more about

01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,560
blockchain decision models

01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,480
so this model that you see in your

01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,000
screen right here is a decision model

01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:58,880
that has been devised by ibm

01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,560
so what is a decision model uh so a

01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,360
decision model is actually a formal

01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,480
system

01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:08,639
which is used for perceiving organizing

01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:11,920
and managing the entire business logic

01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:15,760
and these business logics are other

01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:19,040
are basically the

01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:22,800
why of why you make certain resolution

01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:25,840
so so this is underlying uh

01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,840
the underlying logic behind why

01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,320
a certain organization would like to

01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,480
make this advantage

01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,679
so this is the ibm model like i

01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,080
mentioned and now

01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,800
we basically break down this model to

01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,040
actually

01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,400
evaluate whether or not you should use a

01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,239
blockchain solution

01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:44,480
for a particular problem that you are

01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:46,560
seizing

01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,480
so this this this this one is actually

01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,000
quite big so you have various inputs

01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,520
you have to answer various questions say

01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,199
yes no yes no yes no

01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,040
and you will finally come to a final

01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,560
state of guess you should use blockchain

01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,480
or no you should consider your

01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:01,280
approaches uh this is a little

01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:02,159
hard to keep track of but it can

01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,360
basically

01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:08,480
the entire model can boil down to these

01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:11,199
three key ideas

01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,800
so the three key ideas that this model

01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,719
tries to encapsulate

01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,800
is that a blockchain would be a possible

01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:20,639
solution for a problem

01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:23,840
that is number one involving

01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:26,080
contractual agreements and complex

01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:29,840
business logics

01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,840
so if you look here right

01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:34,080
look at all the questions that it asks

01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:35,520
one thing that you can basically see

01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,719
throughout all one thing that is

01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,159
consistent that you can see throughout

01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,719
all the questions that is asked

01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:42,080
is that it basically tries to identify

01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,920
whether you involve

01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,320
contractual agreements and whether you

01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,639
make use of complex business logics

01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,600
and so why will blockchain solution be a

01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,920
proper

01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,000
uh you know or rather a perfect solution

01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,080
to solve such problems

01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
is that the property of immutability of

01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,560
blockchain comes in handy

01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,560
to basically ensure that contracts and

01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,760
other legal documents are entirely

01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,280
tampered with

01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,040
so through smart contracts and

01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,360
immutability of the blockchain

01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,880
you know that these contracts that you

01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,320
basically use

01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,560
and these agreements that you come up

01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,080
with and these legal documents

01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,960
that are associated with them are

01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,960
completely targeted

01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:22,880
and these contracts essentially provide

01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,880
more security when compared to

01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,040
traditional contract laws

01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,199
and it also reduces the transactional

01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,400
costs associated with contracting

01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,320
because today if i want to go and

01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,320
drastically craft a contract

01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,600
uh and and you know get the legal

01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,880
structure in place

01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,719
and then and then get it formally

01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,480
verified and all that and then you know

01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:42,560
go through the formal drafting process

01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:46,080
i'm going to spend a lot of money

01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:48,080
and all this money uh is is

01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,320
so this is a potential opportunity to

01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,679
save costs in organizations so

01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,760
another organization suppose they can

01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,600
use smart contracts she can effectively

01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,000
get the job done for a lesser cost

01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,679
it is definitely much preferred uh you

01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,760
know over

01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,239
your your traditional solutions that

01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,239
that basically

01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:09,520
uh the second point that this model

01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,159
thrives and encapsulates

01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,000
is that suppose you require your

01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:16,239
transaction to be private so you can ask

01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,760
cvtc here

01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:20,080
like they ask for if you need your you

01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:23,280
need to keep your transactions right

01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,800
uh so yeah so suppose your

01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,560
problem requires you to keep your

01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,040
transactions private

01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,119
then blockchain solutions are perfect

01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,560
and buyer blockchain solutions perfect

01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:35,280
is because of the key property of

01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,679
tradability that we spoke about before

01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:39,840
so the property of traceability and the

01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,880
privacy that is associated with it

01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,880
allows you to keep your addresses

01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,320
in your blockchain network completely

01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,040
separate from any physical

01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:50,400
identity so you so any physical identity

01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,040
cannot be traced back

01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,040
or from your

01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:01,360
blockchain solutions can be perfect for

01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:05,440
problems that require your transactions

01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:07,679
to be private and

01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,360
another question uh that this model

01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,760
basically asks you

01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,400
and and this bond will deals with is

01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,800
whether your

01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,800
your problem requires a market approach

01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,560
so if your problem does require a market

01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,400
approach

01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,639
so this point can basically be broken

01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,679
down and you can consider three other

01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,440
factors

01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,040
before actually deciding to adopt a

01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:32,080
blockchain solution

01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:34,639
and what are these three other factors

01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:36,000
first factor whether the potential use

01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,000
case requires greater

01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,920
than two parties or more than two

01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,080
parties to collaborate

01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,320
if the answer is yes then a blockchain

01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:47,119
solution can definitely come in handy

01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,440
since decentralized networks essentially

01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,840
give

01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:51,760
participants the flexibility to create

01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,239
your own customized solutions

01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,920
using proprietary logic while still

01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:58,560
keeping it running in a common

01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:02,480
distributed ledger

01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:05,760
that is one factor the second factor

01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:08,320
does your potential a doctor

01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,960
want to lower his costs if the answer is

01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,480
yes

01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,560
then once again a blockchain solution

01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:14,239
comes in handy

01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,400
this is because deploying a blockchain

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:18,880
solution can help reduce a lot of

01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:21,199
overhead expenditure and this can

01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,719
significantly lower transaction costs

01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,800
since cryptocurrency payments are

01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:27,600
handled in a peer-to-peer network

01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:29,040
without any centralized property so this

01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,400
basically translates into lower

01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,760
merchandising

01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,679
and this is essentially what i spoke

01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,679
about a little earlier also

01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,199
but i think it's more appropriate to

01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,440
mention that point here

01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:42,719
when we talk about your solution

01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,719
requiring a market approach

01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:47,280
and the third point is rather it is

01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,840
important

01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,840
that discoverability is improved so if

01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,920
your problem is such a problem that you

01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:57,040
would like to improve discoverability

01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,400
then yes blockchain is perfect so this

01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,480
can essentially be done

01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,719
through a solution that makes its use of

01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,520
blocking technology since every peer in

01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,560
the recent

01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,080
network has access to the same ledger

01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,760
so it's not that i have a different copy

01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,639
of the ledger you have a different copy

01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,280
of the letter but

01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:14,159
everyone has a copy of the same ledger

01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,119
and it is very

01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:18,960
easy to broadcast an intention to

01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:22,159
basically submit a transaction

01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:26,480
or to retrieve data from a transaction

01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:26,480
so that is basically what ibm suggests

01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:41,040
it's not too difficult but yeah i've

01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,119
kind of broken it down and basically

01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,520
explained the key points that this

01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:45,520
implies

01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,159
okay so now that we know

01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:54,080
how to evaluate whether or not we should

01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:55,040
use a blockchain solution for a given

01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,920
problem

01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,920
it is time for us to actually look at

01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,840
various solutions

01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:05,520
and various problems that are being

01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:07,280
solved by blockchain today

01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,280
so i think i have a lot of time in my

01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:12,239
hands actually

01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:13,679
this is still 318 and i just have two

01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:16,239
more slides to cover

01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:18,080
and just do more case studies to analyze

01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:20,000
on various blockchain use cases

01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,159
uh so whatever time is remaining i will

01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,679
basically open the floor up to q a

01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:25,600
or where you can ask me any questions

01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,199
that you have in the session and we can

01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:31,199
basically have a free flow

01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:33,440
conversation so now let's take a look at

01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,960
various blockchain use cases but before

01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,360
proceeding i'd like to again

01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,880
ask you if any of you have any questions

01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,880
that you'd like to ask me

01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,280
uh if so then now's the best time to

01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,280
pick it up

01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:52,480
yeah probably give it another few

01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,040
minutes i hope all of you are able to

01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,639
follow

01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:56,400
uh if all of you are able to follow can

01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:57,040
you can you please give me raise your

01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,679
hand

01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,600
uh so that i know that that that you

01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:06,159
know that i'm not just speaking

01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,159
uh to a wall and

01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,880
wonderful okay i'm getting some

01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,880
responses

01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:19,840
that's great

01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,600
okay so i think if everything is good

01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:25,600
then let me move on to the next sections

01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,960
of this workshop

01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,480
okay now we're gonna specifically study

01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,800
two case studies

01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,920
and uh both of these are blockchain

01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,560
projects

01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,199
and and and the first one the first use

01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,719
case that we'll

01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,880
be studying is the use case in the

01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:42,000
supply chain industry and we'll be doing

01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,199
so by looking

01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,520
at an example of a startup called demuto

01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:49,440
which basically leverages on blockchain

01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,840
technology to provide solutions

01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,119
uh for food traceability in the entire

01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:56,560
supply chain

01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:59,199
and then we'd be going over a case study

01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,400
on how blockchain can be used to verify

01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:03,280
to provide

01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:05,199
tamper-proof certificates and we'll be

01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,719
looking at a project called open search

01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:10,880
which is being spearheaded

01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:13,920
here in singapore to kind of do so

01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:15,520
so let me so before i play the video let

01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,440
me just make sure that i'm sharing my

01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,880
screen with audio enabled so let me just

01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,880
restart resharing my screen

01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:29,199
yeah so you are you should not be able

01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:32,000
to see my screen

01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:33,360
and hear any audio that i play also so

01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,320
let's let's have a look at the first

01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,400
case study

01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:39,840
there is the case study in supply chain

01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,840
or by looking at a startup

01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,840
demuto

01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:57,840
[Music]

01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,840
both of us

01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:13,199
sustainability inability about 600

01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,520
million people

01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,520
you know

01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:20,239
and i've reached four hundred and three

01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,400
hundred dollars

01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:25,840
now the number on the number of ways is

01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,840
even more

01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,840
hi my name is

01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,840
is

01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,880
so when you receive

01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:11,039
[Music]

01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:22,080
and this is where the blue boxing

01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,000
technology really comes in where the

01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:26,560
custody of truth is

01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,760
providing our environmental abilities to

01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,800
a database

01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,000
where everyone can share them and

01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,960
when we are able to share this

01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,960
information we

01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,840
is

01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,360
and this is the iot device which we call

01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,360
deck

01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,400
and this and the digital information

01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:09,840
that is captured

01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:12,800
captures all now organized as well

01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:15,920
with the fluids and the cutting board we

01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,920
now can associated

01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,840
is

01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:48,400
and it's more importantly importantly

01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,400
allowing the geographies

01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:59,840
but what most important is

01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,960
and this would then

01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,920
[Music]

01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,360
glory

01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,840
and fighting because

01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,880
one of

01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,840
is

01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:05,840
now what we have done

01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,869
[Music]

01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:33,840
innovate develop solutions

01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:37,560
[Music]

01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:46,159
okay so i hope you all enjoyed the video

01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,760
that it displayed

01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:49,199
i found it to be quite informative the

01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:52,239
first time i saw it

01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:53,600
and basically it took some life into the

01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:55,280
challenges that the supply chain

01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,440
industry faces

01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,719
and how blockchain solutions can

01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,840
actually be used

01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:03,679
to overcome these challenges uh so let's

01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,520
actually take a step back and analyze

01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,920
this video a little bit more

01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,520
and actually see what are some of the

01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,880
key information

01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:15,920
that we can derive from this video

01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:18,560
so uh for this case and in the next

01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,280
basically i'll talk about four things

01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,400
firstly

01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:24,719
the problem that this industry faces

01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,159
secondly the current solutions that have

01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,719
been set in place

01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:30,719
to overcome these challenges the third

01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:31,280
thing would be about the problems with

01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,080
this

01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,040
these current solutions and why

01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,760
blockchain will do

01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:39,760
a much better job and finally i'll talk

01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,560
about the challenges of implementation

01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,719
of a blockchain solution to target each

01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:47,840
of these problems

01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:50,880
so let's start with the first one so the

01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:53,920
the overlying theme of this video

01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:56,639
was food safety and regulation

01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,920
so what is the problem so the problem is

01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:00,880
that the food is

01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,159
food safety is actually a very growing

01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,360
concern

01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:08,480
among various consumers and regulators

01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:10,239
so uh if you listen closely to the video

01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,760
so the person had actually given some

01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:13,440
statistics and so

01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,280
on doing some google search and then

01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,800
doing some analysis i found out

01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,119
that according to the world health

01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,599
organization there was an estimated

01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:23,360
number

01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:25,599
of 420 000 people who died

01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:27,599
in just one year as a result of food

01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:29,440
contamination

01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,040
so what this effectively means is that

01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:33,679
everywhere in the world

01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:34,159
every one in ten individuals are

01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:37,040
actually

01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:40,000
victims of face fatalities due to food

01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:41,599
borne in illnesses

01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
so this is actually a very very growing

01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,560
concern because 420 000 is not a small

01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,320
number

01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,159
it is definitely a very very uh

01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:52,080
significant enough number for us to

01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:54,800
consider this a large scale problem

01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:56,639
another uh part of this problem was that

01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,920
food safety breaches

01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:02,400
also resulted in close to one one zero

01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,599
million dollars or so if not millions

01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,320
billion dollars

01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,360
which have been lost annually because of

01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:10,880
the wastage of

01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:13,040
close to 1.3 billion tons of food

01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,719
this is a crazy high amount amount and

01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,000
and definitely this problem

01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:17,760
is something that really needs to be

01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,880
solved and something that the supply

01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,599
chain

01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,000
a solution and solution to this problem

01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,840
will

01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,599
largely benefit the entire supply chain

01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,800
industry

01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:28,880
so if we take a look at the current

01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,599
solutions the non-blockchain solutions

01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,159
which have been

01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,719
you know put in place so the main

01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,800
solutions revolve around regulators

01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:38,639
the united states and other countries

01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,920
who have worked towards improving food

01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:43,119
safety measures

01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:45,920
by in by implementing various acts such

01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:48,639
as the food safety and modernization act

01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,520
and what these acts basically try and do

01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:52,239
is that they

01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:54,239
try to increase control and preventive

01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:55,920
measures on food imports and they

01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,599
basically impose preventive measures and

01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,159
food imports

01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,280
so there is the solution that that you

01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:04,480
know that's currently there

01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:06,639
that just try to improve regulation and

01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,960
increase the control that you have on

01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:11,040
approving food inputs

01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,960
now what is the current problem what are

01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:15,520
the problems with the current solution

01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,080
why isn't this solution comprehensive

01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,280
enough

01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:23,280
to completely solve the problem

01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:26,960
so while placing regulations is

01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:29,119
like well it does try and solve the

01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:33,119
problem to some extent

01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:36,320
uh but it's not attacking the problem

01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:37,040
and then the main pain point that that

01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,719
give it

01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,639
that an ideal solution would try and

01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:43,040
address the main pain point that an

01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:45,119
ideal solution would try and address

01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:46,080
is the lack of transparency and

01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:48,719
traceability

01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,159
in the entire food supply chain so this

01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:52,239
is the key paid point

01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:53,199
and unfortunately just placing

01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:56,840
regulations

01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:58,080
is not targeting this pain point in any

01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:00,080
way

01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,599
so despite having a highly regulated

01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:04,480
system there are still

01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:06,320
large chances of contaminated food

01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:09,440
entering the supply chain

01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:12,080
and in order to prevent any breakout and

01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:13,760
prevent these four twenty 000 deaths due

01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:16,400
to foodborne illnesses

01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:18,560
it is very very essential to pinpoint

01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:20,400
the exact source of contamination

01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,599
and that is exactly what an ideal

01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:23,599
solution would try and do

01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:29,280
so now let us enter blockchain and

01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:32,159
and and talk about why blockchain might

01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:34,239
be a potential solution for this problem

01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:35,599
so traceability is one of the key

01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:36,880
features of blockchain technology as

01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:38,960
we've spoken about

01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:41,920
and it also enables it to be a perfect

01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,840
solution for the current problem

01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,360
how exactly is traceability going to

01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,159
allow us to solve this problem

01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:50,239
so basically it will enable us to have

01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:51,840
the ability to quickly pinpoint the

01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:54,239
source of contamination

01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:55,040
and it basically gives us the ability to

01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:58,080
fight

01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,920
against these food on plates uh

01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:02,000
fraud prevention is also another added

01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,920
benefit that

01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,920
treats ability and blockchain brings

01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,199
together

01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,960
what are some of the challenges of

01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:10,560
implementation of a blockchain solution

01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,760
in such a context

01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:16,480
so the key problem that

01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,199
you know blockchain solution faces uh in

01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,520
today's

01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:21,280
you know work in today's world when we

01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:24,080
look at implementation

01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:25,119
is the challenge of block the blockchain

01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:28,320
system being

01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:29,119
as reliable on only as much as the data

01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,599
that goes

01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:32,960
into it so so the reliability of the

01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,760
data that goes into the blockchain

01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,840
solution

01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,920
entirely determines how reliable a

01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,880
blockchain solution actually is

01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,880
this is commonly known to the common man

01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,040
as the garbage in garbage

01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,880
problem where if your data that has

01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:51,119
actually been stored on the blockchain

01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:53,199
is not you know it it is not

01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:54,719
true or or there are problems with the

01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:55,599
data that is being stored in the

01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:57,280
blockchain

01:54:55,599 --> 01:55:00,880
so that is going to translate into

01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:03,119
problems on the solution as a whole

01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,639
if you put garbage into the blockchain

01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:06,080
when you try and retrieve

01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:07,679
data from the blockchain all you're

01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:08,719
going to get is garbage that is the

01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:12,000
garbage and garbage

01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,599
problem so uh the

01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,040
blockchains you key unique value

01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:17,520
proposition of creating an

01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,320
imputable record of transactions that

01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,239
can only be

01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,840
changed with consensus of other parties

01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:26,080
in the network

01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:28,560
is only as good it is only effective

01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,840
if you can ensure that the data that is

01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,639
attached to the packet

01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,199
of say long guns in a grocery store is

01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,780
actually

01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:37,599
accurate and in in is perfect

01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:40,080
[Music]

01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:43,360
the perfect person recording this data

01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,360
doesn't make any mistake

01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,119
so that is the key challenge of

01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,960
implementation when we talk about

01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:50,320
a blockchain solution for the supply

01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,560
chain industry

01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:53,760
let's now move on to the second use case

01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,000
and second case study

01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,960
that is on how blockchain solutions can

01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,239
be used

01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:00,880
to create uh blockchain solutions can be

01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:06,960
used

01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:06,960
to create a verifiable certification

01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,639
and for this i'll be playing a video

01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:18,560
on open source which is a blockchain

01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:29,840
project uh that has been driven

01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:29,840
in singapore right here

01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:42,400
receiving numerous skill associations

01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:46,199
[Music]

01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:05,199
[Music]

01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:06,920
this digital submission will also be

01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:11,840
automatically loaded

01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:11,840
skills on his mind skills

01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:25,119
now when an employer

01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,880
when the employer receives the digital

01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:38,880
search he opens a browser

01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,880
and goes to the ghost search website

01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:58,039
the verification process

01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:58,039
[Music]

01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:07,840
secure security

01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:15,119
okay wonderful so i when i first saw

01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:17,920
this video i found

01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:19,760
the concept of using uh blockchain

01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,800
solutions for like verifiable

01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:24,080
certification to be

01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,840
super cool and super interesting so uh

01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:27,599
let's now take a step back once again

01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,080
and do a thorough analysis in this case

01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,560
study

01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,920
also uh i'll again be similarly talking

01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,719
about the problem that we're dealing

01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,679
with

01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:36,480
the current solution uh how blockchain

01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:38,800
can basically

01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,560
help address this problem and also the

01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,880
challenges of implementation of a

01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,320
blockchain solution

01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:46,080
so if you take a look at this problem

01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:48,480
that this video kind of you know hinted

01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:50,639
at and kind of described for us the

01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:52,639
the problem can be thought of as you

01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:55,679
know as to prompt

01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:57,679
so the first aspect of the problem

01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,800
is that the issuing of a lot of

01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:01,520
counterfeit circle

01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,239
certificates actually exist in reality

01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,159
and there are actually a lot of

01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:06,480
counterfeit circuit certificates

01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:08,560
that are being passed down and being and

01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:10,960
that are in circulation today

01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,040
so what is the counterfeit certificate

01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,960
suppose that i'm a student who actually

01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:17,760
did not study in a ctd

01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,280
i can actually create a fake certificate

01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,760
with some fake credentials

01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:22,880
saying that i studied an sutd from this

01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,880
year to this year

01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:26,639
and this is the degree that i got and i

01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,400
can show this to an employer

01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,560
and basically saying see i'll have a

01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:32,000
degree now you can employ me and take me

01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,800
into your organization so that is the

01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,040
problem

01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,520
the first aspect of the problem uh that

01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:39,679
open source is trying to tackle

01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:41,199
so this has actually has a lot of

01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:44,560
disastrous

01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:47,280
implications so just imagine a situation

01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,800
where a surgeon who's hired to perform

01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:51,760
surgery on you

01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:53,840
actually does not have the required

01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:54,400
credentials to be present in the surgery

01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,320
room

01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,880
or and to be present in that operation

01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:01,040
theater and instead made his way

01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,480
to the operation theater only through

02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,360
counterfeit certification so you can

02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:06,400
just think about

02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,800
how scary uh you know such such an issue

02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,360
is

02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:10,480
and the potentially disastrous

02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:12,000
implications

02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:14,159
that such you know problems would give

02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,480
rise to

02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:18,639
uh the second aspect of the problem is

02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:19,679
that the verifying of a large number of

02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:22,480
certificates

02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:24,560
is actually very lengthy and happens in

02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:27,280
a very painstaking process

02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:29,520
so the prop the entire process of

02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:32,000
certificate notary notarization

02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,520
is very very lengthy uh in how involves

02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,199
a lot of checks and balances

02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,880
uh and it involves going through you

02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:40,159
know a lot of you know

02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:42,000
people and a lot of processes and

02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:44,239
so this entire process is very

02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,880
painstaking and also consumes a lot in

02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:46,880
lot of time

02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:55,040
so anyway uh

02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:56,320
let's now talk about how

02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,000
the current solutions which are actually

02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,800
being put in place to address this

02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
problem

02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:04,159
so surprisingly before you know

02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,520
a blockchain solution was adopted there

02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:08,639
was no solution that was

02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:12,719
put in place for such an issue so we do

02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:15,360
have uh you know you know traditional

02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:16,239
uh you know notary services which are

02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,639
basically used

02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:19,440
to to kind of establish authenticity of

02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:21,599
certificates

02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:23,760
but there was no digital and

02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:24,320
standardized way to track and manage

02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,119
these

02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:28,320
accomplishments and so in short there

02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,840
was simply no solution

02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:33,119
to the specific problems that open

02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:33,119
search is trying to solve

02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:39,520
let's now talk about enter blockchain

02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:41,199
so the blockchain can be used to provide

02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,880
an automated platform

02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:45,599
for certificate and credential

02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:48,480
verification as its key features

02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,639
are number one the ability to prevent

02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:53,360
counterfeit certification

02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:55,280
of by being issued by ensuring that all

02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:57,520
certificates are

02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:58,880
basically validated and vetted through a

02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:02,639
trumpet-proof system

02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:04,960
based on immutability and transparency

02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:05,840
that is the first key aspect the second

02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:08,159
key aspect

02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:09,760
is that this that the entire process of

02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:13,119
validation of a certificate

02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:15,679
can now be seriously shortened uh as

02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:17,199
the current solutions can just involve

02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:19,040
the pushing of transaction into a

02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:20,719
blockchain rather than making it go

02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:23,199
through and centralized authority

02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:24,159
or a middle man who has to oversee the

02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:27,040
entire process

02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:28,480
and who has a very limited capacity so

02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,040
this is how blockchain can actually be

02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:32,239
used

02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:33,599
to tackle this you know problem

02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:36,159
and this is the solution that it can

02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:38,239
bring uh that we can use to bring about

02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:39,199
change in the entire system

02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:41,520
what are the challenges of

02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:42,080
implementation of such a solution so the

02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,520
main

02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:46,639
implementational challenge for

02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:48,639
blockchain solution for this uh

02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:50,239
you know specific use case of this

02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:53,360
specific problem

02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:54,080
is that completely new systems uh give

02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,880
rise

02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:58,239
to a lot of difficulty in transitioning

02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,480
from legacy structures

02:02:58,239 --> 02:03:01,520
in organization that have been that have

02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,560
grown used

02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:07,040
to implementing a conventional system

02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:09,040
so what is essentially means is that all

02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,719
these uh you know all these institutions

02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:13,599
which basically are to use

02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:14,000
a blockchain system to effectively

02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:16,480
verify

02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,360
their transaction we find will find it

02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:19,440
very hard

02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:21,360
to transition from the existing system

02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,840
as these systems are legacy systems and

02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,320
have been

02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,320
set in place long ago and have been in

02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:28,960
use for a very very long time

02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:29,520
so there will be a barrier uh when it

02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:32,159
comes to

02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,679
adoption and so it's all about how can

02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:36,400
we simplify this barrier

02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:37,119
and how can we enable adoption uh to

02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:40,000
happen much

02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:41,199
easier and and for this entire process

02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,480
to happen

02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:47,520
a lot more seamlessly so that

02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:49,679
is it about the second case study

02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,960
and how blockchain can be used to

02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:52,800
provide

02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,000
uh you know tamper-proof certificates

02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:58,719
and and for valid

02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,719
by validating uh you know credentials

02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:03,440
of the certificates which are basically

02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:03,440
in circulation today

02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:10,000
so uh with that with that

02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:11,520
i thank you all for joining me for

02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,320
today's workshop it is a pleasure to

02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,239
have you all

02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,599
that concludes my session and that's

02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:17,280
basically all the content

02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:18,639
that i'd like to share with you but

02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,760
before we wrap up

02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:21,679
to summarize everything that we

02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,360
discussed so we started

02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:25,760
so this workshop basically has three

02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:27,440
parts part one part two part three

02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:29,679
so in the first part we spoke about

02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:31,920
decentralization immutability

02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:32,800
and traceability which are the key

02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,360
foundation

02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:37,040
uh foundational properties that make

02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,719
blockchain powerful and made blockchain

02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:40,639
what it is today

02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:42,800
we then went on to talk a little bit

02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:44,960
more about

02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:45,920
uh the various blockchain protocols

02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:48,400
which are in use

02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,239
and what a smart contract effectively is

02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:52,079
and we finally conclude in the session

02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:53,599
by talking a little bit more about

02:04:52,079 --> 02:04:56,239
blockchain decision models

02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,360
which help you design for what problems

02:04:56,239 --> 02:05:00,320
a blockchain solution

02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:02,480
is perfect and we also deep dive a

02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:04,719
little bit more into existing use cases

02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:07,360
and case studies of blockchain solutions

02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:10,159
which are in the market today

02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:11,679
so with that i i conclude all the

02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:13,360
content that i'd like to cover

02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:15,040
and i'd like to open up the floors for

02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,840
any questions that that you'd like to

02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:18,159
ask me

02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,960
which i'd be more than happy to answer

02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:22,239
i'll just quickly

02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:23,199
shift back to the uh forsake chat chat

02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:25,119
also to see

02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:26,560
if if anyone would like to ask any

02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:30,639
questions there

02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:32,719
and i'd also like to take this chance to

02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:34,560
for all our physical attendees i'd like

02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:35,840
to take this chance to personally get to

02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,280
know a little bit more about what you

02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:39,679
felt about this workshop

02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:40,960
and and and also hope to answer any

02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:42,480
questions that you might have

02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,960
and and anything that that you might

02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:45,599
like to ask uh but before that there is

02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,719
another

02:05:45,599 --> 02:06:03,840
opportunity that uh i'd like to share

02:05:48,719 --> 02:06:03,840
with all of you

02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:14,400
okay i hope my screen is visible now

02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:16,159
you can all see my screen right so uh

02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:20,480
i'd like to talk a little bit more

02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:22,560
uh about the skills future

02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:24,639
so are you looking to upgrade your

02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,599
skills for a career progression or

02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:28,000
transition

02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:29,199
but are you not aware where to start

02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,440
then what you can do

02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:32,320
is you can speak with skilled futures

02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:35,119

02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:42,880
needed and gaps and help you gain

02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,440
useful tips and advice on how to kick

02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,639
start

02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:49,360
your skills search scan this qr code and

02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:51,520
explore more

02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,480
this is the qr code that you can scan to

02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:56,840
get in touch

02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:59,840
with skill future singapore's skills

02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:59,840
ambassador

02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,599
i'll give you five minutes to scan this

02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,360
qr code

02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:11,040
uh okay not five minutes time is a bit

02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:14,159
too much i'll give you another minute to

02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:15,760
scan this qr code

02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:17,599
but in case you're not able to get it no

02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:19,840
worries all the other

02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:20,800
workshop attendees and participants will

02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:24,560
also have these

02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:40,400
slides showing up on your screen

02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:44,639
and and you can you can catch it

02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:45,760
okay uh and your feedback is also very

02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:47,840

potentially improve

02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,040
going forward and what you liked about

02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,320
