i also serve as a board for open source

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,399
collective which is an amazing project

project

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
and when it comes to open source's stuff

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,600
i am a contributor for sugar labs i

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,960
previously was a board member for the

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,439
project but right now

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
i'm more focused as a contributor on the

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,320
project making sure

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,520
that you know you know building tools

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,920
for education

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,360
is is a priority for me so i'm it's a

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,360
project i'm super excited about

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,640
lastly i am part of this program amazing

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,520
program from github called the github

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
star

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
and you know it enabled me to you know

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,119
interac better interact with the

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
community at large to see how

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,880
you know we could help when it comes to

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,159
you know sustainability particularly in

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
communities like mine

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,240
so it's very amazing that i'm part of

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,079
the program

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,000
so you know if we want to talk about

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,560
open source there's one country that you

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
know

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,759
we we we should you know definitely look

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
out for

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,600
and not because i'm from nigeria but the

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,840
fact that there's numbers that

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
sort of back you know the the the

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,600
country

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,439
so as you can see here this is the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,399
latest report from github

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,079
showing the fastest growing countries on

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
the platform

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,840
so nigeria happens to be you know the

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,560
fastest growing country when it comes to

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,560
you know

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,800
um you know numbers of project and you

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,800
know when it when it comes to like how

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,319
expanding you know contributors are

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
coming particularly in the open source

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
space

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
now why is this number growing or what

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
does this number represent or what what

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,680
is

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,480
bringing this energy from a continent

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
like africa

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,160
simple like i said or as this

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,599
slide is is showing about 60

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,920
at youth and these are my friends um

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
we we took this photo well i'm not dead

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
anyways

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
so these are my friends they they were

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
they're actually standing at the

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
the the festival which we which i'm

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
going to talk about later

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,239
on um it just shows how

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,200
young the the open source community

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,440
space in africa looks like this is the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,800
typical contributor behind every project

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,959
that you know

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
and i can't talk about open source in

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
africa without talking about

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,760
the the tagline this is something that

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
my friends

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
over at open source community africa we

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,879
keep saying

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,440
the future is open now what does that

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,519
mean

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,599
in order for us to to make sure that we

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
we have a system that is that is there

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,599
to kind of support and to to also help

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
in collaboration

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,000
this is the structure that i i am my

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,519
friend over at the open source community

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
africa that we're currently doing when

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,480
it comes to helping to define

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,159
to shape and to help grow you know the

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,760
ecosystem

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,080
so how are we building we we started as

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,519
as you know right now the current

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
version anyways

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,040
we we we're currently working with

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,319
developers designers and also technical

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,000
writers

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,000
and the reason why we're we're trying to

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,040
do more stuff away from you know just

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
focus on developers is the fact that you

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
know when it comes to open source

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
there's not just the diversity of people

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
but also the diversity of skill sets so

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
it's very important for us

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,640
you know we at oscar to make sure that

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,879
we have great supporting system for

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
even you know non-coders and you know

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,919
people that do

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,000
things around other technical skill

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,560
so if you look at this slide you see

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
that um and at oscar which is obviously

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
at the top

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,120
it's kind of driven in two ways there's

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
the community side of things and then

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
there's a project side of things

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
and between the community side of things

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
we have a system in place i would say

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,639
more of a program that is called the

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
chapter program

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
now this chapter program enabled oscar

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
which is the open source community

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
africa

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
to go into local cities and to be able

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
to help

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,240
to support what is required in the local

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,600
cities so it's like

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,600
your typical developers program like

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
for example one of the most popular

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
developers program in the world

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
is the google developers program so it's

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
like the typical gdg

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
that you know that is around your city

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,039
but this is more in line with

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
oscar and more in line with the open

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
source uh

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,160
vision so we use this chapter program as

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,720
a way for us to

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,080
go into different cities across africa

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,320
and then we identify

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
people and also great communities that

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,039
want to do more

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,919
in open source and secondly

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,360
the festival we initially did the first

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,360
one in 2020

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
um we're still working on seeing the

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,080
possibility of doing one this year

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
but the festival aim is to kind of

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,520
create

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,520
an annual or maybe twice a year um

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,759
program that sort of

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
celebrate and you know create a system

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,199
where people can network you like your

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
typical summits like or

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,919
in this case like first asia right so

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
you know it's it's a system in place

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
where

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
we we have a way for people to come in

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
and to explore and to share

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
things that we're working on so it's one

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
of the amazing things for us over at you

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
know

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,199
as part of our community program now

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,319
when it comes to project projects is a

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,080
little bit tricky because

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,639
internally we don't have a lot of

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,280
projects but for us to be able to make

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,360
sure that

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,479
we like we said you know building a next

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,680
billion creators which is

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,919
is a team for us internally at oscar

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
we want to bring things into two

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,880
different parts

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,840
so first advocacy and second

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,680
contributions or contributors now

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,319
advocacy is the opportunity for us to

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
work with

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
people that identify as open tourists

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,800
advocate

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
to help them to give them a system in

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,280
place

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
that enable them to go out and to

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,520
publicly talk about open source so just

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,720
typically what i'm doing right now

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,360
i'm serving as an advocate i'm for oscar

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
at force asia so that's what a typical

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
advocate in

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
in the open source community africa

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,280
space does

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,280
and now there's a contribution side of

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,639
things which is kind of like the same

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,599
thing anyways but just

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,120
different wording now we work with open

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,160
source communities and we work with open

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,479
source projects in

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
i'm outside of oscar and then we bring

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,160
them internally

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,720
within our community to enable people

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
that

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
want to contribute to project to be for

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,680
them to be able to contribute so make

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,199
making sure that we have a system in

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
place while working with other

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
communities

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
to make sure that we have more people

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
going into that project

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
so the advocacy side and the contributor

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,280
side are two key ways

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
that we drive the project creation and

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,440
project contributions

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,120
over at oscar

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,639
now this is a bit tricky and this is

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
also really funny

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,880
um you know one of the things that i've

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,400
i noticed particularly because myself

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,599
i've been traveling a lot

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,479
not text to covet anymore um you know

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,280
whenever i go to conferences or i you

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,120
know

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,840
say i'm from africa i'm coming from

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,000
africa people often confuse africa to be

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,759
a country

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,360
and now i'm not going to say you know

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,280
trying to fought anybody in you know

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
it's you know we are humans humans make

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
mistakes but

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
often people don't really want to make

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
research

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
but also really welcome anyways so

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,520
africa is not a country

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,440
africa is a continent it's a continent

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,000
like asia like you know

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
north america europe south america and

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,240
you know

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
like i mentioned asia and australia

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,199
now i'm not obviously going to you know

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
show the map of africa but this is

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,039
more of like to show you where the

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,199
version one of our program started

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
obviously in nigeria which is where most

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,919
of the open source community africa

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
folks lives

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
so it's very typical for us to have more

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
representations in nigeria compared to

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
other side of

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
the continent so over at nigeria when we

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,360
started

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
i live in port harcourt and my my

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,680
co-founder

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,279
she's based in lagos so that was the two

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,040
main place for us when it comes to

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,120
having local events

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
and eventually we grew to more cities

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
within africa within nigeria

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
and then while working on that we were

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,760
like okay it's time for us to expand but

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
then

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,880
one of the hardest thing in africa is

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,120
how

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,240
diverse you know the continent is in

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,800
general

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
from things like language you know

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
cultures

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,519
and multiple things right so what we

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,480
started doing was to closely work with

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,800
individuals

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,680
like our friends that are in this these

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
countries

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,360
and then see the past the best possible

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,519
ways for us to expand

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,040
the oscar vision down to their community

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,720
and in order for us to do that we

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,279
created a chapter program which

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,120
i i previously mentioned now we use the

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,640
chapter program to expand to other

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,839
cities and other countries

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,959
in africa and this this

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,519
um screenshot here was i think was was

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,839
taken sometime around late 2019

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,640
so before 2018 when we started and

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,880
sometime around um late 2019

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
we're in about five countries and over

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,839
11 cities

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
currently we're working on the version 2

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,800
of the chapter program that should

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
enable us to cover

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,680
as much african countries as possible

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,040
particularly do more in the in the south

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
and probably do more in the north

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
so these are the normal um ways that our

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,160
community event looks

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,480
so from some photos somewhere in kenya

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
to some in port harcourt to some in

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,880
lagos and some in other part of you know

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,720
nigeria another part of africa

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,959
so what we normally do is to have a

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
local smaller smaller event where we

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,399
talk about open source and talk about

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,240
contributions or even do more

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,959
hackathons or maybe hack some open

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,959
source project

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
now this this is an amazing list for me

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,600
and this is a a project

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
created by a friend of mine called ace

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,480
kid

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
now we had a back in nigeria again

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
going back to the github research

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
there's a lot of projects coming out of

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,040
nigeria one of the most popular one

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,399
right now on top of my head is called

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,560
chakra ui

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,079
um and and it's been used by a lot of

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,760
companies and a lot of individuals

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,480
within the javascript ecosystem and it

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,240
just shows how amazing it is

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
now he made a list called mainly nigeria

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,399
it's on github you can go search it up

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
and this is the way for you to see props

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,800
that have definitely come

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,240
out of nigeria into the global open

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,440
source space

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,920
so you can if you want to learn more

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,399
about it the link is down

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,000
to correct i think it's called

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,000
ask.github.io slash made in nigeria

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,360
and you know speaking about our

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
community event we were at some point in

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
order for us to

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
make people to become creators and to

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,399
have you know more open source projects

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,279
we started making them to work on

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,000
projects

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,680
that may improve the engineering skill

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,880
or maybe designing skill or technical

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
writing skill

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
so we worked with our partners open

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240
collective which is a platform where

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
oscar is registered when it comes to

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
fundraising

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,440
and what we did at that time was to work

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
closely with the team to come up with a

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,000
bounty program that would be

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,839
available within the oscar ecosystem or

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,680
oscar community

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,880
and if you look at the slide very well

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,360
you see like

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,000
price tag like fifty dollars hundred

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,720
dollars

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and you know some other couple price tag

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
been instead

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,440
and we closely share this bounty within

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,440
the community and people that

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,079
wants to work with them definitely start

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,079
working with them

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
aside from the bounties you know design

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,200
is one of the important things

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,480
here in africa you know africa does have

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
a lot of art

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,399
and it's very typical that it's you see

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
a lot of designers coming out of the

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,040
continent

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,959
and in order for us to make sure that we

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,399
have a system in place that will help

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,720
designers locally

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,519
particularly they want to do more stuff

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,639
you know

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
out of africa is by collaborating with

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
the

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,639
with the kind of in my opinion the the

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,560
main group that sort of

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,880
helped shape open source design which is

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,800
the open source design.net group

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,120
so we started working with them closely

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,519
sometime around 2019 with some amazing

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
members within the within the team to

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,480
kind of work with us

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
closely to see how we could shape things

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
and one of the ways that we create

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
diversity in africa

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,399
particularly bringing more women in open

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,279
source is by partnering with a

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,440
second organization called chico africa

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
social africa is a is a non-profit

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
organization that

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,279
strictly helps more women into

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,240
technology and sometime around 2019 to

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,160
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
oscar was able to collaborate with chico

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,480
africa to bring more women into open

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,480
source

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,160
um going back to the bounties again this

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,639
was basically what you know we were able

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
to do

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,120
in order to improve an actual coding

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
experience for some persons that

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
identify

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,120
as developers now this is kind of

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
one of the highlights of the festival

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
and it's amazing showing how group of

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,920
individuals are coming together to

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
discuss open tourists

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
now just like what i mentioned right the

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
next video on creators

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,079
sorry this was a screenshot i took for

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,959
from the festival last year but just

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,959
shows

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,560
how amazing we've come particularly for

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
the open source community africa and

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,800
it's one of the amazing things that i

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,959
i'm really excited about as a co-founder

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,839
seeing how we've been able to grow under

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,839
the last two years

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,120
so anyways thank you very much thank you

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
thank you thank you
