Publication date: 2021-03-08
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2021
Description: 
	About the speaker: Joydeep Mitra is an Assistant Professor of Practice at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. He is interested in exploring ways to build secure and robust software systems. He is currently focussed on Android application (app) security. In this context, his work involves developing benchmarks and measures to empirically evaluate solutions related to Android app security along with developing design methodologies that aid in building secure Android apps. His research in Android app security has led to the discovery of vulnerabilities in the Android platform which have been publicly acknowledged and fixed by Google

Apart from his primary interest in secure software engineering, he is also interested in developing tools, techniques, and algorithms that facilitate the use and analysis of data. Consequently, he has dabbled with Cheminformatics which deals with use of computers and informational techniques to solve problems related to Chemistry, specifically Crystallography.
