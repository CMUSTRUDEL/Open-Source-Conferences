hello

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,520
my name is sai eminer today i'm going to

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,080
talk about

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,960
tracking personal health um during the

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,440
pandemic

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
this is a pre-recorded talk i chose to

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
record my talk

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,720
because of time zone differences

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,720
i have included my contact information

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
in the last slide

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
please do get in touch with me if you

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,160
have any questions

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
about today's talk i really hope you

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
enjoy

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,200
this talk a little bit about myself

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
i'm an iot applications engineer at

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
lindy in buffalo new york

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
in case you have not heard of lindy

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,280
lindy is an industrial gases company

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
and you have probably used lindy's

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
products

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,559
in your life if you have ever consumed

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
fast food

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,600
excuse me if you have ever consumed a

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,520
beverage

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
carbonated beverage at a fast food

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,399
restaurant or

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,199
a helium balloon or purchased a helium

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
balloon

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,600
at a party supply store

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,799
in my free time i like to build products

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,119
that help improve my quality of life

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
i like to share my projects at maker

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,000
faires across the country

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
and i'm also recognized by intel as an

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,960
iot innovator

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
a little bit about designably my brother

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,040
and i

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,799
started this nonprofit to build low-cost

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,880
open source products um that could be

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,200
uh you know um used by

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
um people uh with chronic health

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
conditions

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,520
and uh we uh you know we strive to

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,040
uh develop products that could be easily

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,159
built by others and improved upon um

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,759
we do this uh you know we remotely

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,600
collaborate um

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,560
on these projects and time to time

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,280
we um you know we include external

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,119
partners

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,439
um on some of these um projects

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,479
and today i'm going to share about uh

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,319
the some of the

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,840
stuff we built during the pandemic

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,599
um our process is basically we try to

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,120
identify problems in our remote

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,560
immediate surroundings

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,680
we take it forward with the prototype

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,520
we try to improve upon

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,599
each generation of the prototype and we

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
publish the designs in various

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,080
conferences

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,440
as well as you know make them available

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,480
on through our github repositories

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,760
um now why did we pick

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,400
uh personal health uh we come from a

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
family

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
that actually struggles with you know

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
that actually

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,560
um has gone through uh chronic health

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,760
conditions through several generations

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,159
and we desire and um since my brother

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
and i

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,840
are both engineers we wanted to um

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
um you know give back to the community

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
uh by

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,440
uh building products um that help people

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,120
with uh chronic health conditions um

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,760
like you know keeping track of

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
uh uh you know like you know helping

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,959
people with chronic

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,760
health conditions is something very

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,120
personal to both my brother and myself

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,440
um so we actually a couple of years ago

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
we

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
actually built this person on her

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,480
dashboard using a raspberry pi zero

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
um so this um personal health dashboard

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
was basically built

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
using a shadow box from an arts and

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,519
crafts store

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,319
um and we used uh we used an

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,640
eight um you know we used an rgb led

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,080
strip and a raspberry pi zero

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,680
where we collected um like our physical

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,319
activity data from our um

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,080
from our uh you know variable uh

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,360
variable you know

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,360
trackers uh app uh and

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,640
um you know and light up uh uh the leds

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,560
of this uh strip like a progress bar

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,280
so as we make um pro like as we

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,600
walk a thousand two steps fifty step for

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,400
every thousand to fifty steps we walk

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,479
uh uh the uh led lights up green in

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,120
color so there are a total of eight

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,560
leds so it lights up as you make

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,320
progress and once you hit

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,960
the daily um step go the entire rgb

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,160
strip

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,320
is green in color um so we built this

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,800
dashboard to uh you know to motivate

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,600
ourselves to stay physically active

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
and we wanted to improve upon this

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,320
design

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
where we decided to build this giant

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,240
seven segment display using

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,800
five um and seven segment digits

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
and uh we did several experiments with

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
this display where

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
initially we were counting up to our

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
daily step go

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
we found out that it doesn't exactly

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,759
give us an idea of

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,720
the level of physical activity

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
required on a slow day for example so we

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,120
decided to count

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,440
down from our daily step goal um so

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,039
that actually you know gives you an idea

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
of like you know how long should you

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,280
walk

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,800
um should you mix up your um

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
the um your physical activity um so that

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,440
you hit your

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,000
daily step goal um sooner

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,560
this uh display actually sits in my

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
living room serving as a stark reminder

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,280
that

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,919
i should get up and you know uh walk

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280
around

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,759
for a little bit then the covet pandemic

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
head

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,520
where we are we were all pushed into a

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,400
strange world where we had to conduct

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,039
daily temperature screenings

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,520
you know monitor for symptoms for

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,479
example my workplace required that i

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,840
conduct

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,319
daily uh temperature screenings um

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,800
that's when we came up with the idea of

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,080
building a non-contact thermometer

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,000
based on screening station

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
in this picture here you can see a

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
raspberry pi

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
interface to a camera and a tower light

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
and

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,919
a thermal sensor

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,919
so the idea here is that when a person

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,120
is you know

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,880
comes into in front of the camera

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,319
the ir grid sensor is used

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,600
to conduct the temperature screening

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
and it gives a go no-go decision based

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
upon

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,120
the temperature measured this sensor is

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,600
somewhat um affected by you know

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,880
external environment conditions

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,440
so based upon the room temperature

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,160
the the temperature measured could be

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,880
higher on

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
lower so the best you could do is you

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,360
know whether

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,720
you detect whether or not a person has

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,160
fever now this is not good enough uh

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,560
because you know the body temperature

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,840
varies from person to person

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,880
that actually uh motivated us to go

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,919
find a variable you know to go build a

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
variable

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,360
that could actually measure body

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,440
temperature

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,400
we came across this contact thermometer

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,680
sensor

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,960
called the max30205 so

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,680
we built a very small variable device

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,280
that can actually provide body

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,039
temperature measurements

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,000
uh you know which with uh that's rated

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
for clinical

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,720
accuracy even with this sensor there is

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
a shot coming because

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,440
you know body temperature measurement

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,199
is best you know is accurate when you

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
actually conduct these measurements

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
either under your

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,080
armpit or like you know um

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
on your fingertips uh you know there are

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
only

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,879
certain parts of your body um where

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
temp like external temperature

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,000
measurements

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,199
are comes close to uh

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,599
the um comes

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
really close to the um accurate

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,879
measurement

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
but that you know that is good enough

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
like you know that that

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,120
actually provides a sense of whether or

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
not

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,919
you are running a fever this um

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,479
contact thermometer actually you know

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:42,000
like it it comes really close to um

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,120
the clinical grade thermometer sensors

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,760
um so we decided to actually improve on

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,560
this design where we built a

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,240
uh you know a second generation of this

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,050
design where we actually

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
added a bluetooth module um

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,440
[Music]

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
to the variable so that you could

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,399
automatically

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,600
record your daily temperature

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,399
measurement

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,480
um so whenever you conduct a you know uh

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,959
temperature measurement that the the

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,240
data is automatically pushed

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,360
um to your uh smartphone now

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
as a part of uh you know um so the for

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,410
the past year we have

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,320
also been um

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,839
[Music]

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,120
we all have been working from home and

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,839
reach research has shown that

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
you know in order to stay healthy you

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,240
have to make sure

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,440
that you know your indoor air quality

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,480
you know is at a at a

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,720
is at a healthy level so we actually

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,440
purchased various indoor air quality

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,640
sensors

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,600
and we built um you know we worked on

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,040
various projects around monitoring

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
indoor air quality

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,000
so for example on the left here we have

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,160
used a raspberry pi

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,160
0 to interface it to a

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,079
voc sensor that constantly monitors the

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,279
equal and carbon dioxide

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,519
levels in the room and it changes its

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,079
color there is the rgb led

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,920
um that's interfaced to the pi zero um

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,279
changes its color

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,079
um according to the uh measured um

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,600
carbon dioxide levels in the room now we

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,040
also wanted to see

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,279
like you know what is the air quality

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
in different rooms at different times of

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,240
the day so

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,279
where we built this battery powered

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
device

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,680
um that could be connected to any i

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,680
squared c based

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
any sensor that comes with an i squared

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,320
c uh

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,880
interface um and it could it could run

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,959
without having without needing a battery

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,120
change for several years

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,880
um so this is an active experiment where

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,079
we have

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
installed multiple sensor nodes around

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,160
the house and we

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,279
are collecting data and we plan to

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,560
publish this information once we have

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,200
further refined this uh design

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,920
so these are um the various things that

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
my brother

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,279
and i uh you know collaborate um

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,279
and work together we publish all of our

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,279
designs in our github

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,079
repo and if you do have any questions

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,320
uh please um get in touch with me uh at

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,079
