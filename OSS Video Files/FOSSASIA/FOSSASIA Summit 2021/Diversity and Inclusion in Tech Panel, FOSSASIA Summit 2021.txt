on diversity and inclusion in tech

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
as we all know the start of this decade

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,439
has a tremendous

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,200
you know uh shift in what's happening in

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,040
the world and we see a convergence of

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,159
three very major trends

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,240
number one the digital acceleration has

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,399
you know exponentially grown

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,079
uh in all the markets around the world

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,119
in the midst of a pandemic

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,320
we see job disruptions um in the markets

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,600
whether it's remote

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,640
or physically we see a range of you know

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,360
calls for all of us to be

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,479
moving in with a greater voice uh

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
inclusivity

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,920
equity as well as social justice and

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,759
more than ever

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360
you know in the midst of such sweeping

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,360
change you and i

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
and the organization has an opportunity

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,000
to really make a difference here

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,720
today i'm super privileged to be joined

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
by a distinguished panel of leaders

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,920
women whom i call captains of their

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
respective field

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,440
and more importantly they are truly the

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
change makers

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,520
that inspire all of us to do more we're

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
going to have a conversation around

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
diversity and inclusion and tech

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,800
we're going to touch on some very

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
personal stories

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,239
and more importantly look at the biases

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,920
the discrimination

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
or the barriers we see in the market

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,160
today in the world today

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,959
and how we can all collectively push

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,440
ourselves

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,440
to think outside of the box and draw on

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
all the empirical evidence that exists

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
today to help us

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
identify you know promising errors where

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
we can

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
look at investment where we can direct

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,519
our leadership voices and focus

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
and more importantly what experiment we

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
all can conduct

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,959
so that this will all serve as a

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,680
remarkable engine of change

freely

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
i'll start with you know our panel

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,039
discussion with a speed round

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,560
the recent events has been a very big

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,440
reminder for all of us

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
that persistent inequalities continue to

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
pervade

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,360
our society and economies so as we seek

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,479
more responsibility from companies and

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
individuals

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
in the whole issue of diversity equality

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
i'd like to start with my first question

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,240
to the panelists

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,639
what what are your most passionate top

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
of my topic when it comes to diversity

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:44,320
and inclusion can we start with maybe

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,240
miss han uh yes i mean for me because

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,680
coming from the country sector so

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,039
inclusion of a diverse range of sector

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,000
into the uh tech scene

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,000
is a very very interesting topic to me

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
and this is something that we have begun

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
to

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,680
to explore here at unesco

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
that's very very exciting thank you miss

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,960
han uh

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
dr

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
so i think when you talk about diversity

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
um

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,759
the most important thing is to make sure

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,919
that different people

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,520
are represented at at

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,160
during the development right from the

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,840
beginning uh we always hear of stories

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
where there are products that

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,280
are designed and then you know they they

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
misrepresent

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,319
or misalign certain kinds of audiences

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
and one of the reasons why that happens

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
is because the stakeholders

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,440
the diversity is not there right from

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,479
the beginning so having the diverse

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,960
uh viewpoints on the table um

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,639
enables us to ensure that the wider

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,440
population is represented

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,080
when something goes out

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,479
[Music]

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,599
i think that's an amazing you know very

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,199
very important topic when it comes to

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
when we're looking at especially in the

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,560
world of technology where we hope to use

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,599
technology

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,160
pretty much bring in the equality

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,319
uh the design phase and the product

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
development phase is very very critical

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,360
that's where you know you've dedicated

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
your passion to

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
helping stem in education and that's

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
where we we want to kick start from

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,639
development phase to your point

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,639
uh so thank you doctor um how about home

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
i totally agree with han and and

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,039
kirutika so diversity and blue

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,759
and is very important not only

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,960
in the tech sector but everywhere in our

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
society right

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,440
in order to whatever we do in in the

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,440
tech industry we want to be a product we

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,319
want to get it into the user

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,479
hand and uh we need to have the user

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,280
view upon represented in the development

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,560
phase

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,879
and without the um

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,479
diversity and inclusion in the way we

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
work in the way we develop

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
it difficult to say that we can

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
represent

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,440
our user we can understand the the whole

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,160
journey and

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,199
and and the opinion of the user so

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
definitely to

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
msi again it's really important that we

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,720
ensure

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,800
um an inclusive environment in in the

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,560
tech industry thank you

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
very nice which is why you've been so

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,279
passionate about championing

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
open platform open collaborations uh so

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,159
thank you

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,959
you know for us at microsoft uh i would

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,919
say for me

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,240
right now uh there is so much we have to

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,279
do

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,600
in the arena of diversity and inclusion

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,839
uh but currently for us you know one of

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
our top of mind is how do we address the

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,240
gender inequality

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
how do we also look at the space of

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,160
people with disability

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,080
so if you look at the un sustainable

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,320
goal for example it talks about how

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,240
gender equality is not only

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
a fundamental human right but more

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,720
importantly a very very necessary

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
foundation if we are all looking to

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
enjoy a peaceful prosperous and

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,040
sustainable

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,519
you know world but yet in the arena of

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,120
you know what we're seeing today

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
especially post coping right we're

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,880
seeing how

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,279
women are work among the most hardest

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
hit

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,920
when it comes to post covic uh impact

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,720
and you're looking at a rate where the

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,839
estimated

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,519
job loss rate for women is twice higher

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,920
than that compared to

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,959
the males and at the same time you know

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,839
we talked about

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,560
uh dr kiritika and hong you talk about

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,560
how

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,880
digital technologies today are going to

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,279
be that backbone of the economies

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
uh for us to build a resilient future

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,920
but if you look at

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
world economic report uh uh on gender

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,160
report

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,519
uh 2020 it is it is a very very stark

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,080
realization that

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
how women is actually underrepresented

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,079
in emerging tech roles

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,720
uh we have very you know

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,440
glaring statistics like 12 percent only

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,240
are represented in cloud computing when

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,320
the world is moving into cloud

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
and hong you talk about how without the

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
right representation you're not going to

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
get

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,760
the design phase and development plate

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
baseline

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,279
in the same way we know the involvement

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
of data and ai

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,000
but there's only 26 percent of women

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,920
representation in that field

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
so i would say you know from that

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,320
perspective uh

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
us at microsoft are looking at how do we

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
actually

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,760
really bring in place the right

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,240
programs and foundation uh pretty much

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,440
for

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
women in the tech world uh i hold that

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
for for a second

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
uh let me also maybe quickly share

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,959
something that we're super passionate

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
about

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,880
uh the world the bho estimated that

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
about 15 of the world population that's

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,399
close to about a billion

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
people with live with some form of a

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,360
disability

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,440
and in asia pacific you know we're

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,640
looking at one in six people

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
has faced some types of challenges or

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,680
barriers to enable them to be fully

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,959
participant

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,680
in the economic arena in society

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,519
uh with this start number you know we

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,880
are passionate about what can we do

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,680
you know really to take inclusion

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
for the people with disability and it is

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
very

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,240
very telling that you know by excluding

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,360
this population of people

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
from our job in our workforce we're

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
actually

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
causing an impact of seven percent to

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,200
gdp around our countries

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
uh so maybe just just a quick start to

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
kick start the discussion

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,279
i just want to focus a little bit on uh

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
women as well as disability when it

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,800
comes to

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,399
inclusion uh and start by sharing a

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,600
little bit of what we are doing

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,680
uh at microsoft at microsoft you know it

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
is really our mantra to empower every

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,399
person every organization to achieve

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
more

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,079
we specifically look at you know how do

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
we to dr

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,560
kirikita's point stem is an era where

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
you start grooming

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
you know pretty much talent in this

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,160
arena

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,839
we're very very intentional about how do

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,480
we inspire young girls

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
the one uh pick up those you know

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
subjects

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,560
in their school in education and uh

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
then create programs where we can help

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,760
them create give them opportunities and

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
environment

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,480
uh for mentorship and sponsorship so we

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,519
we we have this program for what we call

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
digital girls

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,240
basically going to schools and helping

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,200
you know children equip them with the

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
systems as well as the devices and the

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
coaching to be able to learn and start

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,160
coding from young

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,440
this is one example the other one i'll

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,760
talk a little bit later

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,800
is women in ai we see we're very very

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,560
passionate we talk about how only 26

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
of the populations are actually

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,000
represented by women

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
but this is going to perpetuate in the

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,160
product development cycle

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,000
if we do not increase the representation

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
so we'll be launching a program called

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,760
women in ai

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
really providing the ability to skill

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,480
and learn

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,279
and as well as take up certification in

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,839
ai

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,560
and provide that internship and

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,160
mentorship to bring

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,760
women actively into the working arena

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,959
from that perspective in in the space

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,040
of disability inclusion

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
we're looking at how do we drive

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,880
inclusive hiring programs

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,199
and this may sound um uh uh

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,079
like hey it's part of the hiring program

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
but i

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,120
urge all organizations out there to be

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,600
considerate

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
and cons you know to consider approach

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
and inclusive hiring

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
to ensure that you create an environment

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,279
and a platform where

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
people with disability can have equal

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
equitable opportunities

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,920
in participating in this arena and uh

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,639
just just a point of

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,360
interest recently we have this uh

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,320
program

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
uh called neurodiversity this looks at

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,480
hiring people

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,279
with neural uh diversity challenges and

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,320
basically

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,560
you know to demonstrate that we in the

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,519
workplace can intentionally provide the

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,399
right environment

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,040
safe environment to leverage and utilize

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
uh

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,760
diverse skill sets uh i think in the

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,199
picture you will see that philip jarvis

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,480
in um in uh it is is a engineer that

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,120
recently landed

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,600
his dream jobs with hololens so he is

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,639
experimenting and working with hololens

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,120
despite his uh uh uh

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,959
disability and equally effective in

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,839
participating in this

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,320
uh so those are two you know arenas we

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,959
want to

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,399
really really uh look into and and

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,600
invest into

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,839
um and with that let me uh turn the lens

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,320
back to our panelists

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
you all come with amazing stories you

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,320
are trailblazer

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,360
uh can we maybe start with a little

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
story of

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,839
you know how you started in the tech

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,839
community how you get involved

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,360
uh and share with us you know something

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,760
uh exciting that happened in that

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
journey

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,720
so maybe we start with uh dr kim thieker

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,800
all right okay um how did i get started

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,399
in text so i think i always wanted to do

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,680
something in science right so

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,639
um being an investment best subject in

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
school

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,480
and i was fortunate that there has

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
always been opportunities for me so

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,440
at some point of time during my

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,519
university i managed to get an

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,160
internship at a research institute

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,079
and then uh following that i i landed a

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
final year project that i enjoyed and

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,720
then

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,040
you know that led into graduate studies

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,160
and finally postgraduate and so on

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,519
but at some at um maybe around five

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,279
years into my post-grad

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,160
i um decided to make a bit of a visit

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,920
and instead of focusing on doing

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,399
research i decided to

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,399
move into the education field and

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,079
there were a couple of things that

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,680
wanted me to make this change

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,199
um the first one was the fact that i

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,399
became a mother

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,240
and i wanted to uh it was it was very

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,759
important for me that my kids grew up in

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
an environment where uh

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,399
education was moving very fast and stem

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,639
education was something that

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,000
um changed so in the olden days when we

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,639
were studying science when we were

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
studying

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
computing and you literally had to do

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
things where

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,959
you know the question and the exam paper

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
would be name the three parts of a

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,160
computer and and you would have to say

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
the three parts of the computer are the

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,199
monitor

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,399
um the cpu and the keyboard i do not

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,320
know how many of you belong to the

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,320
generation

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
so so literally that that's how it used

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,040
to be and and of course today

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
um things are very different and you

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
have

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,279
tools out there that enables

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,400
anybody um to learn how to code

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,959
and to get involved in tech and

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,559
one of the tools and i think i think

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,400
that this is something that i would i

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,240
always like to say that my

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,880
daughter my younger daughter learned how

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,480
to code before she learns how to read

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,280
wow that is and and it's not so much of

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
the

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,640
ability of a child you know and

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,000
sometimes oh your daughter is smart but

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
that's not true it's the fact that there

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,919
are tools available today

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,120
to make it accessible to someone that's

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
very young and i was

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,440
totally fascinated by that idea and

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
what was lacking was the fact that

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
you know while there are tools available

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
people are not aware of these tools

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
someone needs to go out and tell parents

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,919
because we are we as parents

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,520
we as women okay coding

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
i am supposed to be doing assembly

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,640
language and you know that that's kind

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,559
of what people have in mind you know

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,240
um pages and pages of jargon and

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,679
hexadecimal numbers that

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,840
that make no sense to anybody but that's

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,679
not what it is so so that's

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,880
sort of how i pivoted and now i just

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
want to um

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,160
bring out a couple of things that struck

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
a chord with me based on what sherry had

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,200
shared a little bit earlier

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,679
on uh specifically on women and

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,520
uh early when i was a staff at the

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,440
science center i had the pleasure of

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,039
hosting a hackathon that was run by a

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,000
bunch of students

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,400
um and they were trying to do some um

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
work

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,960
on hacking um old electronics to make

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,080
cool stuff i mean students love to do

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,000
projects like this

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,919
it was a student fronted project and

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
this boy whom we had known had got

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
together all his friends and said you

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
know we would like to use the science

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,720
center

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,080
sure and uh what struck me was that out

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,840
of that group were 25

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
students who were part of this hackathon

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,880
there were two girls

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,240
and um that they they had a lot of fun

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,360
the students were had a lot of fun i was

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,440
observing them

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
and at the end of it this the kids were

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,000
doing reflections

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
and the girls stood up one of the girls

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,039
stood up

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,840
and she was almost crying and she said

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,440
ever since i was a child i had never had

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,039
the opportunity to build

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,760
anything i have never played with legos

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,559
um i had never built anything and today

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,679
i built

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,960
this she was maybe about 15 16 a give or

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,919
take there

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,679
and i stopped and i said what's

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,919
happening here you know um

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,600
15 16 year old girl in a generally good

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,320
school in singapore never had had the

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,600
opportunity to build anything before

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,039
and um so then then uh sometime later i

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,559
watched this video which i think has

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,280
been floating around in social media

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,320
quite a bit

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,240
where there is a girl child who is

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,880
growing up and as the child is growing

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,360
up

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
uh things happen in the way we speak to

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,600
that child

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,760
you know hey princess how are you don't

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,400
touch that big tool let your dad handle

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
it

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,640
and and these things make very

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,320
subtle it's not that as a parent

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,000
we don't want our children to go into

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,400
engineering it's just that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,280
as a parent from the very very early

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,520
ages

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,880
we have these little biases that

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,120
implicitly

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
sort of feed into our kids that you know

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,320
i'm a girl i should be

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,280
not doing i don't know what so

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,760
so these are things that i think uh i i

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,679
think

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
i really want to change and that's kind

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
of why i am where i am and i think i'm

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
going to hand the time over before i

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,320
start talking too much

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
this is super inspiring doctor uh you

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,559
know you you talk about the importance

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,760
of

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,000
advocacy so many people just are not

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,480
aware of the opportunities out there for

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,640
that shift and that change in this arena

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,760
so thank you continue to champion that

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
and i really really

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,880
love your story about girls i you know i

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,039
just had

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
this impression we did digital goals in

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,559
sri lanka

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,559
and when we look into the eyes of some

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,120
of these kids they're like oh you know

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,039
exactly the expressions that you just

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,559
articulated about how

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,200
you know they've never built something

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,360
now that they've experimented it

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,360
they think that wow actually i can do it

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,760
i have much bigger dreams

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,520
and i really want to be there helping

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,200
the other girls helping the other

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,280
you know people who has never touched a

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,760
computer was never coded

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,919
uh so i love your inspirational story

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,039
and it is super important

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,280
uh for us not to put that conditional

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,120
you know lens uh on our community

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,159
especially as parents spot on you know

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,720
sometimes we

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,360
put that unconscious bias and that

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
condition

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,960
on thank you for that it's super

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,400
inspiring and uh

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
maybe let's turn to han

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
hope

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,919
as for me uh i must confess that uh

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,080
i'm not a type person i i have been

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,679
working in my whole career as an

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,720
anthropologist with

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,120
very limited knowledge on text but what

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,280
what has been really inspiring me

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:11,200
and and then to begin to explore these

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,919
these stories is uh

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,600
so i mean i i've been working most of my

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,240
career in the country sector

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,120
and in the country sector we face a lot

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
of challenges

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,039
and i guess you all know it there's like

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,840
artists and heritage professionals have

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,720
very low

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,200
and unstable income there are very

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,120
little resources to support them country

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,000
sector is a very poor sector

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,799
if i must tell you all the ministries on

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the ngos working on kancho are generally

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
very poor artists

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
are often struggling they are very

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,679
limited

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,280
opportunities for networking with other

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,720
people to receive new skills

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,159
to to learn new things we see with our

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,200
own eyes heritage

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,000
being damaged at a very fast speed

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,919
and then if you are from the consumer

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,200
users point of view

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,360
you also have certain limited access

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,480
i mean you would have access to more

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,039
mainstream

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,960
country products for example than the

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,320
products are produced by

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,960
more marginalized indigenous groups

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,320
and then when corvid took place started

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
about a year ago

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,280
we see all these challenges are getting

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,520
worsening very very fast

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,320
and at the same time we also see that

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,039
how fast the country sector start using

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,360
digital technology to maneuver and to

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
try to make the sector better to gain a

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,640
little bit more

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,559
income by putting things online and

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
things like that so

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,240
so that's when we really see that okay

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
there's maybe there could be a great

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,880
ways to bring the

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,120
partners from the country from the

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,360
technology wants and also bring new

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,919
business models in to really

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,760
explore something to make the country

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,039
sector a better place for for

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,720
for everyone to be so

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:07,679
because of that we initiated this uh

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,000
initiative contact car take for country

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,960
but then if you say it is like tackle

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,279
the digital are the challenges that that

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,200
faced by the sector so with this we aim

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,120
to provide a platform

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,120
for all these different partners from

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,200
different sectors to come together

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,880
to learn from each other to network to

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,039
build capacity

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,240
and to develop solutions to support the

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,279
country sector

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,679
so we started with this first idea tone

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,760
very great honor to partner with ford's

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,400
asia for the first idea ton

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,159
uh and we we we see some interesting

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
interesting figures i was going to give

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,400
you so when we did the

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,919
what we did the the idea tone day when

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:54,320
krutika actually gave a very seminal

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,360
workshop so we have 443 participants

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,120
joined and

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,159
half of them are women

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
about fifty percent uh now forty percent

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,360
of them are young they are at the

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,559
student's background

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,880
and uh they come from 31 countries

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,640
some of them are from areas that we

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
could consider kind of

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,000
a bit of the frontier in the technology

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,880
ones like

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,640
bangladesh mongolia nepal uzbekistan

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
and then people come from backgrounds

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,640
like kancho they are artists actresses

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,640
curator film producer tour guides they

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,000
come from technology site

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,080
software cloud engineer web developer

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,159
and they they come they are students

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,919
professors

00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,080
researchers entrepreneurs government

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,559
officers so we really see a very

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,120
diverse range of people and so we are

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,559
kind of

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,400
also very hopeful that how with this

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,279
approach that we are taking by bringing

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,760
different sectors together we can

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,720
kind of encourage this inclusivity and

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,960
diversity

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,159
for the tech world but of course also

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,120
for our culture

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
country sector as well so that's that's

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,679
how

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,320
we kaijab started and it's still a very

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,640
early process in terms of unesco

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,760
uh in the power session we are also

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,320
having other

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,919
other activities at the global level or

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
looking at ai

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,400
uh and especially like yeah so i am very

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,919
excited to hear about the the

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,640
uni um microsoft uh initiative on women

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,000
and ai

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,960
because we we also found very much of

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the same evidence that you have just

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
stated earlier so yeah so so that was

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,440
the process that

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,520
unesco is working on with experts to

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,240
develop recommendations

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,559
for ethics in ai and a lot of that was

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,440
one of the main principles is related to

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,320
inclusion and diversity

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,000
very very very nice thank you han you

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
know you talk about how hey i'm

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
working all my life and culture and not

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,840
really in tech

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,120
uh but honestly you know we have a

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,480
satellite say

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,360
that you know culture eats strategy for

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,320
breakfast

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,760
so culture is so much so such an

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,559
important fabric of

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,039
you know our society and something that

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,840
uh

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,159
uh you know as we as every one of us

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
make

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,880
choices you know this this basically

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,320
builds a culture and the culture

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,240
basically shapes our world

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,520
so thank you first thank you for the

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
passion and the work that you've been

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,399
doing

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,919
and in this arena especially when you

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,320
talk about hey you know

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,919
uh we work with farmers in the rural

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,440
area who are not very exposed to

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,080
technology

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,200
who has very little economic actually

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
opportunity

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,440
uh this is really the era where we're

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,080
gonna open up technology platform

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,880
to give them two things right one

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,720
technology to ai and technology to help

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
uh the farmers increase their

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,240
productivity increase their ability

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,080
to drive more sustainable production but

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
more importantly with technology now

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,360
they can have

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,720
an openness to the whole marketplace to

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,279
the whole ecosystem

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,960
so your work in the respective culture i

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,320
mean this is about farmers

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,120
the same thing goes for fashion

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
designers for artists they do not need

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,559
to be

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,039
limited to a small physical constraint

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,440
of

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,520
pretty much where they can sell or

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,000
market their products and solutions

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,760
but pretty much open you know the whole

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,679
global ecosystem to them

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,480
so thank you continue to champion that

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,640
work uh maybe let's hear from uh

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,640
hong

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,240
yes um so um my journey to

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,679
to take uh to be on it i got a little

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,279
bit unrelated to um

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,480
what kirutika said about um access to

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,559
tooling

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,080
so i actually did not get into tech

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,960
until um

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,679
i was 20. yes you know i grew up in

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,279
vietnam and

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,720
you said even the people who live

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,840
singapore feel that they don't get

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,039
access to the right to

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,600
end country like vietnam or india

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,559
evenly more difficult at the time when i

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,760
grew up

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,520
but i got um into tech i must say again

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,520
even though i said it so many times in

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,399
every conversation it's all about open

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,399
source

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,480
so um my first interaction with um

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,960
with open source was at the time when i

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,720
did a translation freelance job in a

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,039
conference where we talked about

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,880
free technology and where i also met my

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,480
my partner paul mario

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,880
who explained to me open source and

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,080
after that i got the initial idea i

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,200
started to

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,919
um connect with the local linux user

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,080
group

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,600
yeah i went to submit up at that time i

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
remember that they did like

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,120
every class they're meeting where they

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,159
show people how to install different

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,440
like ubuntu os or linux mint in in the

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,080
in their machine

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
and i get to uh to the roof i start to

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,120
um

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,799
connect with them and i realize that

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,200
people in that group are just so

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,200
fascinated about what they are doing

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
at one point when i come there i never

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,840
have like tech backdrop before but when

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,200
i come there

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,240
i remember one member sat down with me

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
for three hours

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,480
explained to me how to use the terminal

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
and it got me very excited when you use

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,000
the terminal everything like because

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
it's so very like very fast you can

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,080
download software

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,360
uh so quickly and you can actually see

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,880
you give a comment and something

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,559
happened in the background and it's got

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,279
me very excited

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,000
and of course not only that interaction

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,919
get me into

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,360
tech but several like throughout the

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,600
year um

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,520
of that year i realized that there's so

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
much learning opportunity that

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,799
open source can offer me and whenever i

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,720
meet an open source contributor

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,559
they talk so passionate about what they

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,000
are doing you know i met so many people

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,120
who contribute

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,960
to project for over 20 years and feel so

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,679
excited so when you go to do the

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
workplace

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,960
a lot of things going on and sometimes

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,720
don't get dressed with your work but as

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,880
soon as you ask them to ask about their

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,600
open source project they can talk to you

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,799
hours and hours non-stop and i think

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,519
that this is something that that's

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,080
really

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,600
really cool and open source is not only

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,799
about software it's about open

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,640
collaboration

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,480
with without open source i would not be

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,039
where i am today

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,960
i got uh not only for asia the reason

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,559
why i studied first asia i want to show

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,559
people i want to show women out there

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,360
that actually opportunity

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,480
there's so much knowledge so much

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,720
resources

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,240
in this like tech world that people

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,760
willing to share

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,640
and it can empower you to um

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,559
to grow your your own career um even i

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,360
did not study in tech i'm now working

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,840
fully

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,559
in tech industry and also got like some

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
uh

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,600
i would say a proud achievement because

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,760
i

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,080
made post asia sustainable uncertainty

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,799
over so many years and i got invited to

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,799
join

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,159
the board of director of the open source

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,919
initiative this is

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,600
the organization that safeguard the

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,320
definition of open source

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,240
based in the u.s and i also got invited

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,159
on the board of

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,000
open source business alliance because

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,720
they actually want to hear

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,919
want to understand the perspective of um

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,279
of women

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,559
and uh i also recently got uh

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,679
appointed to join the ipoe standard

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,799
association so all these opportunities

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,919
would not come uh if i

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,240
have not made my way into the um

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,360
tech industry and open source community

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
in the first place

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,399
and i also want to to to second what

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,720
hadn't said earlier

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
in the hackathon that we organized a few

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,880
months ago

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,200
so we see women coming from cambodia

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,440
coming from mongolia places

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,039
that really difficult to accept coming

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,679
from myanmar

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,240
but that the current time is changing so

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,720
much so

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
internet had enabled us to do many

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,000
things that we could not imagine

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,440
before and um software technology is not

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,279
only about coding it was

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,159
good because there's so many potential

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,480
for us and i really think that it the

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,600
conversation is really important it also

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,000
a pathway um the um

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,120
the approach to raise awareness to more

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,919
people

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,679
um sorry if i imagine wanted to mention

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,919
one one more program of foundation that

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,600
we're doing because we also contribute

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,320
into this uh journey by organizing our

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,320
own

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,240
uh coding program kohi we've been

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,640
running this program for

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,159
many years already so the whole idea is

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
to get mentors

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,159
the people like more senior in in the

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,360
community to help the younger

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,519
students and developers to contribute to

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,360
to open source and learn a new skill

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,799
and last month i think just last month

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
our last season we got two

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,240
women winners in the room so every

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,480
season

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,799
every time we have uh three plain rice

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,120
uh winners and the last one we have

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,320
two women coming from from india and i'm

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,600
very proud

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,720
that we um uh encouraged

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,880
and and engaged more uh female

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,960
student and young developers into open

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,960
source

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,559
i'm super super inspired you're really

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,519
our hero you know here

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,639
it's just amazing to hear how you

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,960
started with an

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,119
innocent approach into a conference

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
tried something and got super excited

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,639
about it

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,119
and then that just paved the way of such

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,480
an

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,480
admirable journey right now and i think

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,919
a lot more people should hear about your

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,399
story and your journey

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,240
and your spot on right um today we are

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,639
in this arena where

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,919
the physical boundaries have all been

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,800
dismantled we have an

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,159
amazing opportunity right now to get

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,960
equal access to

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,560
uh the community out there and i think

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,359
one of the most powerful things that you

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,119
said is

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,720
how it's not just about coding it's

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,560
about open collaboration

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,079
how do we really need to break down the

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,560
wall so that we can

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,720
able and encourage people to collaborate

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,560
make the voice out there very active and

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,399
as women i really think that we have

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,119
such an amazing opportunity

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,520
to be each other's allies you know to to

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,720
help one another and i would also say in

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,599
my experience

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,200
uh maybe just a a a quick opportunity

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,760
also to talk about you know you talk

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,480
about how

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,000
you did not study tech but you're now

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,640
full career in tech

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,359
uh i did not study tech as well i

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,160
started my

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,839
i graduated with a business degree and i

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
started my journey with this company

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,640
called lucent technologies

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,200
uh back then in dos era is the authority

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,920
is the tech you know icon that is

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,240
building

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,280
uh communications network internet

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,160
backbones

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,000
uh switching devices uh signaling

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,720
networks to enable

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you know the mobile and physical uh data

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,560
communications

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,640
so i got into that role uh lucen

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,640
basically starting to do proposals i'm

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,880
just putting proposals together

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,839
but i really have an appetite to kind of

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,240
like in

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,079
digest all types of information so i

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,960
read and read and read and read and

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,520
learn

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,280
uh i just want to say that that really

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,599
kick-start my journey into tech

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,640
and one of the biggest thing and i think

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,720
kiwita said that very well is

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,160
you know don't put the limitations i

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,560
really did not start

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,839
you know my school days on engineering

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,920
topics but today

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,040
i'm very deep into technology into the

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,119
architecture

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,720
and know more importantly how the

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,400
systems of work and how

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,880
technology can make a difference for

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,119
people's lives and our society

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,640
so that is super powerful and i

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,560
encourage all the women out there

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,839
do not put a constraint do not put a

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,520
lead for yourself

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,119
uh you have many airlines out there

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,839
who's willing to help and support your

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,480
journey

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,960
and more importantly you know uh what

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
han

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,160
and hong is doing to create that open

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,000
platform where

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,640
women from all over the world you know

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,320
can actually have an opportunity to code

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,800
have an opportunity to

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,440
uh uh dabble into the tech world the

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
world

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,520
that is in the making today is super

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,680
digital right digital is going to be

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,280
every part of it i i would think one of

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,119
the biggest thing is about courage

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,800
taking that courage that first step just

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,480
like what home did

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,400
and more importantly having that

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,119
continuous growth mindset

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,119
always wanting to acquire more

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,800
information and with open system there's

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,960
a lot of knowledge out there that you

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,040
can freely uh acquire

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
uh so with that maybe let me just turn

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,079
uh in the interest of time uh to a

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,320
second question

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,079
you're doing a lot of things out there

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,160
like like it than not the reality

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,760
is there are still a lot of work for us

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,480
in the arena of diversity

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,599
and inclusion uh like to hear what are

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,480
the barriers

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,880
uh that you actually experience the

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,440
biases and the discrimination

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,200
and maybe some of the good success of

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,200
how you overcome those challenges

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:51,839
i don't know han hong dr kirititha

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,839
okay maybe i'll go first okay um

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,440
i think when we talk about challenges

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,000
uh there there are actually two

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,440
challenges which i think we face

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,760
that gets people not necessarily women

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
but

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,760
everyone away from technology and i

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,880
think

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,920
somewhere we need to address these two

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,280
issues the first of course i think i

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
mentioned this right at the beginning is

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,720
that this is too hard for me

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,760
um now we all know that technology is

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,160
important

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,079
we all know that we can't none of us can

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,800
live without our smartphones we have

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,040
four more

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,320
fear of missing out if we live without

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,839
our smartphones

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,200
um but we don't think that we have the

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,280
ability to create

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,800
with the technology that we have in our

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,560
hands we want to be consumers because

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
again a bit of a plug towards what we do

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,800
at the science center we always believe

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,680
that um everyone should be a creator of

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,800
tech

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,960
and not a consumer of tech and many of

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,680
the stuff that we do is actually geared

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
towards

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,200
bringing up that kind of a mentality and

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,400
uh

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,920
it's it's doable and of course again the

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,839
tools that are available

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,599
that amazing set of tools that are

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,280
available to that that helps us to make

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,800
this happen right

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,079
the other thing which is also a little

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,720
bit concerning to me

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,320
is not that it's too hard but should i

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,680
do it

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,359
and the question comes because

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,119
uh but when we really think about it

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,560
right uh i feel that there's a bit of an

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,560
80s mentality

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:36,400
um you know uh so okay i'm not

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,680
a coder i'm not an engineer why should i

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,400
learn how to code with python

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,920
for example right is it is it even

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,240
relevant to me

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,280
and then if we if we kind of again take

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,640
a step back again

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,200
i did say that none of us can live with

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,800
our smartphones but at the same time

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,400
um you know can i just think of any job

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,599
you know open open thing where

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,800
technology does not help us

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,440
um let's consider say farming

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,640
defined this is the most lowest tech job

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,880
that you would think of

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,640
and it's been around for but we all know

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,119
and every day we read newspaper articles

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,440
about

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,920
how farming is going high-tech you know

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,839
people are using iot and robotics and

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,200
farm bots you know to get your

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,640
your um farming easy and of course to to

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,119
solve certain challenges in

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,640
in the farming community as well let's

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,960
think about

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,640
carpentry for example all right so when

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,560
you're a carpenter do you need to

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,079
do you need to use technology i mean all

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,800
i'm doing is cutting wood and screwing

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,400
it together

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,480
um what what do i need to know how to

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,839
code for and i just recently read this

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,240
article about this um

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,240
indian guy who who actually is a

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,000
carpenter who makes bespoke furniture

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,960
and he's using augmented reality to make

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,760
his furniture

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
more interesting and enhancing and and

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,319
really if you think of

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,480
any job in the world you know

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,680
human resources i heard a story about

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,079
how um

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,680
i can't remember if it was shoppi or or

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,200
some other company where they're

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,200
using they're hiring hr people who need

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,720
to know how to do big data analysis

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,800
because they need to crawl linkedin to

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,040
find headhunts to headhunt people

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,880
so so really every job needs text so

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,280
don't tell me that

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,040
i'm not working in technology you are

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,000
working in technology regardless of what

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,720
you do and tech

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,760
can help us to to make and do our job

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,720
better

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,319
and i think that is one of the biggest

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,240
challenges that we need to address it's

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,920
not teaching technology to technology

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,720
people it's teaching technology to

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,160
people who

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,400
who don't who feel that they don't need

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,599
to do technology and to me that's a

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,119
little bit synonymous

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,119
to say in the early 90s you know

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,359
uh people used to go for courses to

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,480
learn how to use microsoft word

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,560
um and and you had to be

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,040
have a certificate in typing or you know

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,720
certificate in this to get hired and

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,720
nowadays nobody bothers with stuff like

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,079
this and i think maybe two three years

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,359
down the road nobody's going to bother

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,960
with whether you are a

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,400
micro certificate in python you're

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,319
supposed to have it i'm sorry

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,079
it's like reading and writing you just

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,839
have to do it you know so

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,920
yeah so that's that's what i wanted to

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,920
share

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,440
absolutely absolutely i love the fact

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,720
that you're talking about everyone

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,880
should be a creator

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,920
and with the tools and the technology on

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,520
our hands

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,680
uh the perception that uh you know

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,359
i can't do it this is one of the biggest

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,319
challenge absolutely and thank you for

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,480
continuing to

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:32,880
advocate that um how about home

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,480
yes so i just want to uh to continue

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,960
what cute you guys said

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,720
yes okay kilograms uh i totally agree

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,280
with you kiro so

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,800
um technology i think all the industry

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,640
would benefit from

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,079
technology and everyone should learn and

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,839
it's all about

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,480
the mindset from the beginning if we

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,280
have more models like you who encourage

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,040
their children

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,319
right from the start that would be so

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,599
good right so we need to do

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,520
more advocacy more hours

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,680
but another thing that i see as a

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,400
challenge i work with many

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,960
um corporations many many companies and

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,640
i also see that the ratio

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,760
in career development on the leadership

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,720
level so you still see a lot of men like

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,480
um

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,319
have uh uh it seems like so

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,240
you if you look at report from from the

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,599
industry there's still a lot of

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,800
um men that holding emotional opposition

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,960
in incorporation and of course i i

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,480
i'm pretty glad to see that microsoft

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,359
doing a lot

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,560
into this uh direction as sherry only um

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,359
shared earlier

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,640
and i also see so i um besides we this

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,160
is the first time i got to

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,079
do the mastering but before that i've

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,839
been working several years with

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,800
a sinho and i just see that as sinho

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,240
is a good like a role model a way for

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,160
people looking at women can

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,680
also advance in in their career and

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,079
there's opportunity

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,720
in the leadership from for women and

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,520
this has

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,319
been the society have been moving a lot

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,119
of pressure

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,640
and raise awareness across the industry

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,040
and companies started to

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,480
to make good effort to change this and

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,920
this is something that we

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,599
very happy about yeah so

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,599
connect to that i want to say that we

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,160
need more role models

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,040
so we need uh women to inspire other

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,240
women

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,839
and this is a uh this is great to have

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,119
the panel for discussion so that

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:33,280
companies out there take this as

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:36,400
an example and do more make more effort

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,040
uh similar to microsoft 3a environment

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
when

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,280
women feel comfortable you mentioned

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,640
about you have the program for

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,240
um women in in ai right

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,200
so if you look at asian landscape a lot

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,079
of

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,240
of countries they have the pacific

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,119
culture that make humans they tend not

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,079
to be so

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,560
comfortable to to be around men so we

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,480
have

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,680
if we if we could create an environment

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,800
like specifically

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,640
for women make them feel comfortable

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,400
doing what they are doing it also enjoy

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,119
opportunity

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,880
for me um like in the in the force

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,920
community of course i

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,040
i did not uh luckily i did not

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,119
experience discrimination while working

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,480
with the first asia community but i also

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,680
heard a story

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,400
uh from other people and at the end it's

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,480
all about

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,079
um the mis perception misunderstanding

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,040
because the way

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,640
some people communicate might not be

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,119
served as appropriate to some other

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,160
people

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,160
so the cultural sector cultural factors

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,480
i also see is as a barrier and this is

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,200
something that we

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,000
need to uh tackle as well and this is

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,800
linked to

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,240
duhan who's really an expert uh in

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,079
cultural and you perhaps

00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,280
you know i'm really inspiring to see all

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,920
the

00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,400
team members in your office actually

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,440
women coming from everywhere perhaps you

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,839
can

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,119
jim in and and share with us the story

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,800
there yeah

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,040
thank you thank you hong folk and yeah i

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,839
completely agree with the challenges

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,119
that hong kong

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:16,079
and kirutika had just mentioned and

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,720
uh previously sherry as well uh and

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,960
before

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,119
uh just very quickly i would like to

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,680
point out to the links that my colleague

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,800
misako ito just put in on the

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,119
on the chat there about a video of

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,400
the link to a video that unesco has made

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,520
on gender and ai

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,040
so maybe after the panel you are very

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,680
welcome to have a look

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,960
uh and uh so in terms of challenges i'm

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,480
gonna shift gear a bit

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,000
uh of course here we we hear the

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,839
challenges about how women

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,480
can uh yeah uh in relation to tech and

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,200
i would like to maybe bringing maybe the

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,200
the

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,640
challenges for people who are not the

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,119
tech people but now

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,520
as you see everything is digital now you

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,599
cannot really miss the trend anymore

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,359
because i mean if you are not on it and

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,800
you would be very behind

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:08,160
and we have already seen how technology

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,160
has made great implications for cultural

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,920
and artistic expressions

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,160
you start seeing ai producing artwork i

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,480
think you will all know about this

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,599
artwork the next rembrandt i think

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,280
microsoft was involved as well right so

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,119
so and and eventually i mean if um

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,040
i think it's a great experiment by the

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,079
way but then it also raised certain

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,400
questions

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,160
about future of the arts whether a human

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,520
would be making it or we will be having

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,160
machine making it

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,520
and then also rice and remuneration of

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,680
artists as well

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,599
and so if everything was being put in

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,480
the hand of the tech and so what would

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,400
be the

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,319
for the country sector what would our

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,040
artists what would our heritage

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,200
professional

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,480
have the role in it so i think the

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,040
access to

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,680
for the country sector and and with this

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,240
i

00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,640
i i think would be equal early important

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,640
for agriculture sector for health sector

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,319
for all these other sectors as well not

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,040
not just the country sector

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,359
uh to how to to have access to all these

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,000
tech

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,640
opportunities how they can also be

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,680
trained

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,760
in all these tech skills uh of course i

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,760
mean if they had opportunities to learn

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,319
stem from their young age and later if

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,079
they come

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,640
become an artist or they become a

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,640
heritage person they already have that

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,040
same knowledge in them but then

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,920
a lot of the countries do not have

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,240
opportunity

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,160
to offer stems to young young young

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,160
children and so they would grow up they

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,000
would become artists they are struggling

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,960
because at his own struggle

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,720
and then they have to try to maneuver on

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,520
this digital wall and if they are not

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,680
fast enough

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,680
and then some tech person would come in

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,240
and run away with it right so

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,720
so how to really provide access to the

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,640
country sector or to any outside sector

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,359
to learn about all these skills and

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,920
knowledge

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,240
about all these financial opportunities

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,079
on the infrastructure and equipment

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,160
and more importantly i think the

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,640
opportunity to really work with the tech

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,640
people

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,559
because at the end of the day it's not

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,200
really you compete country sector

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,359
compete

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,680
with tech sector to see who would

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,160
produce the nicest artwork right but i

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,599
think

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,119
the the the future i think is i really

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,280
would like to see the stronger

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,960
collaboration between the sector

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,119
and who provide these kinds of

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,440
collaboration because to be honest for

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,280
me

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,720
as a country person when i look at all

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,720
these topics that hong kong is

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,880
organizing under this summit a lot of

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,280
them look like foreign language to me

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,800
because i'm not really a part of this

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,000
world you know and i would

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,760
i could say that probably 99.9

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,480
the people in the country sector would

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,400
feel the same way so where do we start

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,720
begin to pave the way to start including

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,720
other people they would never replace

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,359
the tech people that's for sure but then

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,359
how

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,119
how they can start beginning the the

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,839
common language so that they can work

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,520
together

00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,520
with the tech people so i think that

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,160
that is a something that we would really

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,839
like to explore further

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,520
this is super exciting i feel like we

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,240
got so much to talk about but

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,800
unfortunately time is running out

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,079
uh so maybe just a pause of a second and

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
i want to sum up you know

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,280
all the great uh insights that our

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,480
panelists have

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,920
uh provided uh any questions from the

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,599
public chat group um that we need to

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,599
address

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,880
yes siri i think that we have a number

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,119
of questions do you see

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,559
um also the share notes i saw quite a

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,839
number of questions

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:36,400
already uh somehow

00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,400
oh yeah

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,000
shall we think maybe one two questions

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,000
um

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:48,960
let's see i'm super super excited given

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,200
we have so much great insight from here

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,200
um

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:57,200
i am scrolling through the chat

00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,480
sherry so it in and the share knows the

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,200
question so if you see

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,119
um on the left side you see notes and

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,119
there is the option share notes

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,800
people putting have been putting their

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,800
question inside there

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,960
oh yeah okay got it

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,079
so how about you every you know a lot of

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,119
question on

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,920
diversity half of young moments like i

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,599
think we can

00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:25,440
yes very um yeah i think that is

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,960
one or two yeah yeah so um

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,680
people keep typing but i think there is

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,839
an easy one we can start first

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,880
there are so many technologies i do not

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,720
know how to start

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,800
what do you recommend for students who

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:40,160
are in school

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,160
ah that's a good question for kimu yeah

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,880
yeah that's my favorite question thank

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,880
you for asking

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,920
um well so um for

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,559
for students who are in school there is

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,440
a suite

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,319
now and the suite is a growing suite um

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,880
so there is

00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,680
um it's certainly not an exhaustive list

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,680
so for for

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,520
starting how to code uh i think there

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,280
are a couple of platforms um

00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,800
my favorite one for the very very young

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,160
kids the four-year-old uh

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:13,280
in us is actually microsoft's kodu

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,640
um platform which is a little um very

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,839
visual programming things and my

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,000
daughter actually

00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,359
learned her first code in codus k that's

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,240
k-u-d-u

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,240
um and then um there is the the more the

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,960
open source um option so we've got

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,480
scratch

00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,960
which is from mit uh media lab very

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,000
commonly used in schools to to teach

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,400
kids how to

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,839
um get started in coding um as well as

00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,079
computational thinking

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,040
um there is also so when we talk about

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,359
coding we also

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,480
should not um sort of ignore the

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,800
hardware um

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,599
options that are around there as well so

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,079
um

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,240
my favorite boards in that order is

00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,839
actually the maki maki which is a very

00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,200
simple board to interface

00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,440
um any kind of code to a physical

00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,559
environment and that really excites kids

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,160
um we have the microbit which is really

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,839
grown in popularity over the last three

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,240
to four years

00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,680
and then following that we have the

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,720
arduino

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,240
program there are a lot of block-based

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,000
coding

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,839
opportunities where you actually can

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,160
code without coding in that sense

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,400
without really like writing any syntax

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,839
um other than scratch uh and and the

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,079
block based um

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,880
environments have actually moved very

00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,119
far

00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,319
um so something like scratch can only

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,440
get you to a

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:33,920
toy um product in a sense

00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
uh but there are tools like um thunkable

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,480
my favorite is actually

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,000
kabul thunkable is actually an app

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,400
development environment and the end of

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,880
the day you can actually do a functional

00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,440
app that you can export onto an android

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,079
uh

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,839
phone and distribute it so that you know

00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,079
you can share your app with your friends

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,440
and

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,319
and literally anyone can um can use

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,839
thunkable

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,000
um so so there are really many tools

00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,800
here

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
just so much and i i just sorry it uh we

00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,280
have three more minutes

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,760
and i wanted to yes i'm close

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,319
but before i go there you know i would

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,400
say go to lincoln.com right that is a

00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,520
whole series of what we call digital

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,559
foundations

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,720
and to uh hans point everybody needs to

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,000
um kind of like embrace tag doesn't

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,559
matter if you are artist

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,359
or your taxi driver or you know your

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,880
teacher

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,960
so i would encourage you to go to

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,839
lincoln.com by giving a lot of free

00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,240
courses

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:31,200
uh basically and you get certified so

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:34,319
you get a journey into tag not just

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:37,040
not just awareness and no knowledge

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,880
and also watch out for maybe my linkedin

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,119
where we're going to publish a very very

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,280
large initiative called women in ai

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,720
we're giving skilling certification

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,960
program for free

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,319
uh to encourage women and i you know

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,640
there's a very very good

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,640
question on the panel uh on the lease

00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,119
for all our parents to close with it

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,200
says

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,559
what is the one change you want to see

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,200

00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,079
practical uh so i love to hear from that

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,240
for myself

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,119
the one thing i want to see now is the

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,240
rights of women

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,319
in ai because it starts to graze point

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,799
you know from the development phase if

00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,760
we are able to release a large pool of

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,400
women in

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,480
into the tech world uh you're gonna see

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,559
a change in the end product that is

00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,960
that's designed you're gonna change and

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,440
