hi everyone

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,160
i'm manu dasari senior project manager

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,519
and agile consultant with thoughtworks

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,719
i'm here to talk about hyperagility

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,039
being a smart enterprise

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
now let me ask you how many of you

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
actually use

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,199
agile practices today along with

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,560
artificial intelligence and

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,920
automation a show of hands for those

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,519
interested you could also

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,800
scan in the qr code on the screen

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,600
for putting in your inputs in a short

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,200
survey as well

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,559
now based on what i have seen

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,600
in the past i would say not many

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,559
now this is sad given that hyper

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
automation

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,760
is one of the latest trends from gartner

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
which combines automation and

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,160
intelligence

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,840
and i would define hyperagility

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,520
as augmenting automation with artificial

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,799
intelligence

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,200
to the agile practices

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,920
how does this all work let us take a

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
scenario

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
for example meet pete he's a product

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
owner for

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
a financial services business and he

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,439
would like to create a web platform

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,240
solution for his customers

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,640
now he's never done user stories before

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
and he's new to the agile ways of

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
working

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
now pete takes a long time to brainstorm

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,799
his user stories

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
and to come up with the priorities for

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,479
his backlog as he doesn't

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,600
have the right data insights

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
to make the right decisions so how can

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,560
we help peat

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,680
peas can use hyperagility in

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
various examples for example in the

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,520
first one

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
there can be intelligent user

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,079
storyboards

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,960
that help pete to augment

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,759
his everyday activities during the

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,680
discovery

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,439
and inception phases of the agile

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,640
project life cycle

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,599
by giving helpful hints for the user

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,800
stories

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,480
something like google

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,440
secondly he could also have

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
machine bots that help with the auto

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,520
grooming

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,360
of the product backlog with priority

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,160
suggestions based on the data analytics

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,680
that is integrated and delivered

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,800
to the product backlog thirdly

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,000
he could also integrate his devops

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
dashboards

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
with the real-time mining of the

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,480
customer data insights

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,760
to identify the value delivered

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,200
now pete benefits with hyper agility

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,120
because he has improved productivity as

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,760
is able to come up with the breadth of

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
user stories prompted by the intelligent

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,760
bots

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,319
he has better access to data and is

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,800
able to prioritize the stories in his

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,760
backlog based on the customer inside

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
suggestions

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,400
by the intelligent boards and more

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,319
importantly his company has improved roi

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
with the optimized deployment of

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
resources

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,120
it's no surprise that pete benefits from

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,400
hyper agility

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,720
in fact nine out of the ten ai leaders

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,319
are advanced in data management

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,360
and 74 percent of them who are

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,239
planning to implement these are

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
having sophisticated data management

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
systems plan in place

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,040
to be done by 2023 according to a

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
benchmarking study of over 1200

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
companies

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,200
now what's next does it mean humans will

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,799
be replaced by robots not really they

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,439
will be augmented uh by robots

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
for better productivity so what tools

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,120
can be tapped

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,239
you can refer to the thoughtworks

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
looking class

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
which provides a list of trends that you

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,080
can watch out for

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,720
and best practices to adopt and what

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,880
does it mean for my business

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,880
you can explore how artificial

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,400
intelligence and automation

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,520
may join your mainstream agile practices

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
in the next five years now

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,759
this is a snippet of the thoughtworks

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,120
looking glass that you can have a

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
reference to that's all for my talk

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
today

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,840
