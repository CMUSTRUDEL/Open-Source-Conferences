hello everyone i'm shiva lamba and i'm

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,200
currently a google summer of code mentor

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,200
at jenkins and cnc foundation

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
the topic of my lightning talk is the

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
rise of open source

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,599
development programs for the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
underrepresented people in

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,680
tech now first of all let's understand

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,320
what exactly is open source

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,600
as it breaks down in two words open and

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
source open meaning that

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,720
it is open for anyone to come in and use

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,119
anyone

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,920
to contribute to it anyone to use it at

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,679
any

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
time without any restrictions on the

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
geography or the

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,040
race or the gender of the person who can

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
contribute to it and source means that

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,680
the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,399
source code of that project or that

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,360
program

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
is completely open sourced that it is

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
completely visible to the public it's

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,719
not closed

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,559
or it's not uh something that is uh paid

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
and usually a lot of the open source

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,520
programs are free as well

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,239
so uh the main idea behind open source

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,239
is that

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,680
anyone can come in and contribute to

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,800
these kind of projects

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,800
anyone can come in and share their ideas

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,720
and that is the impact of open source

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
that it brings in hundreds and thousands

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,439
from of developers from across the world

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,040
to come and contribute to these projects

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,479
and this makes it a global collaboration

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
and uh even small changes to these can

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
impact

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
uh software's that are being used by

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
hundreds and thousands of people so

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,799
anyone who is contributing to open

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
source can really get a lot of

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,840
experience of

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
software development uh and also real

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
world software development practices

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,000
that can help them and again with open

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,560
source being very collaborative

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,880
it is much better in terms of security

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,159
and in terms of getting bugs fixed

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,240
um as compared to closed source software

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
so it's all about collaboration all

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,640
about contributing and anyone can come

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
in

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
and give their suggestions and

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
contribute to the code base of these

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
open source projects makes it very

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
inclusive for everyone

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,520
and that is the reason that we are

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
seeing a rise of open source programs

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
for the underrepresented sections in the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
tech society so when it comes to tech uh

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,920
which is usually

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
made male dominated we have seen the

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,160
rise

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
of the underpresented uh parts of the

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
sector for example like the women in

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
tech or people from the lgbt community

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
or people in color

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,000
uh also coming in now and contributing

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,879
to open source and there is an

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,440
active application for the number of

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,280
users

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,560
uh who contribute to open source

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,040
belonging to these uh

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,720
underpresented sections and uh over time

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
there have been a lot of different

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,160
open source programs that have come up

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,680
and uh are special

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,040
specifically made for the um

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
for the people from the under

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,360
unrepresented sections of the society

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
so one of them being uh the rails girl

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
summer of court

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,360
which uh unfortunately got shut down

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
last year

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
but hopefully it might be advised uh

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,360
again it is it is meant for

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,720
uh the uh people from the underprison uh

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,319
section of the society then we have

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
outreach which is a currently

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,680
going on uh mentorship program that

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
provides uh

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,200
three to four months of internship

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
program with a stipend to a lot of

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
different open source

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
uh projects like mozilla uh and for

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
a lot of different other uh

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,040
organizations where uh people from under

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,959
represented parts of the technology can

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,800
come and contribute to these projects

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,800
then we have the goal script number of

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,319
code and the main idea for all of them

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,080
is to enhance and enable the people from

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
the underprison sector of society to

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
come and contribute to open source

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
projects real world operations projects

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
that are being used

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
by uh by hundreds and thousands of

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,519
millions of people and

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
their main uh advocates like their main

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
goal is to present

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,120
uh the ability for these under uh

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
represented parts of the society to

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,040
come and contribute to these open source

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
programs and learn and again

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
basically to empowering you know the

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,959
developer communities uh with open

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,959
source

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
and that brings up to my end to my talk
