good afternoon i'm christopher and i'd

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,440
like to share with you

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,000
our idea uh about wire collective

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719
workshops at home collective which is

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,920
about

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,440
an initiative developing mixed mode

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,560
cultural workshops and i'd like to share

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,960
with you as well

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
our inspiration for this idea which is

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
the common map

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,039
and online database for rural stories

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
and resources in hong kong so we've been

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,880
mapping out

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
rural stories uh in hong kong and uh

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,880
putting them online as well

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
and we we've been looking at rural

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,640
resources uh

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,120
cultural heritage so just such as plants

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,960
for for dyes or

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
making lanterns um and this is our test

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
for

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
uh like a vr tour of uh the stories that

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
we collected

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,559
and that we drew uh in hong kong

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,520
uh in the rural and back to the idea we

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,960
were looking at

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,680
like the online context in kovit and we

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
think that this

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
will become a new norm and we think that

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
for the cultural sector

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,000
this might be the chance to to increase

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,720
their cultural reach

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
as well and for the cultural sector we

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,439
think that um

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,840
in kobe times uh actually they uh

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
are affected because their their income

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,759
is suspended

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,400
due to uh less uh and probably no

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
uh cultural tourists uh visiting them

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
which is like their main source of

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
income

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
the the workshops and um

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
so we think that uh work for our

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,320
collective we try to bridge this

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
uh and we think that mixed mode cultural

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,240
workshops could be a way

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
out of this and could be a like a new

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,360
norm

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,399
after this copied so what there is

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,079
for this idea is that firstly uh there

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,119
will be a 360

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,759
virtual tour like on the right now and

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,360
uh we think that there uh should be like

00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,920
uh for the cultural workshops there

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,200
should be an

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
instructional video uh for for the

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,840
workshop

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
and for for how to do uh the the skills

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,239
as well

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,520
and with the the kit uh delivered to you

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,720
um based on the

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,200
the uh logistics networks and

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
uh so we think that this is like uh it

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,080
could be a new

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,879
way of learning about cultural heritage

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,760
and having the the sets delivered to you

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,760
to your doorstep

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,640
and we think that this idea impacts uh

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,720
on a few ways uh in the field layers um

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
the first is that it alleviates

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,920
um the the income problem

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,280
uh for the cultural sector and uh

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,720
brings together the the public

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,879
as well and it also

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
facilitates cultural exchange throughout

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,640
the region

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,959
because if the the workshops are not

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
held at locally at that place it means

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
that

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,959
uh if it can be delivered every anywhere

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,319
else

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,440
that means that uh it it is a regional

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,080
cultural exchange

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
rather than just local having people uh

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
uh

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
visiting that place and as well we think

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,879
that it could

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,480
equalize access to cultural heritage

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,599
because you don't need to fly there

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,720
uh in person i can actually sit at home

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,799
uh to reach a cultural heritage and we

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,920
also think that it could uh bridge

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
uh rural and and urban areas as well

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:45,519
and so that's all thank you very much

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,519
