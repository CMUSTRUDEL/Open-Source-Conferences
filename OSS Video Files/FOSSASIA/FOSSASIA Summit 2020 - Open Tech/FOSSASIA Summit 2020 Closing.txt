can you hear can you hear me now yes so

00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,809
of course big thing to do to the team I

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,920
understand and the situation changing so

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,139
quickly

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,420
excited we can be there but we managed

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,420
to make it happen to think to to you

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:29,910
Roland to Dan Moscow mr. Giri Ted

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:32,910
Ambrose Eden Bella sunshine and I said

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,040
search here order to volunteers that

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,430
mean happy because without you of course

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,320
the event has not been possible and I

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,200
want to say that visit their Delta for

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,149
time and we have to do with so many

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,460
challenges in the beginning after half a

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,870
year half a year ago when we started to

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,260
prepare for the event because so many

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,809
people showed the injured that iconic

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,670
home and we have up to almost to the 200

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,460
speakers confirm we have very very good

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,649
contain this year and the number go down

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,140
and in doubt until you I think that you

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,439
or two weeks ago we still have 150 and

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,930
it just changing so quickly and still

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,450
today ain't just a lot later even we

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,920
realize that none of the sweet car

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,820
participant he being travel outside

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,759
Singapore can can come to to the venue

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:23,880
bird on the other side we have been

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,310
learning so much from this event so we

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,020
learned how to make the streaming so

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,130
previous to you we always have somebody

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,590
who come and supported with the

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,689
streaming but this time and the team

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,030
managed to take make everything possible

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,900
also there are a lot of question how to

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,570
handle queue in a and how to manage with

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,939
different partners and in supplier

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:51,810
place those are the few that we have so

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:54,840
much to learn after this this event yes

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,270
and so what we got what can happen like

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,549
so I don't know when the situation will

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,030
be resolved but since we see the last

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,670
few days

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,649
people's people everyone around the

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,810
world you need to be able to to say

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,730
connect and and to work together on

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,660
solution so we train stopping some idea

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,630
we already have a lot

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,630
feedback from from you who are in the

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,120
room but also from the people online we

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,730
were hoping to organize some kind of

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,340
online platform where people can come

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,810
and share digital solution around coffee

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,480
19 you know that there are people

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,400
working from Italy from Germany had a

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,880
situation in Vietnam people develop

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,830
solution locally and is not that and so

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,240
on the news of you we basically see

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,150
information about all the number of

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,950
cases increase this endoscope got Locker

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,900
is more important that we should

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,240
highlight the development have been

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,640
going on around the world and we hope

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,310
that in a few weeks we gonna put up an

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,350
online platform corner because we learn

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,150
so much or an online event but we focus

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,240
on this topic for people from

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:07,620
information to share their development

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,940
around it so the idea would be like I

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,950
don't know if we can pull it off in

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,320
three to four weeks I mean like we're

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,550
always making things very stressful for

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,150
ourselves right but like we can't really

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,040
wait yeah I mean like the the numbers of

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,810
people affected they go up and it's not

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,590
just people affected by the virus it's

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,370
like economically it's in many ways and

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,950
I just saw a projection that if we

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,459
actually slow down the virus it also

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,160
means that this crisis will go on much

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,610
longer so projects and projections right

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:49,800
now are at least out to March next year

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,390
and so huh that it's a long time and we

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,400
really need to work together and find

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,920
ways so we had a few chats with some

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,080
speakers today as well and the idea

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,200
would be to have like three different

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,170
kinds of ways how people can collaborate

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
of course we can have talks but people

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,970
can share their ideas and talks can be

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,870
followed like in the jitsi session like

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,750
what we had today

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,690
secondly we could have online workshops

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,940
and the these workshops can also take

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,430
longer and we cannot have too many

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,680
people in a live workshop on jitsi but

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,380
we can actually also stream that live

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,280
workshop and share it with other people

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,830
so that's the set

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,240
idea the third one would be to create

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,280
open collaboration channels in an event

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,280
where people could work together like

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,610
let's say in over a weekend or over

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,000
three days and this can go on 24 hours

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,750
because now the entire world is affected

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,940
so people are very open to this idea and

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,740
yeah we will share more about this we

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,580
will discuss this with the team but

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,650
that's our idea for now and and I think

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,390
that would be really a next step forward

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:08,540
right so we need everything to be

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:08,540
absolutely open I wish is to in the room

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:18,390
okay so so maybe like we can have the

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,850
short circle around what what is the

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:26,250
feedback of people so far what are our

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,440
next steps in the community okay

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,820
opinions please how did you find this

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,169
event right and so that he can hear and

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,169
then he can like pass it on to the

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:48,630
second microphone and but then he can't

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:53,669
hear what they say can you hear me

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:56,160
oh no I have to I have to I have I have

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:00,750
jitsi over here this one okay um can you

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,820
hear me oh okay never mind looks like

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,289
Johan cannot hear me but I think you

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,120
guys are I I think that the while the

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,240
social events were a little bit lean but

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,310
I would say that the talks were all

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,220
considering the amount of changes we had

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,120
to go through I think that that was very

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,880
well executed very well put together and

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,780
I think the a lot of willing hands came

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,120
along to help out when they were needed

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,880
any further feedback chance anyone else

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,390
I mean for me I really enjoyed it

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,599
it was good and the food was good thank

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,819
you

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:46,459
any issues that anyone found or run into

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:49,399
something missing you were not allowed

00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:56,749
to put on the clip Mike right because of

00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:58,369
safety and all that this guy yeah I mean

00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,809
that's the only pity but you know

00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:02,059
because when you're doing the recording

00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:04,609
of the talk you'll be very nice if there

00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:07,579
was a mic to be very nice and clear but

00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:11,469
that's a and I mean it's inevitable I

00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:11,469
mean you can't do yeah

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:37,980
on the first day in the lecture theatre

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:43,050

00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:46,770

wondering would it have would it would

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,670
connecting a LAN cables of that issue it

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:06,570

experience 19 if you if you wanna hear

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:19,800

about tackling covered 19 it's called

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,470
Project open air project open air org so

00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,790
there are several pieces the problem

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,620
that open source communities are already

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,309
working on there are mechanical

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,910
ventilators which just off alleviate

00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:38,339
that need to use your lungs to diaphragm

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,759
to breathe there are people working on

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:45,689
the oxygen therapy the cannulas the

00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:48,600
supply control the whole lot and yes but

00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:50,579
I think not for this session but yeah in

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,779
terms of Mario's question there's a

00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,199
bunch tougher has to happen and it's

00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:57,959
worth taking action sooner than later

00:10:54,199 --> 00:11:01,370
any feedback on good bad or room for

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,980
improvement in our much-reduced

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,319
summit I can't I can say except I think

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,129

gentleman here good good back good bad

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,439
indifferent roof improvement I think

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,290
there's no from even though it is my

00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:25,259
first time and when I came here I was

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,259
big shot like to find this tonneau is

00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:31,050
very low this is isten is this the usual

00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,089
turnout for all for you so so I guess

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,949
it's actually a Kobe 19's there's a

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,569
deter many people from coming to

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,449
Singapore so a travel ban restriction

00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:41,339
but after I think everything else is all

00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,959
very well done yeah I said I learned I

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,879
got to learn made new things yeah

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,129
because I'm is also a fennel sauce just

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,749
I never healed but this open source some

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,139
in or semanas yeah I usually go for the

00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,549
like a big commercial IT face yeah but

00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,949
it's my first time coming so yeah every

00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,720
grateful for being able to attend is

00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,410
totally I hope to come back near Phoenix

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,230
you

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,370
well India so a first-time attendee 844

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,160
sages how much who has had other

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,810
involvement in open-source appreciating

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,700
that it actually works and it's here and

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:14,480
surprised at the small numbers but

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:18,500
you'll know why that is thank you itself

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,900
nothing more to add really okay

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,950
interesting stop the back doesn't matter

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,160
back war phone yep

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,660
any feedback here things to improve look

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,370
good

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:42,320
anything anything we could improve yeah

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:46,010
hello we can't really appreciate your

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:50,430
race again time to put all this setup up

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:53,010
writing like looking forward to the like

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,440
as in looking to the future with all

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,390
these outbreaks happening I think maybe

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,570
we should prepare ourself all fully

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,460
online conferences yeah I did so the

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,900
feedback was we may need to prepare

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,520
ourselves for fully online operation and

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,630
that's sort of where we going and one of

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,430
the big questions that raised was how to

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,620
do workshops which is part of what the

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,720
discussion you ever heard here so yes we

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,790
are already swinging it because so

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,890
here's a point for those who are who

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,110
hadn't realized at least one eagle-eyed

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,930
person asked me why this year's t-shirt

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:25,200
doesn't have a date on it it is a year

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,020
but not the dates and part of the

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,580
thinking had been that if the Ministry

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,700
of this is six weeks ago when we were

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,110
young and naive if the Ministry of

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,540
Health declared or scorned read then we

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,950
wouldn't be able to go ahead and so at

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,200
that time the discussion of the other

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,940
line was that we would be willing to and

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,300
they'd be willing to go ahead with a

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,920
September event that may still be

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,590
possible but frankly I'm starting to

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,310
think it will not be because vaccination

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,600
really the until the endpoint is wide

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,460
spread of excitation programs have been

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,440
performed and that's really June next

00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,930
year maybe a little earlier if I'm lucky

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,960
so it's not only can we is September

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,720
unlikely much next year is looking

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,400
unlikely not yet certain we will watch

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,190
but it's conceivable that we can't even

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,130
do it then and so yeah we don't really

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,560
want to have a night

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,509
for the next 12 to 18 months and so I

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,360
think we have no choice but to work out

00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:21,370
ways to do at least some useful things

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,329
in a completely online form so the edits

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,069
will transform how we function but yeah

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,360
whether we get to do the second event

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,970
and use the same t-shirts with the same

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:36,970
year on them I'm not sure we were we

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:39,490
might not get to all right anything you

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,250
would like to improve yeah please don't

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:48,519
touch the microphone please don't touch

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:50,440
okay the perspective of a video

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,480
volunteer this is really an eye-opening

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,360
experience you know definitely come

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,380
again next year

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,579
perspective of video volunteers this is

00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,170
a really eye-opening experience and

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,329
publicly coming actually next year thank

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,889
you let us hope we have well yeah

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,730
perhaps late next year we will because

00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:09,940
thank its yeah for a while we won't be

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,730
able to help you then I mean so I'd say

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,790
that's and given the constrains and like

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,740
I've like been really impressed everyone

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,880
coming together and then like finding

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,189
their role and also contributing and

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,100
actually adapting to like to I think is

00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:29,290
changing and like often hour to hour

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,470
minutes a minute so that's that's really

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:36,279
impressive especially like you dose to

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:39,519
Ambrose for getting only the video

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:41,829
uploads in streaming Danny's pointing

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,079
out the impressed of the degree of

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:45,250
adaptation to changes sort of daily

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,290
hourly and sometimes minute to minute

00:15:45,250 --> 00:16:00,009
and a call that for Ambrose for the

00:15:47,290 --> 00:16:01,449
guillotine in particular yeah I I don't

00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,660
know I everything concrete to offer at

00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:07,630
this time no doubt I will think of

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,800
things afterwards anyone in the call

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:13,899
wish to I'll now switch modes

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,610
does anyone the call wish to provide say

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,559
back home focal hand control over to you

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:22,000
because I have to mute myself Oh Mischa

00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,029
so you've been too fast

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,670
Asia almost every year the past few year

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,640
and

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:33,680
and also in Vietnam Cambodia everywhere

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,750
how to give for you about like this how

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,510
can you continue to engage with us in

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,490
the future so I'm really missing the

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,760
event it was a highlight every year I

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,370
like it too Trevor I like to travel to

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,540
Singapore I like it too

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,450
I like to make projects that you would

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:58,970
like to do hacking I'd like to meet all

00:16:53,450 --> 00:17:02,570
the people who are curious and watch

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:08,230
watch a talk that I'm giving and so this

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:12,020
is this is like big festival and I'm

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,180
it's it's so bad that so many people are

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:19,220
putting so much work into this event and

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:24,740
now the participation is so limited by

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:27,740
because people I think people and like

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:32,840
the physical experience to to walk

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:37,550
around and to to be curious and and it's

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:43,520
it's something about to be a Discoverer

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:49,810
to discover things and so these are all

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,810
things that we are missing right now and

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:56,000
befallen that we this is the chance to

00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:01,460
to learn a lot of new things and new

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,900
ways to work I don't have a idea what it

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,870
could be what we can do in the next year

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:15,230
but it's a it's a really good

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:17,900
opportunity to find it out yet so Thank

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,120
You Misha and and you are right it's a

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,920
good opportunity for us to find out what

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,480
we can do so in India

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:28,070
organizers are right not only so the

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,160
team put in the more effort in

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,650
volunteers actually come very early I

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,000
think the different is and they also lie

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,070
in the fact that they can learn how to

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,990
set up the video and for us also we

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,720
learned a lot but I don't why

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:45,289
no we don't have that many participant

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,059
yes name it Alvin that really chain mind

00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:52,340
that make me become very positive the

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:55,130
way then and he he come life wouldn't

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,789
open myself to the event he had recorded

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,309
the session gonna be and also want to to

00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,570
say and learn what kind of like in

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,120
different section he did not know

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,700
everything many people he met or what

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,559
being said that is it really a big

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,480
motivation for me to continue to run the

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,120
event as Moroni mentioned a lot of

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,610
sponsor drop out and we don't also don't

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,190
receive support from from from the

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,320
people who promised to support the event

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,230
but we see managed to make even happen

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,720
and I think that even we only have one

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,000
participant or two participant which

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,890
they want to do to continue to create a

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,799
platform where people can actually share

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,320
and and and work together we did it

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:39,230
before ten years ago we was very small

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,850
we never get people's my supporters but

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,370
with you together with the community we

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,669
make it happen and and now I think in

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:50,630
the difficult time and even also people

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:52,880
can show up we do have people who come

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,100
in who take leave and very serious so

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,440
that really make the organizer feel that

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,970
our work or for payoff and the good

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,000
thing is that all videos are available

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:05,690
online and people can to share and

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,610
continue so and and I think that I'm

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,919
really glad that we to be able to yeah

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,220
we will continue we will petrify

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:18,679
solution won't gonna press here

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:24,080
so as soon as people are allowed to get

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:27,529
together again however it takes how long

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,830
it takes it will be becoming a big

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,289
festival everywhere and every kind of

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,690
opportunity to meet and two things

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:39,159
together will be will be taken so I

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,980
think you you must carry on the Asia

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,720
Asia conference and other events because

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,760
there will be a time after the Karuna

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,679
crisis and people will be so happy to

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,679
participate again I am very sure

00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:01,690
thank you yes so we are happy if we can

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:05,620
see you again in person so it will be a

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:11,250
big festival if this is over and I think

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,250
for a long time thank you

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:25,870
back to Rowland right well I don't think

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,490
we've got much else to cover I've said

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,100
thank you so you've sought feedback from

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,669

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,309
indomitable social organizer and asks

00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:50,470

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:55,030

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,679

the dependi this year and as organizers

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,580

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,450

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,309
