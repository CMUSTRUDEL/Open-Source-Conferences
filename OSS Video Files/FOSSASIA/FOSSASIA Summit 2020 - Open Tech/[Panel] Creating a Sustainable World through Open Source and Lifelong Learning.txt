	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,049
so the course the question for this is

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,779
how can open-source help to build as a

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,890
sustainable world Alex we've sort of

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,380
looked in the past about the economic

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,179
and environmental issues we are now

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,080
realizing it was perhaps a biological

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,340
issue that none of us have thought about

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,020
prior to about make weeks ago how can

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,330
SMEs and organizations for generally

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,570
leverage the skills future initiatives

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,609
here and how cannabis was build

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,810
sustainable solutions I think it's it's

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,940
an evidence-based

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,170
discipline and to discovery of

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,300
fundamental phenomena and principles and

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,460
how things work and and building on that

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,079
discovery that kind of knowledge we can

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,140
then translate into technology that can

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,030
help solve problems so many of the

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,800
things that we enjoy now we have to say

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,570
because of science so science is

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,170
inherently important to us

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,050
science is eneral inherently driving

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,809
force in our civilization

00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,809
and-and-and the part about how science

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,059
can come in any from a science center

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,040
perspective we've been shot in this

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,610
slogan especially about among young

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,220
people that made made a power of stem be

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,460
with you we want to empower our young

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,049
people to understand the importance of

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,600
stem science technology engineering

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,020
maths and in recent time we are so

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,500
putting on this notion of stem plus stem

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,670
must plus something else values ethics

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,080
accountability integrity all these are

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,270
important things that we should bring in

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,159
and stem is not moving closer and closer

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,000
to integrate with social sciences

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,829
philosophy and thinking and we all start

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,460
from young and thanks data is really

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:47,399
putting in long effort to want to raise

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,740
the awareness appreciation to empower

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,920
our young people to know how to use stem

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,710
for sustainable development for the

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,869
goodness of the world and that's reason

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,270
why senator when we were introduced to

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,219
force Asia we were we have been a strong

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,810
supporter behind all this and early on

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,810
we saw more real very emotional I'm

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,280
talking about how open source is a way

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,870
to help to make so called saw the

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,280
inaccessible science energy discovery

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,920
and I

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,540
P especially I know a key from a

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,660
university usually no you must protect

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,950
it you know must you must make the IP

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,810
money making machine

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,760
but now the wall is telling us that

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,100
that's not the only way of moving

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:39,190
forward and sometimes signs and

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:39,190
Technology share in open helped so yes I

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,399
[Music]

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,709
[Music]

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,170
proceed but for forcing to us that's how

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:21,500
science has science has preceded

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,459
software is pure commercial tool and

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,310
it's open source

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,019
you must check a code says drastically

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,400
change that it's almost the same idea it

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,590
says ok if you're making software it's

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,820
user for than you before but actually it

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,200
then means to be in the hands of others

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,500
rather than everybody starting from

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,190
scratch

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,709
so it's yeah the parallel is interesting

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:44,989
I'm always conscious of time otherwise

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:47,209
we see for hours so that's when you've

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,350
been previously you're not no longer

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,730
right the the sort of driver here oh I

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,410
yeah I don't even know how to pronounce

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,690
the name of the company we own as here

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,400
is that origin it is origin for the

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,910
Obinna for the audience the G has been a

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,470
place with a nine or a nineteen but okay

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:10,459
origin three funky name has been folded

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:12,829
it yes very good the business skills gap

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,750
to lifelong learning lifelong education

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,090
is seen as a central success factor for

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,370
society

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,550
and it's great as it is in Singapore

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,590
what impact could observe or have you

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:32,449
observed about programs and initiatives

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:35,000
what what stands out for my perspective

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:38,810
I used to be in skillsfuture and I've

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,979
been startled my career after my Emily

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,440
stint in a fast development agency so I

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:48,530
expect the past 14 years I've been

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,960
working on both force development as

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,440
well as lifelong learning so in this

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,360
perspective I think related the question

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,530
I think lifelong learning as we all

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,590
would agree is increasingly if not more

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,760
important than evolve in the fact that

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,810
continuing education is something that

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:12,380
we all should continue to aspire and to

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,990
to develop ourselves so from from the

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,870
aspect in terms of the program that the

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,460
past years have seen some progress or at

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:23,060
least from the government perspective I

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,860
think skill future initiative is one

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,110
which we could probably take the

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,450
opportunity to also interpret the fact

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,120
that government in Singapore has been

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,700
very proactively trying to put in place

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,740
a system a national effort in a national

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,530
movement to ensure or at least to

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,310
encourage every individual citizens and

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,260
permanent residents to really adopt this

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,330
lifelong learning mindset in fact

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,419
lifelong learning is not new in fact

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,169
it's been round since we can remember

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,570
the fact that even as a nation in fact

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,270
lifelong learning nation-building is

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,070
based on lifelong learning if I may just

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,660
say in the if you may just indulge me I

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,729
can kind of give you a bit of a brief

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,720
history about Singapore since

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:11,150
independence till today we actually have

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,580
been really adopting what lifelong

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,280
learning is about from learning to

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,560
survive in the early days when we got

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,800
our independence in the 60s all the way

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,570
to early seventies and then with we

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,409
actually go on the next phase of

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,990
learning to stay ahead as a as a nation

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,539
as a country as more country we have no

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,020
natural resources obviously the human

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,300
capital

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,550
human results are the only resource that

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,530
we have and if we don't capitalize on it

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,659
and to ensure that what first element is

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,180
in place and every individual is a

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:47,150
talent by their own rights and how they

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,690
can be developed and honest in terms of

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,669
their very best then as a country we

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,310
will be doomed so to speak and

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,259
henceforth from there on we find that we

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,210
move on to learning to stay ahead to

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,860
learning to compete because as we learn

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,590
about the truth of things and we know

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,560
about how we can survive and how to stay

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,380
next is naturally learn to compete among

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,750
the neighboring countries and even at

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,940
the global stem hands off you can see

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,490
that the next phase in the 80s to the

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,520
90s we also go into the phase we call

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,680
learning for life and today at the

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,110
latest faced with his skill future it is

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,840
learning for a new world obviously to

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,229
this various phases of learning as a

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,599
nation we actually count progress from a

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,909
low-skilled low-wage country to now to

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,050
date as one of the developed country

00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:41,270
where we are dotting innovation based

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,580
economy and obviously trying to also

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,430
States to survive in the industrial

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,900
revolution 4.0 so to cut

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,699
yeah to kinda dress the question is that

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,419
there how this program actually helped

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,979
actually from from the perspective of a

00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:00,020
nation you find that it works only

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,490
because there is close collaboration

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,400
between the government and the private

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,440
sector and if this collaboration is not

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,020
strong you'll find that there is always

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,539
this issue about you know policy is not

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,729
being disseminated right now very

00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:15,949
clearly to the main industry and

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:18,310
obviously at the company level you can

00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,680
see that if the bosses or if the

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,050
employers are not vocalist of lifelong

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,849
learning then the stuff in a way will

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,159
not be able to really harness their

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:30,740
potential and to learn what they need to

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,510
learn to be obscure and rescale so that

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,640
they can cope with the uncertainty in

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,589
the economy and right down to even

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,930
community if you can see there are

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,180
successes in in sample in the sense that

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,760
the committee's are working together

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,070
with the community Community Development

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,910
Council every region every districts are

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,250
if

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,170
can see there are learning opportunities

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,510
where people work together with the

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,370
businesses education institutes as well

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,790
that individual resident in a particular

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,070
constituency so these are just some

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:07,040
success stories I could see how as an

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:09,980
issue we can push a sort of brought a

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,590
context question and this is I actually

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,650
don't know this because of a decade but

00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,290
there certainly was a cultural norm

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,430
growing up in Australia that education

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,750
was a thing you did in your sort of

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,150
childhood your teens and your early

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,520
adulthood and then once you had whatever

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,920
level of sort of bachelor's or master's

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,570
perhaps docked with you pursued unless

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,830
you were staying in academia you kind of

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,040
sort of stopped at that point and then

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,850
we can get something real with the

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,950
continuing professional education

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,570
obligations that that members of

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,400
professional societies have that's fine

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:45,650
but the but even those are fully fairly

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,090
modest is there a change in Singapore in

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,470
the mentality has that mentality exist

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,330
in the past and is it now I need to

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,160
teach people not just at Singapore as a

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,890
society as the Loom but that individual

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,810
Singaporeans have to switch from my

00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:00,230
education my childhood teens and early

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,880
adulthood to to it's a soul engagement

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,910
throughout my life to learn new skills

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,130
and new approaches yes of course that's

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,080
the change in fact they were also saying

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:14,090
that because of this especially now 4.0

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,490
we're you know disruptive technology

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,800
things are just I mean new things that

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,210
kept popping up and so on right so if if

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,930
you get a degree I think you can set it

00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:30,140
out in the career and then for life good

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:35,510
luck okay Irish try a suite of things I

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:39,460
could ask you and I areas of concern is

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:41,810
this Malaysia how can open source help

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,230
make the world more ecologically

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,770
sustainable what are the things that

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:52,490
purposes communities and organizations

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:55,100
can do if you don't do open we have a

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,470
huge problem and we have seen it already

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,000
defaulting to open across the board I

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,230
mean doesn't matter what it is whether

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,279
it is

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,809
science research work publications

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,540
people learning about stuff teaching one

00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:10,579
another the content is open the more

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,730
people get it the better it becomes I

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:16,759
mean we have seen it empirically it's

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,639
not a wishful thinking in that sense so

00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,739
we know that works and this event itself

00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,259
in many ways everything that we are

00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:26,119
doing here a lot of it is built on open

00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,519
technologies of one form or shape or

00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:30,139
manner so having said that I think the

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,239
the question that you're trying to

00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:41,089
probably ask is about how do we sustain

00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:42,739
it is by educating by getting people to

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,799
understand what is available what is out

00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:47,239
there talk about different ideas and and

00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:50,209
challenge that I think

00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:53,199
jibing has in the university is the

00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:57,110
notion that I have to protect my ideas

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:59,629
otherwise how do i monetize it aspect

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,249
which is going down a path which is

00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:06,619
actually sadly that's not really the

00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:08,119
fully thought through process what what

00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:11,990
do I mean by not fully thought through

00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:14,480
is because none of those researchers had

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,309
people in the university are the ones

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,990
who potentially may be turning it into a

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,879
commercial operation they are not the

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,749
ones they will depend on somebody else

00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,910
to do the job for them

00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:25,069
in the mean time between them creating

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,319
whatever that was created and they hide

00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:29,629
it they keep it to themselves and it

00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:32,600
goes out in industry the lag period is

00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:35,569
indeterminate we have no idea if it ever

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,029
goes out there so if I use that as the

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,959
starting point so when I talk to

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,059
organizations and a lot of startups that

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,439
I help consult with as well from an open

00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:47,029
perspective right they say oh we have

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:50,029
stuff that our VCS have asked us to

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,529
patent to protect from an IP perspective

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,759
blah blah blah we don't share ideas we

00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,069
want to keep before ourselves and so on

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,019
so in yen I my question to them would be

00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:00,379
so you are so this is a start-up

00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:03,139
scenario a startup you create stuff and

00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:06,679
you want to patent it you're gonna spend

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,240
a lot of money the people who end up

00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,329
getting the money would probably be the

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,049
lawyers and assume million in

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,049
transparency

00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:19,339
the other one's gonna get that money

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,569
while while you may have gotten a piece

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,550
of paper saying that this has got a

00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:24,529
patent then it's got X number of years

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,800
or whatever what are you gonna do with

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:28,100
it

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,389
oh we're gonna keep it oh are you in my

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:35,980
question then are you going to actively

00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:35,980
license it to somebody else oh yeah yeah

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,610
so the the the the startups that I

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,680
helped explain to the NSA why don't you

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,480
just go ahead and open it up and the

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,660
point about it is not about holding it

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,809
back is by if your ideas are in you and

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,920
you don't execute on it it's useless you

00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:02,959
may have the best idea in the world

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,730
execute they say oh I cannot present

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,959
this edit even I cannot present it in

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,399
the universe I cannot write it in the

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,980
paper because somebody's gonna steal my

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,420
idea if the person stole your idea and

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:17,809
execute it on it kudos to him or her by

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,459
you not sharing it you have you have you

00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,899
couldn't execute so you failed it so

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,910
that's really whatever source of it the

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,829
broader problem that getting a thing out

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,629
into the world costs resources which

00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,029
generally means you're either gonna have

00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,939
enormous grants from somewhere or you've

00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,589
gotta build a business and in practice

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:36,319
the execution on those two things is

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,939
usually the more uncertain that's right

00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:42,019
tasks and so the idea of I've got an

00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:45,769
idea it's valuable so yeah I seen that

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:48,529
it's a toss up because if you are not if

00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:51,199
you don't get it it seems to be an aha

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:55,429
moment that happens with people about

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,899
sharing it is when you share it for

00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:59,800
whatever it is that you share and then

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:02,990
you benefit from it somehow not directly

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,379
that sometimes where you say oh that was

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:10,819
good that I did that it takes some time

00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:14,329
for that because SS as a as a as species

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:18,230
we share a lot of things we grew up

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:23,240
sharing things that's how we've always

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:25,700
been somewhere in the system does the

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,880
sharing stopped

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,190
and that became a problem but why was it

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,130
stopped and why what was the motivation

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,710
for the stop was kind of forgotten in

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,120
the midst of and more is better

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,860
yeah I'm reasonably certain but patent

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,810
trolls a response for a lot of this not

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,900
directly but because their existence

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,080
creates an after market for patents of

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,210
struggling visitors who very very keen

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,180
to have the patents because that gives

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,570
them a thing that remains if the

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,160
business fails and you only have to

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,290
think very short period arise what the

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,230
value that is the only value that has so

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,630
the best objective is if I pay a million

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,700
bucks into building this business and it

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,800
collapses them I walk I have nothing but

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,910
if patents were secured then I've got a

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,290
thing that's available why is it

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,420
valuable because I can sell it to

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,840
someone for money what can you sell to

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,110
for money

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:22,880
a troll the only people who buy generic

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:24,590
patents same but the so the it's not

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,000
just this is a bit of the argument about

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,370
copyrights of music it's not in fact

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,470
about benefiting the creators sorry I'm

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,930
becoming a panel a member of the post

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,130
but it's actually often this secondary

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,510
market that no one thinks about that is

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,520
changing the behavior of investors not

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,680
for their own benefit because they want

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,470
something to monetize if the business

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:51,980
fails and that distorts all the behavior

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:53,900
of the story sustainability that is some

00:16:51,980 --> 00:17:01,630
area aspect of sustainability that

00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:04,220
doesn't feedback positively negative

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,380
thing into the system yeah invite

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,820
audience members like these three rather

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,440
than to get over here do any of you have

00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:17,150
questions you'd like to pose in this

00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,370
sort of broad area about how we use

00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,190
openness free numbers or suffering

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,920
particular but openness generally and

00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,560
the the axis of it access to it in an

00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:33,740
educational setting to address questions

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:37,800
on sustainability this is no okay maybe

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,870
if I were to post a question sorry

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,400
apparently I have an urgent message well

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,970
question I see yes because we have

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,200
people remote God it's like we have for

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,860
with technology that's an open source

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:56,370
and we have forgotten to use it do we

00:17:49,860 --> 00:18:08,640
get which phone has it too much

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:12,530
technology sometimes right question

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,200
could could the Singapore government

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:18,870
open-source the government code

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,940
especially when it was done using public

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,920
funds wow this is not a crazy question

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,580
this comes up a lot

00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:30,180
I think much this seems very close to

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,280
your heart I can't speak for the

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,930
government and I don't know whether you

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,740
can speak for government but as a

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,930
citizen as a taxpaying citizen I want

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,050
the code that government writes that is

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:47,540
built using taxpayer money to be open

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:52,340
sourced very simple sorry

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:55,590
all of it subject to national security

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,930
requirements so I don't want necessarily

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,580
to say Oh everything Ministry of Defense

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,190
does or defense science technology

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,500
agency does or any of the defense or

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,450
security related stuff necessarily to be

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,350
opened up but anything that is done from

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:14,340
a public perspective for example parking

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:18,810
dot SG it's a it's an app that allows

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:21,440
you to pay your parking fees wherever

00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,700
you park in Singapore great open it up

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
let me add some stuff too I don't know

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,060
what I want to add but maybe I can maybe

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,550
I can't but maybe I can check I don't

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,890
know what it is but do it it's easy to

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,380
do after all was built using open source

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:39,120
tools at least one of LTS was the the

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,280
on-demand bus I don't recall I know

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,620
there was some something but again it's

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,710
got to do with I as a taxpayer as a

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,920
citizen I think we should because it is

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,750
our money that have went into it however

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,630
you know I I can only speak as

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,419
an individual and naturally I'm biased

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,309
because of what I believe in and I think

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:03,750
this makes a lot most power ever I pass

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:06,840
it off to I'm not speaking on behalf of

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:10,080
government but I came from University

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,270
and I understand that discussion the

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,159
production of IP and the value of patent

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,650
and so on and regards to this

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,990
perspective of whether whatever is

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,890
funded by the government should be given

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,350
up for open use and so on I think

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,760
there's a fine line to draw right

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,320
because somebody could have paid for

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,929
this development and some development

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,580
cost a lot of money so I guess there

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,010
there should be some kind of value to

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,350
say how much is in there and who is

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,830
paying for it and how can you you know

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,570
weigh balance at a sign Center we always

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,510
talk about how do you balance doing good

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:49,049
and doing well doing good means you do

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,970
for goodness of the larger community but

00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,950
I must do well because you must be able

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:55,740
to bring in money to sustain your doing

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,929
good if you continue to do good I don't

00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,860
do well rackety you rather abandon your

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,960
own resources

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,830
you can't even develop new technology so

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,169
how do you balance that so this about

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,400
perceived additional costs involved in

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:10,530
making sauce could happen who is this

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,980
about giving up the opportunity to

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:17,610
commercially exploit something because

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:21,090
to sustain the creativity the innovation

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:23,730
you need investment and somebody's gotta

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,929
pay for it and if the product turned out

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,330
to be something that can benefit

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,299
everybody but there's no return one way

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,100
or another so the next question would be

00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,630
then how do you measure the return is

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,179
the return in terms of dollars and cents

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,340
or also written in terms of the Wellness

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,570
and a sustainability of the ecosystem so

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,000
that you don't have to go and do damage

00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:46,110
control so if let's say that return is

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,919
everybody's very happy you can't buy

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:52,830
happiness right strong social capital

00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:55,409
into him how do you put a value to the

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,450
innovation that justified that huge sum

00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,400
of money coming in so that's one aspect

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,740
another aspect is would somebody then

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,470
use your your technology and they are

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,410
clever now to twist it around to make it

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,870
something that you

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,930
pay for them to sell you thank I think

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,180
that yes that's exactly where we turned

00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,860
the opportunity into how you make it

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,860
available the licensing model the

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,290
open-source licensing model so you know

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,270
what we can do like for example I mean I

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,680
just cite a very simple example happen a

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,220
few years ago where the Prime Minister

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,920
he wrote a bit of code I believe it was

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:36,820
in the I 10 if I'm wrong or wrong on how

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:38,710
to play good Sudoku for his wife and he

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,950
published a code so when he published

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,070
the code I saw it and I said firstly

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,510
there are few issues with the code okay

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,120
because he didn't put a license

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,710
statement on it I say please put a

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,320
license and how am I supposed to share

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,110
this how am I supposed to use it how am

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,000
I supposed to fix it if I want to fix it

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,930
eventually he did publish and I put it

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,580
on - he didn't put it on to any specific

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,280
repository so I put it on my repository

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,040
I make it a public site and put his

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,900
email response to me as part of the repo

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,850
as well to say okay this is a Prime

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,180
Minister's code this is the code and

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:19,050
then he said this is on MIT license fine

00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,820
so the point about is we need people at

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,470
government level at the highest possible

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,120
level understand some of these things

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,360
because at the end of the day is about

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,790
licensing when you create something as

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,830
you just mentioned that what if someone

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,330
takes whatever we have we have all Creek

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,700
collectively created and then it turns

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,860
it into a bow

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,380
it cost me a lot of money to even use it

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,090
and then it close it up well the

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,620
starting point is what is the license

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,600
that you create that you put your

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,570
whatever your creations on in the first

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:55,300
place I personally you know I'm biased

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:59,320
towards a a GPL type of license because

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,660
you cannot close it up end of story any

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,420
other license it's not necessarily in my

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,700
favor in the long term it is in favor

00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,880
whoever expands on it and then you know

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,790
closes are parts of parts of it which is

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,010
yeah it's still open part it's not so

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,050
that is an argument and discussion that

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,610
we have to have at government level so

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,330
that was the courts without by

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,499
government

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,999
but it's also a project-by-project

00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:25,960
different projects have different

00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:28,570
economics and different different but

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,039
the thing is anything that I mean going

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,309
back to what you just said there's a

00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:36,570
cost involved in creating it agree but

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:39,759
the cost was from where from tax dollars

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:42,249
so it's your tax money my tax money and

00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:46,210
people around this room tax dollars to

00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:49,690
pay for that not something else for it

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:53,830
so now for example all of NASA's imagery

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:56,379
and mission data we collected during the

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,690
Apollo program is in the public domain

00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:05,470
but more than that everything that NASA

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:07,989
does for that matter is special values

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,899
of the word everything but the

00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:12,700
overwhelming majority is for the greater

00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:14,289
good and from their point of view it's

00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,570
it's more than the United States is

00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:19,119
benefits all of us in many ways

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,359
I mean GPS is another example of a yeah

00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,429
you know we can use the data for free no

00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,820
issues there but the point I'm trying to

00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:30,399
make is that opening it up because of

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,999
the source of funding to create it in

00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:35,619
the first instance it's my argument by

00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:38,080
opening it up how are you making it

00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,759
available we don't we shouldn't be in

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,710
the business of we as in this case

00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,029
government for example should not be in

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,730
the business of trying to create in

00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:47,320
license for whatever use what is already

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,330
done he's already been thought through

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,879
there's enough experience with people

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,129
the legal community has been switched on

00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:56,139
to us to an extent that is they can

00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:58,659
understand some of the nuances they're

00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:01,149
also just significant internal costs so

00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,279
a lot of things like one map which

00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:05,889
continues to persist in using the the

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,659
Nokia engine at LeMans cost

00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,710
yeah and the reasoning is all that we we

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:09,940
get to keep everything secret because

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,460
that way we can make money in that wait

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,739
what it's that way you can give them to

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,359
Nokia I don't this doesn't seem like it

00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:19,119
makes any sense but talking to a group

00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,379
who implements stuff for one map for

00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,559
multiple government bodies on a contract

00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:25,989
basis they are pushing for up entry map

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,130
and the response is always this whole

00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:29,300
honor we have to protect it

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,660
you're just protecting your ability to

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,640
give money to nokia nokia you're just

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,240
bringing to your ability to have to then

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,150
go and buy a really costly commercial

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,770
tool so it's the it's not even it's not

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,000
even that you should argue about where

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,700
to draw the line this is an example

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,690
where so far as I can tell the things

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,320
are turned on it's here a lot of times

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:54,530
I've noticed that the aha moment happens

00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,800
like in that scenario could happen when

00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:02,150
Nokia disappears yeah okay at which

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,740
point Oh what do I do I'm stuck I can't

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,480
fix this I can update this I can do

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,430
whatever it is I need to do that's the

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,220
other way to return that's hedge against

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,740
oh I'm stuck that's nothing new

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,270
happening it's the mother of all hedges

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,850
against supply chain risk it's like you

00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:21,650
don't have any is this an area that you

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:23,810
would like to weigh in on perspective is

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,730
that I may be wrong because the

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,280
open-source community I mean the

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,660
awareness of the use of open-source

00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,360
perhaps in Singapore is not as strong as

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,360
in elsewhere henceforth I thought one

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,790
idea is that if practitioners or open

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,900
source subject matter experts can

00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:45,350
actively profile the contribution or

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,720
maybe tap on existing government funding

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,430
in terms of like innovative fund where

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,890
Institute for loved learning always

00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:54,530
every quarter or half a year have this

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,570
is it a Shinto get people to come and

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,460
provide solutions learning solution for

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,430
example and they can actually come

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,770
together and create open source solution

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,080
perhaps and that can offer to the

00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,910
companies out there and then they give

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,280
something like two hundred thousand as a

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:12,530
development fund so I suppose there's

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,970
also the awareness of what can you tap

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,340
on and some of the schemes the

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,770
government already put in place likewise

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,950
even encouraging SME to go

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,360
internalization internationalization

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,700
obviously they are also SME and startup

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,910
or trying to leverage on some funds to

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,130
produce produce solution for for any

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:34,880
particular industry needs that could

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:36,890
also be a Avenue for people to explore

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,870
using open source solution rather than

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,460
you know tradition

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:43,780
that a suspect it's probably going to be

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,780
a more bottom-up thing as it was in

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,430
Lifelong Learning Institute we have a

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:51,970
fun because encourage learn as Jesus

00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,860
it's fun oh god that cannot monetize

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,410
monetize your product but it sends is to

00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,120
encourage others to to know about what's

00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,790
open source what the magic that you can

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,100
generate and ideas like what Mario has

00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,840
mentioned you can start to proliferate

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,070
this to that more and more people can

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,050
come together with a common

00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,880
consciousness the government may take

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,980
northeaster actually there are a lot of

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,210
potential in open-source and they can

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,550
actually help these people who are

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,530
passionate about this area to really do

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,410
something at this point in time I

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:28,809
suspect I may be wrong that they do not

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:31,730
see that active how we can help SME

00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,620
funds traded and so on in our government

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,570
cannot really have everything but if

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,670
there are people who actively create

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,580
open source solution and SME can use it

00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:43,480
almost for free for low-cost I'm sure

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:47,480
there will be traction there as well

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:52,750
places to improve we've got eight

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,750
minutes left questions anyone none

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:35,539
so a question only please I'm not I got

00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:39,830
three panelists is so is it appropriate

00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:42,019
is it feasible to put open source tools

00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:44,929
and systems in the hands of students

00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:47,059
when they're learning about tick so I

00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:52,909
think this is I think is it's not with

00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:54,919
tipping can be and I think it is open to

00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:57,769
students who who can appreciate

00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,479
understand how to use them so that

00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:01,940
that's back to where we say we need to

00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:04,489
start young to empower them and let them

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:07,399
understand and open to this open source

00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:09,499
or call also and build on what does one

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:12,320
say sometimes that is a communication

00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:13,399
understanding if we could let more

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,549
people to understand what open source

00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,349
all about and in a way also sure that

00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:20,179
young people can also understand it's

00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,519
not about how old and how smart you are

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,229
is a matter of understanding how to use

00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,119
it you empower them to go in there and

00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:28,159
open up your mind open their will open

00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,389
up the applications and I'm back to the

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,609
point a little bit because we need to

00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,719
talk about the business model that where

00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,629
you protect or not

00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:36,649
I also know build on what happen say

00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:40,190
probably the open source community

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:43,399
should also educate the larger community

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,989
because there's this fear that yeah you

00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:47,419
want me to open to you but you're

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:49,159
keeping something in secret right I let

00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,169
you know I even contribute in open

00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,219
source but you are the one monetizing it

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,609
without me knowing that mistrust so

00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:57,019
called

00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:59,059
I think the starting point for that I'd

00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:03,649
suggest the whole procession by itself

00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:05,460
is one of the major areas where open

00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:09,720
source has been successful

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:12,450
is all of the plumbing for any given

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,200
pickle - out of fact there's a bunch of

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:18,570
stuff that has to work technically but

00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,530
in a commercial setting does not affect

00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:24,480
the decision of customers to buy and

00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:25,800
often this is the overwhelming in

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,020
software the overwhelming majority of

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,210
the software is in this category and in

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,430
that environment the not invented here

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,010
syndrome is is really harmful and so

00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,630
it's but if nothing else cooperate in

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,130
that space this is what I bought him out

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,840
I think you'll find it's already

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,330
happening it was 20 years ago I was

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,100
happening Copa America that you guys

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,560
were saying no customer has ever asked

00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,350
me about Linux and then it became

00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,690
apparent that every single fortune 500

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,580
company was the same year was using

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,070
Linux in some mission critical role at

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,950
which point the world just went oh wait

00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,570
and the the mind shift occurred and

00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,650
occurred very quickly but it was that

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,450
was actually moral grounds up thing

00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,790
about app thing that engineer is getting

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:08,010
a job done we're just picking up open

00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,390
source components to get it done and of

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,250
course feeding back fixes because it

00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,160
just makes their life easier so that is

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,720
a sort of strategy for getting it in it

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,910
happens by itself it is working but the

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:23,640
this high level how to address the hey

00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:29,910
you treating me am I missing something

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:32,580
how are you profiting that's extremely

00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,950
very constrained and concern as well III

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,960
let me I'm not gonna toot the horn for

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,910
red head but I work with red head but

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,410
I'm not pitching that in any sense but

00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,410
there are some learnings and lessons

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:46,260
that I'm more than happy to share

00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,120
everything that red hair does it's it's

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,760
all open source time we work upstream we

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,800
call it upstream we work upstream every

00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,330
single product that we ship there is an

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,430
open source project and an open source

00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,090
product a product is what we ship to our

00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,950
customers

00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,230
the product is based on an open source

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,120
project and it is a two-way street

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,770
things that happen in the project goes

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,510
into the product improvements in the

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,820
product goes back to the project so it's

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,400
a two-way street and the key message

00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,750
there is that we work upstream we want

00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,660
to make sure that a project is

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,280
successful and then we do what we need

00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,399
to do to make it work for the customer

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,039
but in doing that we

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,599
the part we are we are opening up

00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,609
everything to say hey look mister

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,319
project this is what we're doing with

00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,669
the project you had is how we fixing it

00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:31,339
this is how we are doing whatever we're

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:33,020
doing and we tell the customer this is

00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:35,929
coming from the open source project but

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,819
we are accountable to you this way you

00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,700
can come to us for any kind of liability

00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:42,559
we our neck is on the line for that and

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,529
that's why you pay us for that right and

00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:50,389
so this way it is a very transparent

00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:52,960
model and I feel I feel very happy to be

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:55,369
in that kind of a space because it

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,380
resonates with my own personal ethos as

00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,329
well I'm not screwing the customer in in

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,430
a in a bad way I'm not doing bad things

00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,569
to the to the community I'm trying to

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,490
make sure everybody success so it's

00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:06,559
win-win-win everywhere so that's really

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,119
what we need to do there will always be

00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,920
somebody's gonna say oh you're hiding

00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,779
something please tell me where I'm

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,750
hiding what am i hiding please show it

00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:16,730
to me then I'll try and unhide it we

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,680
haven't so that's really the message

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:38,960
there but again it's not an easy thing

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:44,569
to do we stumbled upon it by magic come

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:49,400
happen boom and bust happen so try to

00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:50,510
figure out so this one panels go fast

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,200
too fast I hope this has been

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:59,900
interesting I have a thanks for my lists

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,900
