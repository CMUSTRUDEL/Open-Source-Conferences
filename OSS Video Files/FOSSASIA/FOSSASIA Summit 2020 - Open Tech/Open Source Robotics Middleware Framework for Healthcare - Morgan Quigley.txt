Description: 
	The healthcare domain has incredibly complex logistical needs around the clock to keep hospitals and various medical facilities running smoothly. As the growth of elderly populations outpace the growth of the workforce, the economies of scale are pushing healthcare providers towards automating as much of the logistics as possible. This includes delivering meals to patients, keeping supplies and medical instruments stocked, securely transporting pharmaceuticals, assisting patients who have difficulties with mobility, and more.Modern and emerging robot platforms can help address each of these needs on an individual basis, but all these technologies need to be seamlessly integrated a single facility, and no single robotics vendor can feasibly affordably offer a complete integrated solution at the scale that is required. As a vendor-neutral open source robotics software company, Open Robotics is working with several Singaporean government agencies and robot vendors to develop an open source framework and open specification to allow heterogeneous robot platforms from any compliant vendor to cohabitate the same facility. This talk will discuss our current progress in this endeavor.
