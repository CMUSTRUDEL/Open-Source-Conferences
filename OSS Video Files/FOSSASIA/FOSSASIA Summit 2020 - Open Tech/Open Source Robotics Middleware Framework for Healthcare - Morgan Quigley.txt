Title: Open Source Robotics Middleware Framework for Healthcare - Morgan Quigley
Publication date: 2020-04-02
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Open Tech
Description: 
	The healthcare domain has incredibly complex logistical needs around the clock to keep hospitals and various medical facilities running smoothly. As the growth of elderly populations outpace the growth of the workforce, the economies of scale are pushing healthcare providers towards automating as much of the logistics as possible. This includes delivering meals to patients, keeping supplies and medical instruments stocked, securely transporting pharmaceuticals, assisting patients who have difficulties with mobility, and more.Modern and emerging robot platforms can help address each of these needs on an individual basis, but all these technologies need to be seamlessly integrated a single facility, and no single robotics vendor can feasibly affordably offer a complete integrated solution at the scale that is required. As a vendor-neutral open source robotics software company, Open Robotics is working with several Singaporean government agencies and robot vendors to develop an open source framework and open specification to allow heterogeneous robot platforms from any compliant vendor to cohabitate the same facility. This talk will discuss our current progress in this endeavor.

know how we do know great thanks for

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,059
having me

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,769
like my colleague Luca that just spoke

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,750
for previously I'm from the open source

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,849
robotics foundation slash open robotics

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,039
we're having office here in Singapore as

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,960
Lucas said as well as all around the

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,520
world so I'm going to talk about an open

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,580
source robotics middleware framework for

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,410
healthcare I'll get into exactly what we

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,849
mean by that there's lots of

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,769
applications of robotics of in

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,060
healthcare you know the first thing that

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,189
you think of might be surgery robots

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,230
which is great but there's also many

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,120
other applications of just logistics and

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,890
you know large hospitals are a giant

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,570
operation happening and just everything

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,040
needs to move everywhere else kind of an

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,110
all-time some I'll talk more about that

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,989
of course you can't talk very long in

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,910
robotics without saying we're hiring we

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,710
are hiring for many different roles you

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,079
know ranging from robotic software

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,000
engineers to DevOps to web to build

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,739
tests they're just a whole whole

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,329
software team that needs to happen and

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,930
we're always looking for great people

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,340
interested in this fun stuff so let me

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,080
back up a little and talk about the

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
motivation of why we're doing this big

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,439
project what exactly what you do and how

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,299
we're going to do it so these when we

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,710
talk about hospitals you know here in

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,570
Asia in general and Singapore in

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,259
specific these are very large buildings

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,270
in in large cities talking like 1,000 to

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,000
2,000 bed hospitals so there's a ton of

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,290
people involved in the situation there

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,330
might be thousands of people at any

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,119
given time inside the building all of

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,670
whom need to be you know fed taken care

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,259
of given supplies they need inputs and

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,570
outputs all profit appropriately so

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,490
there's a lot of opportunities for

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,680
automation to help make this these

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,659
processes run more economically so they

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,340
can scale to the anticipated needs of

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,259
the future the in general there are many

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,049
different vendors of robots that sell

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,850
into the healthcare robotic space so for

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,020
any particular size of supply that

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,479
you're trying to move around there might

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,880
be a few choices but it's very rare for

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,430
a vendor to be able to offer the full

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,689
you know full range of supply motion so

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,399
whether that's from just little small

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,469
medicine bottles all the way up to like

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,500
a giant cart or giant pallet full of

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,870
meals for an entire hospital ward

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,690
there's there's a wide range of volumes

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,070
and shapes inside

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,840
and masses that need to be moved around

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,250
a facility and again we're not even

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,780
talking about surgery robots here we're

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,910
talking clearly about logistics or

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,130
cleaning robots maybe you're just

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,390
anything that's not surgical so just

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,980
think you can kind of buck the block

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,860
that part of the domain out and think

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,430
more of this sort of facility management

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,900
facility processing helping so we're

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,280
going to build these systems we're

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,170
starting with open source robotics

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,300
projects that Luca mentioned called Ross

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,040
the robot operating system as well as

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,470
gazebo which is a simulation framework

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,420
and we're going to use those than to

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,190
build up to hospital scale simulation in

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,470
multi fleet management and I'll get into

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,970
through the next you know 25 minutes or

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,910
so what we mean and a little more

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,530
specific about that so at open robotics

00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,360
were the stewards of two large open

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,640
source projects the robot operating

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,010
system or Ross we've been working on

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,140
that in public now for about 13 years or

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,110
so the first I think official version

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,450
had a number on it maybe in 2007 or 2008

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,120
and you know ancestors go back quite a

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,800
bit further than that that the domains

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,960
are on the lower left Ross torger then

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,270
there's a new and improved everything

00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,720
better Ross - org also happening in

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,070
parallel on that project works hand in

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,100
hand with the simulation framework

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,900
called gazebo the the URLs are on the

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,040
lower right there gazebo Sims org and

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,860
then they're at the next generation

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,720
ignition robotics dork and all you know

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,820
kind of to summarize these big projects

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,739
in one slide here what we try to do is

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,620
to break up the robot software problem

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,510
into a bunch of small subproblems so

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,040
imagine like Luca was showing previously

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,989
and then open-source camera projects you

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
have the device driver node which maybe

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,870
can get the raw data from the imagers

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,600
and then publish it in a standard form

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,180
of a message that is a abstracted image

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,370
and then you can have further nodes that

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,260
listen to that message do some more

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,820
processing pass on more messages and

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,260
such so when you build or go about a

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,470
software system rather than building one

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,000
gigantic you know robot binary instead

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,290
you end up launching lots of lots of

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,420
little small binaries that find each

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,459
other at runtime so that's the dynamic

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,109
computation graph you seen those those

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,049
represented by those colored bubbles in

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,669
the middle there in simulation is

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,880
invaluable in robotics because these

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,420
systems cost a ton of money so that the

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,830
humanoid robot on the bottom

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,290
there you can see both in the renderings

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,840
and in the real world photo that's the

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,250
real NASA robot I don't even know how

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,210
much it costs there's an offer many of

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,830
them selves sometimes you don't even

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,410
really put a price tag on if it falls

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,730
over it's very bad so typically you know

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,870
it's all not good umbilical it hangs

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,620
from the ceiling so it can't really

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,390
follow my face

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,890
but yet you want to simulate it going up

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,840
and down stairs and doing all sorts of

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,460
interesting postures and nothing's you

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,780
are not willing to try on the robot

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,890
until you're really convinced that it's

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,720
gonna work out so that's where it

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,290
becomes extremely useful to have a

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,330
high-fidelity simulator I also in this

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,130
particular example that's a simulated

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,140
Mars landing site in a simulated Mars

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,720
Lander obviously those don't exists you

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,190
so when you're trying to simulate

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,050
difficult worlds or extremely expensive

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,310
worlds you can use these simulation

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,550
frameworks to save a ton of time and

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,350
money in the hospital this is all

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,060
relevant because hospital facilities of

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,440
course are critical in national

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,270
infrastructure everywhere they are and

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,950
so you can't just run arbitrary

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,270
experiments in them if you want to see

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,680
what happens with running different

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,920
numbers of robots for delivery or

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,390
different sequencing of lifts or

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,730
automatic doors how do you queue for a

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,690
door how do you queue for the lifts

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,910
those are experiments that you can't

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,320
really run in an operational hospital so

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,990
instead what we can do is we can create

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,060
models of these facilities and then run

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,980
all of our algorithms and test them in

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,330
this simulation so to do that we have

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,660
been constructing all sorts of

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,060
simulation assets so there are all sorts

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,440
of different roles of people in in

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,880
hospitals of course when you go there's

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,680
all sorts of different staff different

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,680
visitors different patients with

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,960
different mobility aids there to help

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,460
them as well as all sorts of hospital

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,170
equipment it's amazing when you start

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,000
walking around large hospitals how many

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,560
things there are that are basically in

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,170
the shape of a thing on wheels that you

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,220
push around it's kind of astonishing

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,790
everything from any kind of diagnostic

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,470
equipment to basically lots of different

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,020
shapes of computers on wheels that they

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,600
push around Co W called a cow there's

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,280
cows everywhere getting pushed around

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,050
sanitation carts that's just a few of

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,570
them that we've modeled in the picture

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,310
there but there's you know again

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,300
anything is sort of the shape of a cart

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,580
that you can push through a doorway

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,720
they've got it so we're some modeling

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,700
all these things that we can simulate

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,970
them and simulate the motions of the the

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,600
algorithms that are going to drive the

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,640
that's around the mechanical

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,350
infrastructure by which we mean doors

00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,660
and lifts are a key part of this

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,910
operation because large urban hospitals

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,410
are essentially stacked vertically so

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,030
it's very common for a large urban

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,920
Hospital to be ten levels you know

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,470
several levels below ground many levels

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,800
above ground where most of the

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,940
infrastructure to run the facility into

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,680
you know provide for the patient's needs

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,660
is in the oftentimes the basement levels

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,670
so things like the central kitchen the

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,310
central surgical supply sterilization

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,390
areas the laundry you can imagine how

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,040
much laundry is produced in a large

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,240
hospital right so running all those

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,610
lumens through giving them all staring

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,810
sanitized and ready to go back up that's

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,370
all in the in the basement of the

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,110
building and then all that stuff needs

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,520
to be distributed up vertically so we're

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,380
all the patient wards are usually above

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,580
ground for no airflow and light and all

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,630
that stuff so the the vertical

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,400
transportation provided by the the

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,930
elevators are really the kind of the

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,820
would dictate the throughput of this

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,740
entire operation so giving the

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,860
simulation of the elevator cabins or

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,210
lift cabins correct is a key part here

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,180
not only meant that Network and topology

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,770
of the lifts in many of these hospitals

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,720
that are quite sophisticated in their

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,050
use of robotics they have certain banks

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,550
of lifts or only for robots and then so

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,020
you can schedule those totally further

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,550
for the robot operations then there's

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,710
other banks of elevators that are used

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,450
for patients other banks used for

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,220
visitors and other banks for staff it's

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,620
very complex and it a typical hospital

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,160
will have 30 or more lifts just in the

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,350
in the complex as you can imagine once

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,970
the facility is built its approximately

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,430
infinitely expensive to add more lifts

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,090
so basically getting the most throughput

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,020
possible out of the current lifts is

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,830
required in order to keep introducing

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,600
more robust so here's a few of the

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,300
common healthcare grab us today that you

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,800
go if you go to public hospitals here in

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,789
Singapore you'll see some or all of

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,789
these the Panasonic cost be robots they

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,099
use Swiss log meal carts essentially

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,960
that the robot which I mean the kind of

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,750
second one from the left here it's a

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,099
cart full of food that sits on top of a

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,720
little robot that goes underneath that

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,980
cart and lifts it up a few centimeters

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,990
and I can drive it to where it needs to

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,760
go so odds are if you're if you're

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,930
ordered at a hospital here in Singapore

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,550
your lunch

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,620
your breakfast your dinner all comes on

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,690
these Swit all grobotz the essential

00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,430
kitchen is in the basement they drive

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,589
them around to the the service lifts and

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,960
they bring the cart up to the lovely

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,240
where you are they drop it near the the

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,459
nurses area in the ward and the nurses

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,470
will then hand it lever the the trays of

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,570
food out of that cart so you can imagine

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,970
if that cart is has the food for 40

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,310
people it's very heavy you know so it's

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,480
the robust guilt on down every breakfast

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,890
lunch and dinner they have to distribute

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,990
these cards to all the different wards

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,850
across you know let's say seven levels

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,110
of patients and then bring them back two

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:35,160
hours later to have all the dishes

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:36,300
washed and ready to go again so now I'm

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,620
gonna talk a little bit about what do we

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,990
do with this simulation model that we've

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,660
created and then the goal is to allow

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,390
multiple robot fleets so this simulation

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,890
snapshot it would be this is like what

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,750
would be great to happen in the future

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,310
just as kind of a cartoon of you have

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,870
three different robots from three

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,399
different vendors but they're sharing

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,250
the same space and they're operating

00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,200
recently around people so what we're

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,660
trying to do is to have it so that you

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,980
can mix and match these robots and it

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,970
you know the question of course is why

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,339
we're doing this it's just making

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,170
everything more complex and the kind of

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,510
easy single side answer is the robot

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,190
it's a rapidly developing field you know

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,170
every year if you go to robotics

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,480
tradeshow there's new applications

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,970
there's new providers of row Buster's

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,800
new robots of course themselves today we

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,140
do a lot of delivery in the field so you

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,089
see lots of like meal delivery linen

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,520
delivery medication delivery Case Files

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,810
in a hospital all sorts of stuff moving

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,610
up and down and around the facility

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,650
that's the delivery is very common today

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,450
but I think we can all agree there'll be

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,890
new applications in the future things

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,050
that we can maybe see coming on the

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,760
horizon are like more and more of

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,740
automated cleaning robots so imagine

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,779
like the Roomba vacuum but like you know

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,390
way more sophisticated with more of

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,130
maybe like the ultraviolet light so can

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,760
spray around to do the sanitation

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,600
sanitize rooms you know it can scrub the

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,459
floor with mop floors

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,810
what-have-you so cleaning is certainly

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,270
coming security robots you know

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,829
patrolling around when the facility is

00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,820
supposed to be closed or you know not

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,720
supposed to be someone there or if

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,120
there's supposed to be something or

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,470
whatever so all these applications are

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,670
coming and then of course there's many

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,130
that we probably can't even

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,720
now that will be out in a few years so

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,510
what we want to have our software

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,850
systems that allow new applications to

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,440
come into the field and just deploy them

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,750
without having to kind of sit there and

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,930
replan and reschedule all the all the

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,910
machinery so if you look at that picture

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,050
that's picture of Penang Malaysia we

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,880
took that picture if you months ago just

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,680
looking down from one of the big towers

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,710
there you can see there's an incredibly

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,010
complex field kind of a complex kind of

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,360
like flow of traffic there right there's

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,350
many different roadways they're all kind

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,930
of coming and going different directions

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,120
in an all flows fine and that's because

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,560
there's a well you know well understood

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,230
rules of the road that people follow

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,820
mostly and as long as most of the

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,860
vehicles follow most of the rules most

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,110
the time traffic can flow and when you

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,970
introduce the n plus one vehicle it just

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,010
merges into this flow and eventually it

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,840
goes where needs to go and so our goals

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,050
can we figure out something similar for

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,270
robotics so this is the situation today

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,540
and this is in in one of the hospitals

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,370
here in Singapore the the parts the

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,080
hospital that are really impressive

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,120
they're gonna essentially one robot

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,680
fleet and so this is a picture of like

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,550
on their upper right there their mail

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,900
carts so this is taking the it takes the

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,460
food out of the central kitchen and the

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,260
basement distributes it up to the wards

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,390
and then it like you know an hour later

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,400
it brings back the dirty dishes and

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,970
there's a giant facility that washes all

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,240
dishes

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,920
so it's impressive these are large

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,120
robots those are very heavy carts full

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,080
of you know food for 40 50 people and

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,460
you know it's it's actually kind of

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,600
amazing and almost hypnotizing they

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,620
stand there and watch these giant things

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,390
move around it's very well orchestrated

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,190
it's very impressive so the single

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,650
vendor fleets this is this is really

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,120
impressive to see this today what we are

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,390
trying to push those as multi vendor

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,550
operations in the same space so if you

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,930
look at how things are kind of where it

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,910
goes today it's like the fleets don't

00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,740
talk to each other so vendor a doesn't

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,840
talk to vendor B and so then you have to

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,670
either keep them separated in time like

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,410
you know you have the the meal robots

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,880
all go and then once meal robots are

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,380
back on their chargers then you can

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,730
bring up the other like kind of

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,970
miscellaneous delivery robots that's one

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,740
solution you can also just sort of hope

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,930
for the best and kind of just send them

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,820
through they all have course have

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,790
onboard collision avoidance sensors of

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,170
many different modality

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,790
and so they never collide it's just they

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,140
kind of do this kind of funny thing

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,340
sometimes we call a robot dance they

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,660
just sort of look at each other and like

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,280
one of them backs up and kind of like

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,870
it's sort of hilarious to watch and

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,570
eventually it'll all kind of the traffic

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,880
golf they'll see the lava usually so

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,290
it's it's not optimal I think we can say

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,480
that pretty safely and so wouldn't it be

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,220
great if if you can have a joint planner

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,420
that is planning for both fleets or at

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,830
least can kind of be like a traffic

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,090
police like you know you stop you go

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,060
that kind of thing

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,890
and finally the I mentioned a little bit

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,450
before but the lift integration is key

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,870
especially in these hospitals that have

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,130
so much vertical motion happening and

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,390
essentially it's a little bit hilarious

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,420
to think about but in some of these

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,830
facilities the reality is that there

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,320
aren't enough service lift to keep

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,820
dedicating new lifts and new vendors in

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
other words so if we have two vendors of

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,420
robots and you've allocated two banks of

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,860
service lifts to those two vendors you

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,880
actually can't bring on another robot

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,550
vendor because you don't have any more

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,020
lifts to dedicate to them because lifts

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,810
are essentially infinitely expensive to

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,760
add to an existing building so what

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,840
we're looking to do is to help multiplex

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,550
these lifts so that you can have

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,240
different vendors share the same lift

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:27,160
which is not current practice the goal

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,700
then is to more specifically same base

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,170
Multi Fleet conventions for for robot

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,480
operations so couldn't we come up with

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,430
something like a cross vendor Lane

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,100
network for example in these large

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,990
buildings so if your vendor n plus-1 you

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,310
sort of download the the road map just

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,930
like if you have a self-driving car

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,700
system and you're joining the public

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,050
road you download the public road map

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,920
and then you're not just going to drive

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,620
anywhere you're gonna follow the

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,330
existing traffic conventions so this is

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,370
a part of the project you'll be working

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,020
on is to to develop some conventions

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,580
like this that we can push out as a

00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,080
vendor neutral so so our organization

00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,430
doesn't make robots we don't have

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,220
anything robust to sell so we're not

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,080
trying to sort of you know push one over

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,180
the other what we're trying to do is

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,460
instead is to generalize these these

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,780
ideas of you know train traffic motion

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,320
how do you call a lyft how do you open

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,090
door that kind of thing so to do that

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,070
we've been creating open-source tools

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,650
the URLs there are on the upper left

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,030
this one is called traffic editor so the

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,950
idea is we can get their floor plans

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,720
from the facilities so there's that's

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,030
our an office kind of layout in the

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,640
lower right there and you can see we've

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,540
annotated the some robot lanes on there

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,790
and then the upper right is another is

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,500
another facility where we've we've taken

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,720
their blueprints we've traced the walls

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,070
the doors and stuff and then added where

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,660
we think the robot traffic lanes should

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,130
be and you can see there's different

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,630
colors in there it's implied that

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,910
different fleets might have different

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,080
routes through the same space because it

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,760
might be doing different tasks like

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,530
bedside delivery as opposed to a

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,830
surgical supply delivery or what have

00:15:53,530 --> 00:16:00,790
you an interesting thing this is this is

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,830
kind of an interesting journey we've

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,320
been going down is how much control do

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,640
we really get over these robots so these

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,220
are all you know safety certified

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,740
systems they're operating and in in the

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,480
hospital so it's not like you can just

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,920
go and casually run some new software on

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,650
these robots they're basically you know

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,390
completely welded shut but instead what

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,670
you can talk to is a fleet manager API

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,370
and most of the vendors provide some

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,410
distillates of an API where you can talk

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,050
to some over some protocol maybe it's

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,750
Rast maybe it's XML RPC what have you to

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:38,580
to issue various tasks or to get various

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:41,140
informations from them so as one example

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,970
maybe some fleets only will tell you

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,310
where the robots are but they won't ever

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,720
let you issue commands to the robots or

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,980
maybe other fleets will let you see

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,750
where their goals are and you can

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,730
temporarily pause a robot or it'll just

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,560
stop and then you can say resume your

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,760
task and it'll keep going again and

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,100
maybe some other fleets will give you

00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,660
full control where you can like give it

00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,920
a path to follow and it'll follow the

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,740
path as long as there's nothing in its

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,480
way and so they hope is that if we can

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,880
have a system which can deal with those

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,680
various levels of control then we be

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,110
able to mix and match and essentially do

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,860
what a traffic police officer does when

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,050
they stand in the middle of an

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,880
intersection and and just sort of you

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,060
know give hand signals to drivers to

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,650
help the traffic clear out so of course

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,199
the more control we have over these

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,720
fleets the more potential there is for

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,000
improvement so there's kind of a give

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,560
and take here if if the reality is just

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,910
that over one particular fleet of robots

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,410
we don't get any control we can just

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,050
read where they are then okay that's

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,370
just reality but we would then suggest

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,750
that they have other fleets in the

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,970
system that we can have more and more

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,190
control over

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,530
so to do this we're creating this a

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,830
vendor-neutral system the the URL is up

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,150
there in github RMF for robotics

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,240
middleware framework this is the core

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,130
scheduling system so you can imagine

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,929
that user interfaces this case would be

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,360
like the the surgical supply staff

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:00,940
making orders or requests for the new

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,799
supplies for that day's operations or

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,169
the the nursing staff wanting an item

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,990
delivered to the award so that goes

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:10,179
through a dispatcher or a task planner

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,679
which then talks to a negotiation

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,830
process between the different fleet

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,450
adapters and a unified schedule that can

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,179
able to predict where the robots are

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,280
going you know how much time they're

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,990
gonna delay waiting for this lift or all

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,080
that kind of thing try to push that all

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,340
into a grand unified schedule of the

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,409
facility of that some of the shared

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,620
space can all be allocated in a

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,610
reasonable fashion and one thing that's

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,890
kind of interesting about all these

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,870
robots is they all of them will yield to

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,280
the people in the hospital so if you're

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,140
if you get in the way of a meal card

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,669
robot it just stops it's kind of funny

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,380
then it'll like very politely say like

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,210
you know please move aside I'm trying to

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,409
make a delivery so it'll then you move

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,210
away and it just kind of keeps on its

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:53,530
way it so essentially the tasks that

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,350
your prediction of the task completion

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,299
time it can it can always be delayed

00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,590
because maybe someone like left a box in

00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,909
the corridor or something and the robot

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,159
is not willing to go around the box

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:04,960
it'll just stop there it'll then ask the

00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,340
box to move aside over and over and over

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,809
it's really almost comical it'll just

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,400
like Park in front of a box asking the

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,440
box to move aside

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,909
eventually it sends a page to one of the

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,380
operations staff and then they'll come

00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,270
and move the box out of the way and the

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,380
robot can keep going so essentially any

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,470
of these tasks can be delayed

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,700
arbitrarily but they'll never go faster

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,460
than you think they will so it's a bit

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,690
of an interesting planning problem

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,400
robots all have a speed limit on them I

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,200
think around here is regulated so like

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,760
0.7 meters per second or something and

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,860
that's it'll never go faster than that

00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,210
it can only be delayed essentially and

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,530
when it robots delayed you can imagine

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,390
that does interesting things for the

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,370
schedule where now you have to replan

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,770
that you know this robot is god they're

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,360
sooner than we thought

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,130
so here's a little cartoon to show

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,140
what's gonna happen so let's say that

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,610
there are three different fleets of

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,620
robots they're all trying to use the

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,450
same corridor or this more likely in

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,380
reality the same lift lobby because all

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,670
the all the past

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,230
tend to kind of converge in the lobby

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,580
for the lift where they're gonna we're

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,180
gonna wait for the lyft car to come

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,710
so it's interesting because the robots

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,500
even though they all are kind of the

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,580
same they're all sort of boxes on wheels

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,130
they're all implemented differently

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,510
inside and so each fleet doesn't

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,520
necessarily know what the other one is

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,960
capable of a one might be a very tall

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,300
heavy robot where it has to move very

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,980
slowly and turn very slowly another one

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,330
might be you know more of a Casilla new

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,340
shape or can kind of turn on the die and

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,020
much faster and be able to maneuver more

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:28,300
easily so each fleet essentially is just

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,010
kind of generates what it would love to

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,640
do in an empty world if there were no

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,810
other robot fleets around so that would

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,110
be great but typically they're gonna

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:39,370
interfere in some sort so then now now

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,600
that they can see what what the other

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,880
fleets are trying to do then now you

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,650
have a game right if you know what would

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,590
I do if you do that and what you do if I

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,360
do that and that game continues as deep

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,220
as you have fleets and then at the end

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,870
of it you can now have a score and now a

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,310
third party judge can be the kind of

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,720
arbiter between all those plans and

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,970
those plans that were determining of

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,040
other plans as it all rattles out and

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,870
finally we can pick the winner

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,730
essentially the winning plan that

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:08,140
requires the least sort of joint delay

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:10,240
on everyone's desires to the space so

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,220
that's what to do with fleets it's also

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,290
interesting to consider different

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,390
classes of robots so there are many

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,300
robots that do not have a fleet manager

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,430
shipped with them so let's say you know

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,590
research projects low-cost like rapid

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,420
prototyping projects or even a

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,610
standalone proof-of-concept or something

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,380
like that where it's not necessarily a

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,150
totally shrink-wrapped product that

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,590
comes like with a fleet manager and

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,690
technicians to all install it and make

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,490
it work great and so for those we're

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,080
having a fully open source fleet manager

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,020
which can plug in at the same level

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,690
these proprietary vendor fleet managers

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,970
so those hook into the common internal

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,020
robot software like Ross for example

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,700
that is used on many research robots and

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,580
then it's essentially a peer of these

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,750
proprietary fleet managers

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,730
so you can have these mixed fleets of

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,980
you know fully stream craft robots as

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,070
well as as well as kind of more Rd or

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,750
lower-cost platform okay so the all

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,580
talking let's go some demos what's going

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,890
on so I will

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,210
first show what the simulation looks

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,950
like you know come up a little bit so

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,360
here's for example a one of the test

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,120
facilities in one of the buildings that

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,309
we work in this is designed to be kind

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,750
of a mixture of a ward so here's like a

00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,870
couple people is like a four person

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,460
hospital ward here as well as to

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,590
simulate some of the storage rooms and

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,700
storage facilities so like this is what

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,350
it looks like when you go to the

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,059
surgical supply storeroom through these

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,860
little like lots and lots of shelving

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:38,860
units with sterilized instruments that

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,600
are in there in storage there's usually

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,100
patients in transit if you spend much

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,269
time in a hospital you see people moving

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,100
around in various various ways this over

00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:55,299
here is intended to be another kind of

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:56,529
surgical store let's see oh yeah and of

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:05,350
course there's always tons of people

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:07,809
waiting in various parts the building so

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,210
what we can do is now I'll show that to

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,309
traffic manager after I first introduce

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,230
you to the robots so this is a common

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,510
robot that you can buy off the shelf

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,549
it's a nice robot maybe a company called

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,409
mir it's it's one of the common

00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:21,940
industrial sort of you want to move a

00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,970
thing type robots this will move your

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,230
thing you can you can put stuff on it or

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,850
you can have accessories for it that

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,159
make the top lift up and down to lift

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,519
other carts that it rolls underneath and

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,039
then these are lower cost platforms

00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:39,940
intended for rapid prototyping here

00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,950
called Magni and let's see so now I'll

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,580
show what happens when the grand planner

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,820
all runs so let's see let's go somewhere

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:53,190
else

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:53,190
great nice trick you type one-handed

00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,350
okay let's run this demo so it's gonna

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,749
go very fast I'll play it a few times

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,909
because one of the funny things with

00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:06,580
with large robots because their speed

00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,479
limited to like 0.7 m/s if you watch

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,009
them in real time

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,899
it's like watching grass grow right it's

00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:12,039
just like that's so boring anyone who

00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,749
thinks robots are taking over the world

00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,799
has never seen real robots because

00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:16,869
they're so boring they will do it

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,529
extremely slowly you know it's fun

00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,080
you're fine

00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:21,489
everyone's are fine so let's see so we

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,970
sped the world up eight times here so

00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:28,690
now this is showing that same world but

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,590
with robots moving around so okay let me

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,599
stop this for a second

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,950
because there's a lot going on on the

00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,389
right side you have that the path

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,830
network from the robots that was a

00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,440
screenshot from that traffic editor

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,809
before so here we have a purple fleet

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,580
there's a blue kind of cyan fleet and

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,109
orange fleet so there's three kinds of

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,119
robots here we actually only running two

00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,769
now but they're gonna only move around

00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,739
just like railroad tracks on those on

00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:53,379
those paths at any given time the

00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,879
central planning entity is trying to

00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:59,109
predict the future of where these robots

00:24:54,879 --> 00:25:00,700
are going to go so there's a green green

00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:02,289
arrow that you'll see and that green

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,809
path is the prediction if you roll out

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:06,220
the trajectory in the future like where

00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:09,009
does it think the robots are gonna be as

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,690
time goes forward at any given time

00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,099
there's these little purple kind of dots

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,629
and that's where the robots last

00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,919
reported position was so we're

00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,599
simulating all this thing gazebo but

00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:19,479
we've run it in reality as well in the

00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,609
same space so the one the big white

00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:23,320
robot is gonna go from this simulated

00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:24,970
storage facility here to this simulated

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,580
storage facility here it's just gonna go

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,499
back and forth these little robots here

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,929
which are simulated like a bedside

00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:34,690
delivery real bone you can deliver any

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:35,979
items to people or whatever so those are

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,840
gonna be kind of just going everywhere

00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:39,820
when the idea is we've set this up on

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,950
purpose it's to be almost pathologically

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,019
difficult because all these paths are

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,460
intersecting on purpose so the central

00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:48,129
entity isn't gonna be sort of you know

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,989
stopping particular robots from from

00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:53,019
getting close to each other so as you

00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:55,330
see them go back and forth they will

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,979
stop and wait for each other as the

00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,239
predicted paths intersect over time

00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:59,679
you'll see some of them stopped like

00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:02,049
this it'll be a situation here OOP that

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,549
one moved out of the way it's it's sort

00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,840
of this like ballet as it goes on and

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,669
you can imagine this gets even more

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,860
complex as we have more levels to it or

00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:11,170
more more robust to the situation

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,370
so it's a little hard to see what would

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,750
have happened because we're not showing

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,340
what would have happened if you didn't

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,100
you know have this central planner

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,059
telling people to stop and start but so

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,980
you have to sort of believe me when I

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,200
say that it it's not good it's just a

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,190
train wreck it's not training it's it's

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,720
not like a traffic jam right I said

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,160
let's say on the road outside no one

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,960
follows the rules and no one follows the

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,429
traffic signals or the stop signs and

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,890
you just like you know just giant

00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:35,530
gridlock that's what can happen and with

00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,210
these robots and you know the goal is to

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,040
make this thing scalable so that when

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,660
you want to add n plus 1 or M plus 2

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,730
robots the future it's no big deal and

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,260
so you can imagine a future world in a

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,700
few years or who knows when when

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,620
there'll be 10 times as many robots as

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,520
there are now where this type of a

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,559
system will become increasingly

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,950
important to prevent these traffic jams

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:59,290
from happening so I'll let this thing

00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:00,610
play it's kind of fun to watch so again

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,169
it's almost like the software is running

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,030
really well when there's no obvious

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:05,230
traffic jams happening which is a little

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,840
bit you're kind of like proven negative

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,309
but you know it's ok you can imagine

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,860
what would happen if we just had the

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:16,240
giant gridlock full of robots here ok so

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,130
that's the end of my prepared talk here

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,100
these are all open source projects

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,720
there's some URLs and github there as

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,400
well as the the kind of foundational

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,870
projects Ross and gazebos are there with

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,000
the websites that does happen

00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,740
we're always you know for the fully

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,870
welcome contributions from everyone from

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,059
all domains it's a it's a fun you know

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,910
wide open space to play so thanks for

00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:40,749
your time

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,749
