Title: Be The Leader You Need - Megan Byrd Sanicki
Publication date: 2020-04-13
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Open Tech
Description: 
	(Apologies for the poor video capture)

Open source crossed the chasm into mainstream with users in all industries. Maintaining the users’ trust and sustaining innovation is key to open source’s success. 

However, in a world where communities are passionate, multicultural, and primarily use online communication, it is challenging to move communities towards a shared vision in a frictionless, sustainable way. Community challenges can impact innovation, putting user adoption at risk and even more importantly, hurting community members.

Stronger open source leadership can address these challenges and there is a call for more leaders in every project. Good news! Every contributor is a leader either through self leadership, leading others, or leading the community, yet most people have never been trained on how to lead.

This talk provides the leadership the training you need and covers:
- Why strengthen community leadership
- Key leadership and emotional intelligence principles
- Practical ways to lead as a contributor

all right I'm going to be handing you

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,509
over to the audience who are all waiting

very eagerly for your presentation so

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,650
everyone presenting beckoned birds so

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:26,910
Niki from the Google open source

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:33,270
programs office ok great I can't see

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:35,940
anyone so let me just start by today's

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,760
program and to be with dialing Berkeley

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,770
and I'm wishing everyone great health

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,360
and happiness and hopefully I will be

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,190
with you all at your next event and

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,289
today I want to spend some time and talk

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,910
about leadership and open source and

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:56,210
there is no better time than now to

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,250
learn how we can all be leader

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,460
especially during these times of

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,220
ambiguity so let me just dive in since

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,310
we don't have a lot of time and so my

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,600
main question is how many of you have

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,590
thought I wish someone would just lead

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,689
just pick a direction or just fix

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,710
something get people working better

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,330
together I know I have I've definitely

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,840
had those thoughts and those feelings

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,880
before and it can be really frustrating

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,850
but I want to use this time to let you

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,119
know that you can be the leader that we

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,820
all need and today I like to share some

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,159
of Google's leadership resources so that

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,340
you can learn a little bit about what

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,170
leadership is but before I go too far I

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,780
just first want to thank everyone for

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,470
making time today to learn about

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,979
leadership skills because when we become

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,469
stronger leaders our communities become

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,689
more healthy and our projects become

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,520
more sustainable

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:06,509
so with this talk I want to cover three

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,759
things what is leadership how you can

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,039
strengthen your leadership skills and I

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,500
want to provide some tips that you can

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,240
take away today just

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,180
applying in your projects that you work

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:22,820
with others hopefully that sounds good

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,510
and I would assume it is and let's keep

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,080
going

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,440
and I want to talk about leadership by

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,230
illustrating it through a story that I

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,930
picked up along the way in my last 10

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:41,090
years working in open source well I was

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,390
helping a project improve their

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,370
contributor experience and we did this

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,690
by interviewing a lot of contributors

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,080
and there was one story in particular

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,200
that stood out to me and it was someone

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,760
who was a new contributor and they

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,760
really wanted to participate in a

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,440
project but they were looking around in

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,140
the forums and the issues and they found

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,320
we felt really overwhelmed they felt

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,730
that it was a go brand new language they

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,110
felt that the interactions especially

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:15,170
with newcomers were challenging and they

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:19,100
they got nervous they were intimidated

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:22,459
and they just stayed away and they

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,739
watched from afar for an entire year and

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,989
then they realized okay this is not

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,709
working and I really want to do this so

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,140
they made a decision to get help and

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,600
they reached out to a mentor and said

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,150
hey I really would like to contribute I

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,040
had this vision for myself that I can be

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,799
part of this project but would you walk

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,290
me through the steps and this person was

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,049
you know inspired the donated time and

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,310
they helped this person who could

00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:54,910
finally go from being fearful to

00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:02,570
actually making their first contribution

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:04,310
which is great but it also you know is

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,060
unfortunate they had to take an entire

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,209
year this person though as they worked

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,390
with the mentor they had a real great

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,940
learning mindset and they really made

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,530
sure they understood the steps so after

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,390
they contributed the first time they

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:25,460
didn't again and again and again and

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,910
today this person is a top

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,620
contributor for this open-source project

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,229
do you think is just a phenomenal story

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,310
and this person really persevered in

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:41,060
order to accomplish this it's also

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,259
really unfortunate that this person had

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,169
such a hard experience at the beginning

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:47,360
and you know I wonder how many

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:51,650
contributions were lost because this

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:56,210
person waited an entire year per hundred

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,889
commits a year and I also wonder how

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,070
many contributions were lost because

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,930
people did not push through they walked

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,620
away it was like a contributor bounce

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:11,509
rate and the answer is just too many we

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,580
don't know but it's just too many so it

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,710
doesn't matter what this project is it's

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,310
really so many projects that I've talked

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,169
to that have this challenge and it's a

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,849
real shame because the story didn't have

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:28,759
to be this way because you know open

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,580
source is all about giving in helping

00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,590
people want to do the right thing it's

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,110
just that sometimes when we step in to

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:40,340
help we are actually stepping up into

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:43,789
leadership roles and we don't know it we

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,259
don't realize it and we don't realize

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:48,740
that we're in those roles that we're

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:52,400
having an impact on people the way we

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,560
talk models the culture that we're

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
seeing this project should have and how

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,370
we should treat each other and we might

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,620
have an impact on someone just through

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,990
our own interactions and it's

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,169
unfortunate because in open-source

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,789
we don't have training we might have

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:09,199
mentors that teaches how to contribute

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,080
but we don't actually have training our

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,000
core skills like leadership which is

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,080
really unfortunate and it's also one of

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,820
the reasons why I'd like to get this

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,620
talk just to start to shine the light on

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,259
that we need to focus on the core skills

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,940
as well as the technical skills we were

00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:29,120
working in open source so I'd like to

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,599
just start to use this story to unpack

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,539
what leadership is and let's start with

00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,150
who were the leaders in this story and

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,199
there are quite a few leaders

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,969
one was the

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,669
for moderator of people in the issue

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:46,939
queues there were interacting with

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:49,550
others in those different channels and

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,800
they may not have done the best job they

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,159
might have the best intentions but it

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,439
may not have been the best leadership

00:06:55,159 --> 00:07:00,259
skills being used there which is what

00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:06,020
made that person feel intimidated to

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:07,789
begin the mentor was a leader they heard

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,800
someone say will you help me and they

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,110
said I have expertise and I will take

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,289
time and I will help you which is

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,539
wonderful and then there was another

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:19,270
leader in this which might be a little

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:21,800
surprising but that's the contributor

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:26,599
the individual who was able to lead

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,310
themselves to get from fear into action

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,620
and impact and I'm going to talk a

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,319
little bit more about what that means to

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:39,229
be a leader in open source as an

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:43,490
individual contributor so let's start by

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:45,680
ask what is leadership now there's many

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,719
definitions out there so this there's

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,779
not really one to point to but this one

00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:53,089
happens to be my favorite leadership is

00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:55,490
a process of social influence which

00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:58,819
maximizes the efforts of others towards

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,680
the achievement of a goal and this is by

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,569
Kevin Cruz as a leadership expert and

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,750
the reason I like this is because it is

00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:08,870
about influence you can lead from

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,839
anywhere it's not about authority in the

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,580
role or position that you have and it's

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,849
about working with others and

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,180
influencing others towards a common goal

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:22,969
that you both want to achieve together

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,300
and sometimes to understand what

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:29,810
something is it's good to see what it is

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,709
not so leadership as I said it's not a

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:36,440
title it's not a role it's also not a

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:39,289
specific personality type it's not all

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,250
the extroverts out there you can be an

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,750
introvert and also be a leader it's also

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,060
important to note that leadership is not

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,340
management it is not about making sure

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:54,090
people do things on time and on

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:58,500
that's management and leadership is not

00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:00,290
about power it is not about commanding

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,180
that people do things it is about

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,830
influencing that's where real

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:10,400
transformational change happens and

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,810
there are three types of leadership

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,560
there's the kind that we know the most

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:19,320
leading organizations whether it's a CEO

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,320
for a baby a fellow of a community or

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,830
maybe it's the board in the executive

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,600
director of an open source foundation

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,670
another type of leadership is leading

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,240
others so this might be a product

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,030
manager at a company that's working

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,300
across many functions marketing and

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,540
sales engineering lots of different

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:47,480
functions to create and push a product

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:53,190
out to market an open source it might be

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:57,750
managing a bunch of mentors working in a

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:59,880
group of tech raters etc etc and then

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,920
the third one is leading yourself and

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,860
this is what that contributor did in the

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,040
story that I told they won themselves

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,910
they were able to manage their emotions

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:15,410
and work with others to create an

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,670
outcome that they wanted to create and

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,310
what's important about these three

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:24,180
levels is that you can't lead others

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:27,480
until you can lead yourself and that's

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,240
because the higher up you go the more

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,400
people you start leading the more

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,640
responsibilities you take on with your

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,820
leadership the more stress you take on

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,730
and the more responsibility and you have

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,840
to stay calm and centered and be able to

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,480
make decisions and hard times so that

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,790
people feel confident and can follow you

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,920
want to follow you and you know where to

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,330
send them you know how to point them in

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,570
the right direction and get them working

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,640
and focused and that takes self

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,040
leadership to do that really knowing how

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,330
to control those emotions so I'm going

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,570
to spend a lot of time

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,750
on this level deleting yourself aspect

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,750
today

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:17,310
so as we're leading what do the leaders

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,410
do well you'll see it was very much

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,660
illustrated in the story the shape of

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:27,480
vision they translate that mission into

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:30,269
strategy we get others to help them you

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,300
know work towards that vision we have

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:37,560
measurable results we know what success

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,120
looks like and they focus on that and as

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,390
they're working they foster innovation

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,089
in learning and they lead themselves

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,980
while they do all of this and that's

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,279
exactly what the individual contributor

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,040
did in my story their vision was I want

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,170
to contribute and they came up with a

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,149
strategy I'm going to ask a mentor to

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,790
help me I'm going to get out of this

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:03,060
whole frozen state that I'm in and they

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,190
recruited a mentor and that mentor said

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,800
yes I will help you I will be part of

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:13,170
your team and they had a very measurable

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:15,560
result one contribution right and this

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,640
contributor had that learning mindset

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,010
you learn how to make that one

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,140
contribution and then he did it again

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,839
and again and again to make him know a

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,240
top contributor on this project and he

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,130
did all of this by leading himself he

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,190
knew he was scared and he knew he was

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,230
stuck and he did he manage those

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,810
emotions and came up with a strategy to

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:43,560
move forward so he achieved his vision

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:47,430
and so as leaders they want to use

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,920
skills and these are some leadership

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,589
skills that are identified from research

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,190
from the Harvard Business Review and so

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:58,980
you'll see a lot of it is inspire and

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,920
motivate display integrity and honesty

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:06,350
drive results communicate collaborate

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,480
build relationships and lots more and

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,029
what I find interesting about this list

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,820
is it's not about the technical skills

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,769
that you have it is about your core

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,279
skills your

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:21,569
ability to work with others and

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,179
additional research looked into this and

00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:27,139
found that two-thirds of leadership is

00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,999
dependent on emotional intelligence

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,739
which is really interesting because we

00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:35,129
don't talk about emotional intelligence

00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:37,319
very much an open source we actually

00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,939
don't even talk about it much in society

00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:43,529
as a whole which is a whole other

00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:46,410
problem what we focus on a lot are our

00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:49,819
cognitive abilities and that's because

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:54,839
we are really good at solving problems

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:57,569
we even celebrate it but if we want to

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,759
be leaders in open source at any level

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:01,470
we clearly need to focus on emotional

00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,569
intelligence if we want to be better

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:10,129
leaders and open source and clearly we

00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:13,649
should want good emotional intelligence

00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:15,059
because according to Dan Goleman who

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,939
wrote the book on emotional intelligence

00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,259
you said that it's emotional

00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:22,069
intelligence that makes its top

00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,420
performers and it makes our

00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:27,389
contributions stronger to our project

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,009
when you have emotional intelligence and

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,799
so he says that it's actually the

00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:34,079
difference between what makes you a good

00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,360
contributor and a great contributor like

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,329
90% of that difference is emotional

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,129
intelligence and the best way to explain

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,939
this is if there were two people in the

00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:49,429
audience that had the same cognitive

00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:52,079
abilities but the person on the right

00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:54,949
intelligence they're going to make a

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,329
stronger impact in the project and

00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:00,689
that's because they're going to know how

00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,819
to work with others and set that vision

00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:05,429
and influence others to rally around

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,069
that vision and make it happen and when

00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:14,639
you work with others you make a stronger

00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:16,860
impact than when you work alone so while

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,809
our cognitive abilities are great and

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,470
open source and we solve so many hard

00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:24,299
problems with them ultimately we need to

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,959
focus on emotional intelligence our

00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,400
cognitive skills will only get us so far

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,040
but

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,960
social intelligence can grow and that's

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,120
the great thing is that we actually can

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,260
grow our emotional intelligence skills

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,630
by practicing it so I want to dive in a

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,100
little bit into what is this emotional

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,810
intelligence that makes us better

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:50,120
leaders and simply put it's being able

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,850
to understand your emotions and the

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,220
effect on others as well as your ability

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,880
to understand and influence the emotion

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,930
of others and this is all comes from Dan

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,220
Goldman's book emotional intelligence

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,840
and he brings emotional intelligence

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:11,810
down into five pillars self-awareness

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:15,260
self-regulation motivation which are all

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,710
related to managing your emotions the

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,830
other two pillars are empathy and having

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,510
social skills and this is about

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,850
influencing the emotions of others and

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,220
you really need to have strength in all

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:32,960
five pillars to be really strong in

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,910
emotional intelligence but we don't have

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,740
enough time to get into all of this I'm

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,950
just going to focus on self awareness

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:44,630
and self regulation because really they

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:48,170
are two sides of the same coin and what

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:51,230
research shows is that when you

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,900
strengthen these two pillars you have

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,760
created a foundation to unlock and

00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:01,250
strengthen the others so you have to

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:03,260
start here anyhow so self-awareness is

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,200
the ability to recognize your feelings

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,750
and they affect on others and people

00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,230
with self-awareness have more confidence

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,350
you have a more realistic assessment of

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,110
themselves and probably for that reason

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,209
people with more self-awareness you want

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,730
to laugh at themselves they can accept

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:27,050
that they're human and what they're good

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:30,580
at what they're not good at and that is

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:33,620
an element of self-awareness to focus on

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:38,150
where self-regulation is the ability to

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:40,130
control and shift your motion so you can

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,960
have a positive interaction with someone

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,880
else

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,510
and people who consult regulate are more

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,460
comfortable with ambiguity and change

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,460
they can definitely see that there's

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,919
something happening and they can control

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,980
those emotions and they can figure out

00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:02,210
how to respond versus react which we'll

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:04,279
get into later so you can see this is a

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,000
awareness and self-regulation that those

00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,770
two work hand in hand and the

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,929
contributor was definitely self-aware

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,809
enough to realize he was stuck he was

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:16,580
emotionally frozen and then he used

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,010
self-regulation to work through his fear

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,409
and ask for help and convince someone or

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,820
simply influence someone to donate a few

00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:27,289
hours of their time to help him with

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:30,049
this goal but that is areas we really

00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:33,260
want to focus on if you want to grow our

00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,750
emotional intelligence so before we talk

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,399
about how to do that I just want to and

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,350
won't be able to see you so we'll just

00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:43,299
kind of use a little trust here

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:46,190
so how would you rate yourself awareness

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:48,320
think about that a bit maybe you want to

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,270
raise your hand if you have if you think

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,679
you rate high with self-awareness like

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:59,899
if you think you have strong self

00:18:51,679 --> 00:19:02,390
awareness well I can't see what the room

00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:04,669
is doing but if you don't have a lot of

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,590
people raising their hands that's okay

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:12,919
because according to Dan Coleman's

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:17,120
research only 36% of people identify as

00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:21,289
having strong self awareness so that is

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,809
rather curious and explains a lot about

00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:28,130
interactions in general why we sometimes

00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:30,140
have conflicts as humans and but the

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:34,390
nice things that we can raise that

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,390
number through practice and

00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:41,630
interestingly the first way to improve

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,399
civil we're in a self regulation and

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:49,059
therefore emotional intelligence is

00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:51,740
through mindfulness which I was rather

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:55,020
surprised with when I started doing this

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,120
research myself and when someone told me

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,990
practice mindfulness they recommended

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,400
journaling meditating yoga and I'm

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,680
thinking why would it be a bit later but

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,600
I don't want like just you know sit

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,830
quietly or do these things like I want

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,020
to do I wouldn't be I'm very

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,660
action-oriented I wanted to do something

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,710
and so I had a really hard time with

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,660
this concept and I kind of dug in a

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,420
little bit more and Google has done a

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,130
lot of research in this area and they

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:28,890
have actually embraced mindfulness

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:31,860
because they have found the impacts from

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,340
a neural neuro scientific perspective

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,650
and how calming the limbic system with

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,800
mindfulness allows you to control your

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,290
emotions much better therefore be a

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:47,460
better leader in times of chaos and

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,780
change and ambiguity and as I was

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,400
looking into this research and I'm

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,990
thinking I don't know like this isn't

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,180
for me I'm not gonna practice

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,940
mindfulness to be a leader like I did

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,730
the logic but like to actually change my

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,210
behavior that's a lot harder and I

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,800
needed to have a stronger Y to get Nene

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,520
to change and I wanted to share that

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,080
with you in case that just hearing like

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,740
oh just do some yoga you'll be a better

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,850
leader isn't resonating with you either

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:22,470
so let me share a little bit about Dan

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,320
Siegel so he is a psychiatrist and a

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:28,470
leader and interpersonal neurobiology

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,680
and he has a whole way of explaining how

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,390
the brain works how mindfulness works

00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:38,850
and how it can make you a better leader

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:41,310
and he does it with this simple hand

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,020
demonstration so I'll do this but I also

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,890
have the picture available in case you

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:52,650
can't see me very well so he illustrates

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:55,140
the brain using a hand and the arm and

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,000
the wrist is your spinal cord going into

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,460
the base of your skull maybe if I go

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,790
ahead an angle it's better this is the

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,390
base of your skull and your thumb is

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,600
your limb

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:11,250
system and that's your fight like fries

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:16,350
and your hand and the fork fingers that

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:19,950
is your cortex and then the fingernails

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,410
where the fingers are touching the thumb

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,630
that's your prefrontal cortex this

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,360
cortex the prefrontal cortex creepers 2

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,540
is the upstairs brain and the thumb the

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,290
limbic system as the downstairs brain

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:38,190
and when you have this integrated brain

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:39,540
you have a system that's really working

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,900
well and giving you emotional

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:45,740
intelligence because when the prefrontal

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:50,370
cortex is connected to the limbic system

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:53,120
you have a positive feedback loop so all

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:56,400
day long you are getting triggered and

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,020
signals are going into your brain and I

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,600
go into your limbic system and be like

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,860
oh my gosh oh my gosh something is

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,169
happening but you're upstairs it's okay

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:13,320
you've been here before this using all

00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:15,630
the logic and it knows how to soothe

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,590
itself and when you have this connection

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:21,929
with like a quartet the front part it is

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,020
cool to provide eight all of your

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:26,360
emotional intelligence your

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:30,510
self-awareness your self-regulation

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:34,370
empathy and it allows with the world

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:37,490
around you in a really mindful

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:46,559
responsive way instead of a reactive way

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:50,630
but this stimulus is gonna make you

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:55,740
upset it might be that working from home

00:23:50,630 --> 00:24:03,570
it might be that you get home really

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:09,780
hard it could be a fun and eventually

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:13,230
this whole integrated brain pops flip

00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,610
your lid and there's always just outlook

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:19,039
truly today for me it was the god part

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,450
I was we have a lot more activity going

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,710
on in our house right now

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:27,700
and I flipped my lid take a break and it

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:35,740
can take up to 20 minutes for your body

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:39,049
and to get an integrated brain and so I

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:44,179
went on in the brain and that when we

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:46,010
can be when we formally turn to this

00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:50,600
link this in grade would rate a lot

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:53,510
faster and we can regain that emotional

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,870
intelligence and be able to be more

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,269
self-aware self-regulated empathetic as

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,240
we work with people we're able to

00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:04,220
respond versus react and that is what

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,620
mindfulness does to our brain and why we

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,149
need a mindfulness practice so that we

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,669
aren't flipping our lids all the time

00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:13,070
because so often we're just going

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:15,559
through the day like this totally run by

00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:25,279
emotion and that is not helpful to

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:28,130
anyone and an open source we really need

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,850
to know how to he was integrated brain

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,600
and avoid flipping the lid because we

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:42,080
work in an asynchronous and online

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:44,769
environment and unfortunately that is

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,059
going to make us clipper live more

00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:48,950
because there's a lot of things that

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:53,000
happen to our brain when we aren't

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:55,309
interacting with someone in person so

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,889
whether we're working on github or slag

00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:02,230
or Twitter or email and all these online

00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:05,570
channels we're really at a disadvantage

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:08,690
because we are suffering from something

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:13,909
called online vicinity and inhibition

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:19,130
effect though our brains that cortex is

00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:21,320
always looking for cues social cues when

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,090
we're talking to people so that we can

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,789
self-regulate so if someone that's a

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,370
little upset or even they're really

00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,380
happy we know how its fun and it it's

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,720
what our brain is constantly

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,299
four and we get that a bit with video

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,460
which is good but when we are on email

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:40,549
and Twitter what not we don't have it in

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,150
our brains really hard time functioning

00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:46,340
and we try emotive comments but that is

00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:51,289
not what the brain needs to stay in the

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,960
integrated brain and so what's happening

00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:57,169
that happen as we're working

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,900
asynchronously and online and a few that

00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:03,640
I want to point out from this

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:07,070
disinhibition effect is first of all

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,169
lack of eye contact reduces our empathy

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:13,700
for the person that we're engaging with

00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:17,860
and so because of that we are already

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,429
engaging with people with less

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,190
understanding of where they're coming

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,380
from we're a little bit more worried

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,480
about our response and what we're

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,440
getting out of the community

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,289
communications than what they're saying

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,900
so we have is lower to empathy when

00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:35,360
we're engaging with each other the other

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,020
thing is there's this weird thing we do

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,030
that we project a voice onto others so

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,030
if someone is emailing you or there's a

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,250
tweet research shows that nine out of

00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:49,370
ten times we are ascribing a more

00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,429
negative voice to that message than they

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:55,280
intended so we're not in pathetic and we

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:58,400
don't really have full trust of their

00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,679
intentions and that's those are some big

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,429
headwinds to work with with online

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,100
communication and then there's a third

00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:10,460
thing that happens which is as we're

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:13,370
working with each other and we're going

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,590
back and forth let's say it's Twitter

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:19,940
there's something that happens where the

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:23,000
brain flips the lid and you are just run

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,390
by your emotions and suddenly your

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,390
argument on Twitter is really about

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:34,669
survival in terms of how the brain

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:37,490
functions it sinks and so survival means

00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:39,710
winning the argument at all cost and

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,659
you've seen this it's a very strange and

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,870
unfortunate phenomena called flame wars

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:49,680
but that's what

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:52,830
when really hard to stop that and that

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:57,080
is when we get to the worst great

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:59,160
interactions with each other and this is

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,710
where we need a mindfulness practice

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:08,370
this is where we really need to be self

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:12,080
aware each other we have all these

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:14,190
headwinds around empathy and and

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,160
trusting people's intentions and their

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,809
communication and we need to make sure

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,179
we're not slipping our little the time

00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,770
and we need to build up a practice to

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:29,190
keep that integrated brain as we're

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:31,380
working together and so mindfulness in

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,150
itself is a good practice and you know

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:39,510
we don't have a lot of time to go into

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:46,440
that I have had mindfulness is what once

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:49,860
you're with people on your project

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:54,630
you'll also need strategies for how to

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:57,720
it how to collaborate well area we don't

00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:01,890
get a lot of training on and so my pro

00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,690
tips are that you want to reset if

00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,090
something's triggered you and you have

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:09,090
to be self-aware if something has

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:12,750
triggered you and so there are ways to

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,480
calm down so that you can kind of that

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,309
integrated brain and some simple ones

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,670
are at count to 10 I think we've all

00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:22,410
heard this another one is take some deep

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,450
breaths and there's a lot of science

00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,280
coming out around how breathing and

00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:29,340
really health especially if you take a

00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:33,660
shorter breath in and a long breath out

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,780
and sometimes things that just make you

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,429
flip your lid are so great you need more

00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,270
than 10 seconds and you should maybe

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:45,870
take a walk around the block and then my

00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:47,429
favorite is the hot tea and the reason

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,770
for this is that when you have hot tea

00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:52,850
you are so focused on the moment of not

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:55,299
burning your mouth that you slow

00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,830
everything down and just

00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:58,419
was on that and you couldn't forget for

00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,940
a minute that you had another issue

00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:02,110
sometimes that's all your brain needs so

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,110
I like that one a lot

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,820
my other pro tip is once you've kind of

00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,789
calmed everything down we've taken that

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:12,730
break you've reset then you want to make

00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:15,090
sure you respond logically you're not

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,090
reacting

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:42,470
like this idea I like it proposal well I

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,470
wish it had

00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:11,610
how we study in itself in another

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,160
practice that I like to use online and

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,140
burglars active listening skills so when

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,970
I sound like there's a proposal make

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,280
sure their ideas and I make sure I

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:24,809
really understand them before everything

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:28,230
so I usually say oh here you say it is

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:30,240
and I will repeat something chance to

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,549
correct me if I didn't hit something

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,650
right and then I can build off of that

00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:36,330
and to make sure we have a shared

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:40,980
understanding before I make any

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:42,780
suggestions and then finally it's really

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,960
important to know and switch to have

00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,540
been world or voice you know there are

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,419
just times when online communication

00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,250
isn't going to work

00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:55,950
whether is talking about strategy or

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:59,419
external heating you really just have to

00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:01,770
know when's the right time to say hey

00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:08,460
let's picture 2 p.m.

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:11,790
caucus room so I discovered a lot of

00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,940
stuff and I know that was all covered in

00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:18,990
a short amount of time so um I wanted to

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,820
do a quick recap just to cover the main

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,950
points that I kept I went through today

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:28,559
and that is now more than ever we need

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:32,669
everyone to be leaders and open source

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:37,590
and you absolutely can you can lead from

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:40,020
any position and you can't lead others

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,900
until you can lead yourself so it's

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,429
important to start there and leading

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,010
yourself means that you need to grow

00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:48,690
your emotional intelligence if you feel

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:52,410
that's an area that you're lacking in

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,000
and the first is this will start and

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:57,210
building emotional intelligence is self

00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,020
awareness and self regulation and you

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:05,240
can grow these areas do a mindfulness

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:07,799
practice because it's going will change

00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,270
the neuroscience of your brain is going

00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,070
to keep it integrated so you're not

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:16,350
always being led by emotions and

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:17,910
reacting will be responding and it's

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,610
also important

00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:23,370
just be mindful and he got integrated

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,110
ran he needs strategies at your

00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:29,190
fingertips so that you know how to

00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:31,590
respond and so I recommend you practice

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,020
ways to reset when you think you're

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,810
being triggered and use some of those

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:42,780
communication strategies to help you

00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:45,660
respond and so that you know it's there

00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,970
are some simple steps I'm happy to be

00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:52,110
available for questions afterwards or

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:54,090
beyond this because there's a lot to

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,150
this and it's not a topic we discuss

00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:59,340
much an open source but I do hope that

00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:04,290
you will start using these techniques

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:07,200
today because it matters remember new

00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,120
contributors are watching you you're

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,710
watching how you choose to interact with

00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:16,200
each other they're watching how you

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:18,420
treat people because that's setting the

00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,630
tone and the culture of the project and

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,270
they are going to mimic that they're

00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:28,170
going to model that and you could be

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,480
making the difference between gaining

00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:35,550
the next Top Contributor of your project

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,680
or losing someone completely so I hope

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:41,040
you choose to leave and be the leader we

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,520
all need so thank you very much for your

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
time today

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:58,100
yeah we can get Harris questions from

00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:59,480
anyone all right in that case I will

00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:03,680
attempt to paraphrase a very long

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:17,300
question from Mario to clarify him can

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:19,790
he be so Maria's question is about the

00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,980
role of leadership and open-source and

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:25,340
the particularly Google's role in it in

00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:27,680
dealing with the coronavirus crisis that

00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,030
we find ourselves in the middle of it

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,440
has sort of different character to most

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:35,960
of what we deal with because people are

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:38,780
literally dying is there so apart from

00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,490
the sort of here are practical things

00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:44,840
that we can do as individuals to develop

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,460
our capacity as leaders is there any

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,540
relevant thing you'd comment on on

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,859
covered and is there anything in

00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,650
particular that's relevant in Google's

00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:56,869
context on dealing with the ability to

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:59,600
lead on responses - yeah absolutely

00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:04,660
it's I've been very impressed with our

00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:08,480
CEOs communication with internally

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:11,240
helping us understand that giving us

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,830
clear direction and helping us

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,820
understand how to navigate this as

00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:19,400
humans and employees and in terms of the

00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:22,730
outside world there are many initiatives

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:26,330
going on and we've been putting out a

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:28,340
lot of messaging around this and I am

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,140
actually not properly briefed to tell

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:35,810
you all the details and I wouldn't want

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:37,820
to do it you know it wouldn't I wouldn't

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,070
do it justice by going into all the ways

00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,440
that we're helping I know that there's a

00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:44,840
lot of resources a lot of collaboration

00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,760
that we're doing we're offering our

00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,619
services for free such as Enterprise

00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,170
between suite now is being offered so

00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:56,630
everyone can connect during this time

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:59,359
and from where I said it's easier for me

00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:04,010
to speak to this where I sit in the open

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:08,240
source programs office we

00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:10,910
we fully believe that open source needs

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,740
to be sustainable and we need to be the

00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:16,220
best citizens we can be especially

00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:20,900
during times like this we are reaching

00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:24,020
out to the projects that we use the

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,840
foundations that support them we're

00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,890
reaching out to the industry

00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,560
organizations like open source

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:33,830
initiative and outreach and we're

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,830
finding out what the needs are so that

00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,780
we can make sure that we're there to

00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,480
support them as you know with event

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,450
cancellation a lot of these groups of

00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,970
reliance on event revenue and then use

00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:51,320
that revenue to support their projects

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:52,520
and we want to make sure that we in in

00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,200
partnership with lots of other

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,780
organizations that want to be good

00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,890
things are coming to help them and make

00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:03,320
sure that they get through this and we

00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:05,240
are also participating in something

00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,520
that's starting up right now called Foss

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:13,580
responders fast responders org and what

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:18,619
we want to do with this group is create

00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:20,900
a central page to aggregate people's

00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:25,400
needs projects needs and amplify those

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:28,850
needs so that others other companies

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,540
individuals can see how they can help

00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:34,100
other people in open source there's

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,990
going to be a lot of fundraising going

00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,190
on and one of the ways and there's a lot

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:43,460
of ways to contribute to these people in

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:47,030
need and these projects in need both

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,530
financially and in kind through

00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:51,140
challenge and other kinds of

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:54,820
contributions one of the things that

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:59,750
foster spawners is doing is starting a

00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:01,850
open collective fund we used to support

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,560
those that are kind of falling between

00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:06,050
the cracks that may not be part of a

00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,920
project getting money or may not be a

00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,620
maintainer that's well-known that

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,330
has been impacted there's gonna be a lot

00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,210
of people that follow the cracks of some

00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,830
traditional funding that happens in

00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,810
open-source so we want to make sure we

00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:22,380
have a way to help them choose with

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:24,540
Krita this fund so those are the things

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,630
that Google open source programs office

00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:30,060
is working on currently well that's

00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,310
brilliant thank you very much applause

00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,989
for me

00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,989
