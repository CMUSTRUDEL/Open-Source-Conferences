JSON functionality in MySQL was introduced in version 5.7. With the latest 8.0 release, a lot of new functionality is added like the JSON_TABLE function, JSON aggregation functions etc which will enable developers to get the best of both worlds; one can store data in JSON but at the same time leverage the power of SQL. In this presentation, we will see how that can be done.
