Upgrading MySQL server instances are essential to get access to new features, performance improvements and bug fixes especially related to security concerns. Upgrades are generally postponed due to concerns about cost, down time and also due to the apprehensions about the risk involved.This talk would cover the following points:* Importance of upgrade.* Different methods used to upgrade.* A new pre-check tool to test preparedness for upgrade.* A Straight forward upgrade process to MySQL 8.0.* Upgrade to MySQL 8.0 in detail and how the new tool, "upgrade_checker" helps.* Auto upgrade mechanism introduced for MySQL 8.0+ upgrade.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,070
good morning everyone my name is

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,070
Michelle

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,540
and really discussing

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,590
a woman for the sale of the statement

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,720
in this session I plan to

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,590
because discuss about the import

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,420
importance of

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,820
and what are your grade options that is

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,460
available for the users and how

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,530
straightforward agreed to

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,629
and they're going to the

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,300
really

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,570
and also I would discuss how you're

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,570
driving

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,750
so why do we have to grade our my scale

00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:58,260
installations general the new or

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,260
releases

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,369
and also the major releases do cover the

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:08,450
region performance improvement

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,630
and yeah the video is is again

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,810
has a host of functionality and also it

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,660
is important to reduce the death

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,180
that goes with your my sensation

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,790
that's it around 5.6 now and you have to

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,860
agree to a dot move the general

00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,670
guidelines is that you have to agree to

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,590
5.7 and then a dot now you would have a

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,060
lot of deprecated functionality within

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,720
five seven which was which

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:40,030
or no this would be complex and great

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,030
procedure for you to get onto a doorman

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,680
so by the great generally postpone the

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,720
users the general apprehensions that the

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,670
users have is do they have the

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,250
sufficient knowledge in order to give to

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,340
the upgrade or do we have enough

00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,189
resources

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,149
can continue to be afraid and of course

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,390
the timetable and the cost of curve

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:08,759
cases one has the cost incurred for the

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,700
DBS and bizarre things

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,500
and as well as will cost with the lost

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,430
business during the downtime when you

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,430
know switchover

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,100
at some point in time you do have to

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,069
agree and the general input from the DBA

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,630
is that they have to reduce the risk and

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,020
the cost involved during their parade

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,900
and also the deliberation that for the

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,819
bridge should be short and four thousand

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,260
one occasion it is important to retain

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,260
the order of my skill behave

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,870
and yeah they do want to test the new

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,829
version gradually and when switching the

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,829
downtown should be

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,379
so what are the upgrade options

00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,900
available there are two options you can

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,090
able to adapt upgrade or you can do in

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,130
case of me

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,440
it is a tough upgrade this is the thing

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,409
would be to back up your data directory

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,780
and then you

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,969
done the data from the existing MySQL

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,730
down using the MySQL dump utility and

00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,280
notice the particular vampire using the

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,110
new

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,390
my skewer and then

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,310
to quickly run the nice little drink it

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,800
gives you to not want the system schema

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,430
requested

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,430
the directory w16

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,560
and notice what you learned on file

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,930
using them

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,010
you're my school instance and then run

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,010
my lovely

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,049
the other option available is the

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,180
increase of brief menu again pack up

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:52,720
your data directory stop your whole

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,790
MySQL instance and then you take the

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,360
binaries to the newer my skill version

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:01,150
you will have to adjust your config file

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,730
to set the correct defaults and then you

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:08,700
start your new my squid server on the

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,700
old dated i3 and randomized killer grid

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
because

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,930
so this would be the straightforward

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,610
easy without defeated I agree and then

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,030
starting with my skin

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,050
I agree Rania Masri the brave in chess

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,860
or a sister

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,030
[Music]

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,030
Jenny you should be

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,009
you restart your server look at the

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,639
messages

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,569
it

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,569
if your apps and services

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:24,520
right 5.7 we'll metadata us straight

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,650
across of in different formats that's

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,830
your flight

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,830
as well as some amount of metadata was

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,830
Dishman

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,820
you might have come across these slides

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,820
if I have to

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,090
in a back door it's all collected and

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,570
stored and god-dd tables which uses the

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,560
unity bestowed

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,560
and it's all as though

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:05,530
so as I mentioned because you need to be

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,000
faster and should be the oldest so what

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,640
we have done is try to elevate the

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,440
legacy issues with the metadata and we

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,990
have transmission from the legacy

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,900
metadata handling to transactional data

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,390
dictionary and the upgrade process will

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:24,860
produce the consistent data dictionary

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:28,000
and also we have private health

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,710
or to what we have done is the average

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,580
utility furnace I mean as part of the

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,530
shelf we have a

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,380
we are pre-checker which helps you

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,600
prepare for the afraid we know too and

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,360
also giving the pretty hard and for

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,390
certain checks when the Sun comes up so

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,400
that you don't have legacy she was

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,400
getting into your new metadata stored

00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,770
first there are a lot of most of new

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,259
features people together least knows you

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,330
could look at the blocks as well as the

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,909
my skill documentation to see what

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,499
exponent and couple of them being the

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:10,550
branch will see the dictionary the

00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:13,370
atomically gives the GI is enhanced

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,610
roses to run time concentration and much

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,610
more

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,310
as I said there are applications and

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,080
removals and the features that are moved

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,930
are the query cache in the support form

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,310
the non-native partitioning and the

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,770
options that are available that have

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,870
remote is related rather governor is not

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,660
morning since we please buy a logger our

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,740
velocity which determines the kind of

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,740
warnings or errors

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,639
and as well as the option related

00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,639
so you are all

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,669
reduce all of that

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,880
it fills up with our management the

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,240
bossman option has been

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,860
previously you could create a user use

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,910
the grand statement which is no longer

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,090
supported

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,990
and taxes that affected are extended and

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,469
partition key

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,340
explain and /n was gives us an honor for

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:20,020
that

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,020
so long as order relax

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,110
there has been a lot of changes in

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,110
defaults

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:36,690
the default is a calculation

00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:39,660
before any of you

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,570
sensitive

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:45,950
the default preferred authentication

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,950
with a gangsta from nature

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,600
and the energy we are reading

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,710
also

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,970
system tablespace I'm sorry a separate

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,660
tablespace which helps and you could

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,660
drunk Iran

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,310
also like when our dimension to the long

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,310
line

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:20,430
as well as the other people relatively

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:25,580
from i7 you have you are destiny

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,580
oh this is reinforce your master key and

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,950
as mentioned the most important has been

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,420
the gas certainly should be

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,870
so when you're upgrading your schemas

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:47,800
from 5-7 to 8.2 what we do is we have

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:51,630
which does retain the the passive

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,630
actions that was used and

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,910
any additional step it's

00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,920
have the character set

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,920
and of the fully agree with your

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,380
the difficulty with you would have

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,300
brainiest leave and then he will do your

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,300
masters say your muscles are idle

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,860
for the new schemas that get a drama

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,760
master it would still follow the finals

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,760
because of nothing

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,580
and also the nucleus which get databases

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,980
FEMA itself the ski masks character set

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,980
so again you wouldn't be running

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,670
actually

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,369
it is part of the final seven releases

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,829
what you can do is you can branch out

00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:10,850
that particular tool on your 5.7

00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:13,730
installation and look for you know what

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,339
are the legacy issues that you put the

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,970
course at issue is different every clean

00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:24,220
up both of that at your own pace and

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:27,139
then and then proceed with the upgrade

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,549
so as I mentioned it's part of 5.7 it's

00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,369
an active development and we are

00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:34,279
continuously adding in more checks to it

00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:36,230
to improve the earthly preparedness for

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,790
your 5.7

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:42,680
and in subsequent slides and the list of

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,930
all possible issues that you might run

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,890
into a great of course not all of your

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,990
environments will run into these issues

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,910
but it's just for the knowledge brokers

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,910
that have listed all the issues

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,109
so the usage of you old temporal data

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,389
types we no longer supported on you got

00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:07,399
to so if you are part of 7 installation

00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:10,629
during your binary upgrade if at all

00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,629
it's been renamed you need

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,870
if you have perfectly periodic means and

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,100
the result keywords you need to rename

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,020
all those uses your video using a field

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,160
and be free this has been deprecated and

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,680
we did not do so

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,850
we will

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,490
the original categories result I believe

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,510
the my skill schema we have the PD the

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,510
table is created

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,520
if you have any

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,800
if the my skills email which conflicts

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,310
with these oh you would be

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,900
when you wanted to

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,360
and the foreign key names

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,890
[Music]

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,269
that's generally what table games of

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,480
justice to four characters where each

00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,630
character

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,029
three bytes and then the foreign key

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,899
game is not explicitly specified but is

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,899
auto-generated

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,510
that's for dieter's

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:16,740
and the possibilities

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,480
and if you have been upset all the

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,020
damage

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,020
over there

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:30,190
using your partition table and

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,190
that's older than me dotto

00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,430
most likely like the gis functions which

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,480
I removed

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:41,010
and

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,010
by a news event

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,610
all the issues that are voted by your

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,930
check table for evergreen command also

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,630
gets listed when you

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,669
every checker tool

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,669
[Music]

00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,560
as I said if you have people have

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,620
and Steam Mop which conflicts with your

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,700
dee dee dee believes the Jacana be

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,460
created in a dot no he will

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,940
the checker would actually throw the

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,190
warning

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,010
so it can be detected with the rescue

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,749
where are you why you're moving up with

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,959
my sis keep on him and the rest of

00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:27,200
and what we love to do is relieve the

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:31,000
tables which has a contracting

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,000
with respect to the DBT

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,950
as I mentioned there are certain

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,340
functions of serving people for example

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,490
white context

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,730
and you can look up from the information

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,730
schema

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,690
which are these functions

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,820
the what you have to do as part of the

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:57,830
cleanup would be

00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,830
SCORM we are our detective for the

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,830
functions

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,900
as I mentioned during the finally agreed

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,090
it's possible that all the or data types

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,460
maintained in the honor system but we

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,740
are no longer supporting anything

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,430
and there's a section that can see

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,430
monthly before

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,839
check table for a fighter

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,110
also the mice kill Sheldon a checker

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,110
would

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,160
what we need to do a little bit about

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,680
people so that your tables get removed

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,790
and you're no longer happy

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,790
[Music]

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,640
so once you run your paycheck go on 5.7

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,270
installation and frankly you're all good

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,270
to operate

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,300
so what you do is back up

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,390
you solve the Virgin rot my student

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,390
[Music]

00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:12,520
and a - well mine

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,640
and if at all as I mentioned we have

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,740
enforced checks to remove dreams in the

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,540
door

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,730
if at all you're a pre-check that does

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,730
not run clean and you attempt

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,300
we revert back off of the Cheetahs

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,269
that's way too far and we revert back to

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,700
the original 5.7 liter directory you can

00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:37,690
still start your 5.7 liter I mean Sarah

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:41,880
honor 30 me with your freedom and

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,880
as we will be refused really

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,569
so

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,920
what our great plans are we want to

00:16:54,569 --> 00:17:01,329
continue improving the great process

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,329
you want to reduce the time

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,929
forcing more checks and ensuring no less

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,929
issues

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:17,289
get the last of the time

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,500
we can't build the biggest melody then

00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,500
which

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,690
changing

00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:00,070
so for self-aware from which illusionist

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,109
of your daily labels in itself

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,109
so you don't have to worry about that

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,630
yeah it's good for security reasons

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,490
previously oh you are my skill use the

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,950
dealers you could go ahead and actually

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,660
do the bookends on to our system tables

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,560
and

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,560
maybe was too small

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:39,359
and remove the lead for last

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,359
[Music]

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,110
the mice killed in the survey itself is

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,110
no longer an external

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,850
great it's part of my skill

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,890
so the traditional I had explained the

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,190
traditional way of

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,410
now stop you will myself watching

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,200
wineries to the New World

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,590
I just still on talking fights for the

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,590
business

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,140
said transmissions from near would be

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,140
off storing the better day

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:33,779
makes it possible

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,350
with the work in progress

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,260
longer

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,480
being randomized collectively explicit

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,670
and we don't have to restart the silver

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,590
with us

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,800
while being buried and the seller is up

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,800
and

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,070
so when we're not lower risk in terms of

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,620
donors we have introduced

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,980
a check which identifies all sort of

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,980
issues

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,560
5.7 installation and Seth

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,889
checks and forcing more texture

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,970
and of course amenities are infinitely

00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,970
as I mentioned be happy

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,279
and will not look at me so explicitly

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,279
[Music]

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,860
the renewal of the masquerade

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,130
lose out on an additional step you don't

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,130
have to

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,380
[Music]

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,050
it does

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,050
and a big dog as well

00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:09,619
that

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,930
the changes that's gone

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,700
my shoes

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,700
and

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,429
that's your application

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,639
these are the resources

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,870
a lot of the documentation

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,800
what

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,090
so he'll or 50 milliliters which can be

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,090
down
