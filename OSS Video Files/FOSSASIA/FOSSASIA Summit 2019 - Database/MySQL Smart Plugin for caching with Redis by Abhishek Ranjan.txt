In the service oriented architecture a lot of micro services interact with each other. MySQL is world's most popular open source database and caching the data has always been a very interesting problem involving database usage design. Using cache instead of fetching from disk makes the response time time exponentially fast. In this swift world with manifold use cases for software, there are use cases of intelligent caching. This involves pre polluting the cache directly from data source before cached data is requested from Redis. Pre population of cache can be done as follows based on use case:

- pre populate the cache before starting application.

 This makes the application faster from beginning as required data is already cached.

- populate a set of key, value once a key matching a pattern is set in cache

 This case is based on sequential multiple disk access as application is executed. When a key is populated in disk, the probability of other related keys increases. For example, if when a user logged in the website, the changes of him accessing his profile increases. The use case is more significant in different scenario.

- Never let a cache expire

 Set a key/pattern of keys to a group which will always be present in the cache. If it is deleted from cache, it will be fetched from the data source and cache will be auto populated.

 This case fits best for the keys which are frequently used buy frequently expires too.

The talk will comprehensively discuss above scenarios with MySQL plugin for redistribution caching, showing the improvement with the smart caching and how to integrate it in some of the applications.
