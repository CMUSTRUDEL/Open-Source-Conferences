well I am going to talk to you live on

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:10,880
Randy B sub 5.3 and having to talk to

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,740
you also about accommodations like

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,880
community developer relations and so

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:23,189
forth and thank you Oracle once ring was

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,990
tracked because we realized that Brady

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,010
beads also got important and that was

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,160
absolutely no talk about it

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,230
no unsubmitted so an Irish who's one of

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,960
the organizers of MAS a while ago I was

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,910
asking now would you go and use really B

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
or my school actually the answer the

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,200
answer is really depends on your use

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,789
case right there there now to 30

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,820
different databases they're not the same

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,260
anymore when the exception of maybe some

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,840
very nice focus area

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,260
Alibaba will actually run services on my

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,649
skill and then for things to really be

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,120
so that I could go upstream most people

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,640
are just going to be like hey I'm gonna

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,430
hack on MySQL and make my SQL better and

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,939
that's what other people like for

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,939
example Facebook

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,140
as well so I think yeah things are

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,540
changing and read out very famously in

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,830
Enterprise Linux 7 actually he went to

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,570
use more a DB as default but that is

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,350
pretty much where everything so start

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,300
diverging route to 5 5 times and I if

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,520
you sticking around this track excellent

00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,700
talks a name zero so thank you pat

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,190
electrics so Murray give me so I keep

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,960
this straight out website today we're

00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,670
going to get a ball he still claims to

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,369
be an enhanced drop-in replacement for

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,840
MySQL and frankly that is false it's not

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,369
an enhanced drop-in replacement for

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,110
MySQL it is GPL fork of my scalp i5 it

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,009
has some features that are different

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,560
from MySQL and MySQL has some features

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,630
that different from ready B and some

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,530
features may be the same but most of

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,810
them are fairly different now so it's

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,530
not a full drop-in replacement you can

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,230
upgrade still from same ISP or 5/7 to

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,760
really be but if you want to cross grade

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,950
which is what the Debian people face a

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,050
lot because Debian actually went all in

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,239
on pariah TV and if you want to

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,549
crossfade between say MySQL already we

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,980
that's not not gonna work for you if he

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,530
wants to replicate between each other

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,410
that's that's also not going to work for

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,520
you because global transaction IDs have

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:37,130
changed MySQL has different GT

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,950
plutons action ID format provided really

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:44,420
but you can attach amorini be replica to

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,220
my SQL master and the rating we will

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,160
throw away the global transaction ID is

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:53,960
that it gets from MySQL and generate its

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:56,600
own so you can migraines - really it is

00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,710
much harder to migrate out and migrating

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,170
out probably require down and restore

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,420
however there are some cases were even

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,820
add up and restore will not work like if

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,590
you use data types like the decimal data

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:15,790
type mice ql decimal data type limits 30

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,740
is that still true 8 0 yes

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,470
Morini we decided to extend it to 38 to

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,720
make it more Oracle compatible so if you

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,520
decide to extend it yourself and then

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,460
now you are not going to be able to

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,200
restore that's not the only subtle

00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,520
change there are many other subtle

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,690
changes data types are just one of them

00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:42,410
so this is a wonderful diagram of

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:44,480
divergence and you generally say my

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,040
spell fine fine for small we're going to

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,610
simplify it

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,950
five my scale five six was kind of a

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,110
vanilla rewrite come back to five five

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,730
and five seven nine eight zero are even

00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,659
further rewrites morenae result emerging

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,819
after five five marina Mustafa

00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:08,090
cherry-picking patches after five five

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,980
so this is why not all features included

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,659
and I think that's that makes a very

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,940
important Mouse tuples four one five

00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,370
five problem list gonna be scalability

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,889
and lots of people love InnoDB and

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,100
usable UV though yesterday that I had a

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:25,120
I was at a phone call client and they

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:31,310
were like oh yeah we're using my said my

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,810
50:19 like why but social people people

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,250
still use my as M that said that's

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,350
unfortunate

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,460
five six also brought us lots of

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,650
optimizing movements in my SQL DB went

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,229
their own way in from five three of us

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,070
to have optimized improvements of their

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:52,479
pool so the optimizer is for opportunity

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,479
purposes same

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,110
and just to add some some confusion for

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,250
a TV they could've really not come with

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,630
documentation is you'll find that

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,080
there's this thing about the system

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,479
called Brady BTX 3.0 like I don't even

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,580
know why this number exists but TX it

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,680
turns out is a combination of the local

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,300
source really ISA which you get from

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,960
really be done org and it is services

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,720
maybe not fully open source from

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:30,270
mariahdolan.com so you may be able to

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:34,740
get things like connectors which I you

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,660
know Amazon will encourage you to then

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,389
you also get access to things like max

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,190
scale which is this proxy that is not

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,550
open source license right business

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,740
source license so you have alternative

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,190
policies that one could use like proxy

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,750
SQL that multiple MySQL and MariaDB

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,699
there is another wonderful proxy call

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,920
router which I think at least that what

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,840
we want

00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,230
the plasterer stuff that does not work

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,050
the marina now presents maria a cup

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,200
which is for proper extra backup as of

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,610
the source sequel log on other are now

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,760
the first back there

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,450
they used as well and then for an

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,310
infusion

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,230
there's also legal TX pasta which

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,389
includes support for gallery cluster

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,520
gallery cluster is is Mike is based on

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,460
the same paper that proof replication is

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,350
based on and I guess it's been around

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,350
for a lot longer that replication has

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,030
issue so probably has a lot more uses

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,040
than group application in production but

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,440
I suspect group application is also

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,520
getting a lot of investment from Oracle

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,110
so it's our season see if we useful

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
synchronous replication solution that

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,020
people start acting and I don't know who

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,640
will adopt it first but in a wide-scale

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,580
fashion that I accept I expect that will

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,320
happen and that is all district of a x4

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,360
column so calm story is actually for

00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:04,020
your sauce but it's not integrated to

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:07,050
break it is based on infinity B which

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,720
surprisingly Oracle only copyrights to

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,910
when they picked it up and the

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,880
Bankruptcy Court

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,660
so anyway key points for maybe 10 3

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,520
which was announced last me so temple

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,430
will come up this way

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,710
it has oracle compatibility means some

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,090
semblance of our how do you use the

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:34,890
Oracle database show that any way you

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:39,540
write pl/sql here ok so if you if you

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:42,210
fancy not able or your interfaces case

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,190
you ain't consider my briefing for

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,760
horrible compatibility and i think one

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,950
of the biggest use cases that have been

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,380
promoted by marie in the cooperation for

00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:55,470
this is Singaporean company actually

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,180
it's the it's a famous back and anybody

00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,700
give me a guess as to which famous

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:05,520
package Singapore has migrated to use or

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:09,690
the compatibility it for a TV TBS

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,420
yes so they I guess yeah one of the

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,820
earth to be migrated some 30-odd

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,290
applications I gotta be careful what I

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,780
said because it's been recorded and I

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:23,790
don't work at the corporation but I just

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:26,010
want to make sure I don't say so yes or

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:30,039
no compatibility most people seem to

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:33,399
seem to like it is it is it equivalent

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:36,399
again in Postgres the answer is no but

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,279
is it maybe 80% of what you get the

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,099
answers probably said you feel probably

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,199
the 20% that get annoyed when something

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:45,990
doesn't work and that because it's open

00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:51,100
source you cannot contradict it that

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:53,740
prime T most origins that people could

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,170
use so MySQL is is all I'm not in a

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,820
teepee and masquerade comes with another

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,149
audience surprising it's not you know to

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:04,149
be contract able the temp table sergeant

00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:08,649
yes so of course the kamiya-san still

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:10,600
but the reality is gravy ships things

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,660
like my raw expire and we have sliced

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,399
that one aggregator which is system

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,589
version tables this is a something

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,389
moving from the article from the SQL

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:28,000
standard of articles from SQL 2011 and

00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:29,500
it's doesn't exist in MySQL yet and of

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,449
course it's got some features from

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,750
Claudia but it's a really neat that are

00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:37,720
most likely that may not be mysql those

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,730
features because the reality is you know

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,270
learning to make it may catch up mice

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:48,320
government remove it

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:50,030
catchup that you know I love 10/3 so in

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,490
terms of releases really be aimed for

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,370
release cadence now of once every year

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,960
around the main time frame and a ten

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,040
point four is release candidate already

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:04,070
from I gather Oracle's Reis cadence he's

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,900
around the twenty four months plus smart

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,920
to because they only want to sports to

00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:17,960
release any given time and this it was

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:27,100
noting that for example five is this is

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:27,100
going to be interesting finding in SQL

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:35,390
so MySQL and really be of course a very

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,540
unique when it comes to start start

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,250
engines well it will vary to be fam one

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,320
would it be for now about three audio

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,470
service kept capability of having

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,440
multiple search engines but what mockery

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,450
we end up doing is they basically said

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,580
look we like this white tiger sergeant

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,820
and so they integrated it and they've

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,680
deprecated and disabled MFP one which is

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,020
the operation of my eyes --as

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,370
so I think MongoDB is a little ahead of

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:06,650
my scale from an application standpoint

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,650
that's and it's also much easier storage

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,020
on it

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:13,110
it's from I smell my spell you have to

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,610
you know provide for index types these

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,500
transactions are not you've got to

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,720
provide for you know backup backup

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,940
strategy you can ask foreign keys are

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,770
not jazz functionality is not provided

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,480
by the engine is provided by the by the

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,730
store jet in itself full-text search

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,250
capabilities Excel cause most things

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,860
make them different and morenae be if

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,610
you type show engines is a smorgasbord

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,330
of engines he has so many started

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,180
instead it looks really trying to get on

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,150
this like that so I have slides

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,560
dedicated for say my office inspire you

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,200
know maybe he's the people are read by

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,860
applications as SS been for a while he

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,420
used to be prone HPV but only actually

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,250
be features according to Brittany anyway

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,980
it's because I have been migrated to

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,070
towards you know deeply upstream there's

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,680
not much variance and actually be and

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,390
longer and they also have a couple of

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,290
enemy we have

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,750
looking at creative you know call star

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,230
is not included as i mentioned w oq

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,670
brough so what I don't have slides for

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,770
because an example is book you graph and

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,880
it's actually still gets changes to it

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,890
it's got something called abused

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,410
algorithm that actually returns all the

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,330
reachable if notes so you can do graph

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,210
based queries in a relational database

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,850
now if you ask why you should use the

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:36,290
Open Graph or do for J my advice is use

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:38,390
peel footing like Loki Ralph is kind of

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,080
like maybe a little toy so to speak it's

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:45,230
a toy Ralph thank you the partition

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,880
engine which is now still part of its

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,770
going to be overstated it's part of

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,540
creative eating but it's not part of my

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,870
school age because partitioning is not

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,850
built inside of the engine but

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,480
partitioning is how spider works and

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,670
perhaps rival spider as well Cassandra

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,000
is still around so in the epicenter and

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,980
Jim pretty central London he can

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,740
actually buy and live through actually

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,110
allow me to run SQL queries against the

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,860
Cassandra back and she used this today

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,120
my answer is also no don't connect this

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,720
is actually quite an interesting at you

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,070
because they can read same MongoDB with

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:29,820
JSON you can read GD for anybody used it

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,930
before before let's get emails

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,740
if you still happen to have something

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,570
that exists files you find a floppy disk

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,790
20 years ago like you've managed to find

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,230
your reader you can actually open up the

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:48,670
debase 4 files it's still kind of good

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,010
for retail operations but it's also

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,010
about that you call talking to me which

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,400
is based it's basically a engine

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,540
focusing on good insert speeds and and

00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,760
compression but I suspect that

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:09,330
eventually by up to this one it's gonna

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:12,550
take over that use case ten minutes left

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:16,480
so three DB has a bunch of aims around

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,450
smart engines it's it wants to be a

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,130
general-purpose database with many

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,870
possible sergeant so the breeding idea

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,690
is you shouldn't be going out there

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,160
using like a time series data base or

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,400
graph database use rate before

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,230
everything and you know have not even

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:39,160
true database professionals you know

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:40,660
it's across the produce cases but with

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,070
many charlatans it also means that you

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,640
can maximize the strength of storage

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,180
engine and minimize sweetness so what is

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,480
my rocks

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,990
my rocks is an engine that baseball

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:57,310
maybe it's a formal level maybe it's an

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,890
interface to Rock City and it's good for

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,540
right optimize for words you need to

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,650
install it right if it's not there by

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:09,690
default you going to install sewing

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:12,220
meteor rocks TV and turned out that

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,890
Facebook has migrated mostly locals

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,550
community B to my rocks and they they've

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,590
actually managed to stay running with

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,920
less hardware so the compression is at

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:27,130
least maybe 2 X 4 that CPU usage as it

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,170
has increased and it's based on it's not

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,490
based on to be balanced be blustery it's

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,720
based on a long structured knowledge

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,310
tree and it's good for compression what

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,620
well as it seems to be good enough for

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,580
right optimization and the other thing

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,260
that my rocks does is family also has

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,380
less white amplification so it's

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,710
generally quite good in terms of

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,060
extending the life of your Flash

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,830
presumably most of you are using flash

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,830
and not spinning discs anymore

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,360
all the apples of rational

00:16:02,259 --> 00:17:29,240
so she needs to be balanced to another

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,480
shot possibly and shouting is is easy

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,620
it's really shouting that's hard and

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,760
shining is something that my skill

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,870
doesn't seem to really have built in

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,169
generally speaking so they are

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:46,130
frameworks like toddlers jet pants

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:48,540
CMC FC tests which hours YouTube yeah

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,559
they actually put her in my scalable I

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,960
have a desk and we just is like anything

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,419
but spiders aim is to make sure that

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,150
it's pre baked inside the server and you

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:05,130
can write SQL queries to be sharp and

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:07,380
you can make sharps via SQL it means

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,720
some improvements around the partition

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,429
storage engine as well as the ability to

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,320
addition pushed up which means the

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,870
conditions get pushed out the Scarlet

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,570
area and typically spider needs to be

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,640
backed by in ODB as well so you can't

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,900
use all the fancy engines and we talked

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,270
about but you can use fight over the DB

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,179
and Brady B's likely to push by the

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,290
forward because the lead developer of

00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:38,100
spider now works and this is an example

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:41,309
of what you do in spider ICU your

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,400
application will good query may be table

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:45,750
on and he goes looking and a bunch of

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,299
rows which are basically spider

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,030
partitions and back of it and you can

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:53,490
create large large data sets now is

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,320
finer proven there are definitely

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,570
customers that using spider out there I

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,830
am there if you go to the brain

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,850
knowledge base you will actually see a

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:05,490
risk of that even is this you know going

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,310
to be more famous that's hard to say

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:14,490
should you amendment protects also hard

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:17,370
to say but it's all open source so story

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,860
lives excellent but keep in mind are

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,930
always limitations right so encryption

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,540
for example does not work with my own

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:30,150
subscription only works with you need be

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:32,100
an aria timetable storage yeah Buster so

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,080
a lot of things tend to work mostly with

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,600
Jessica to be first men maybe eventually

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,040
become because excited to other engines

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,510
then so there's lots of compression

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,790
available as well so you've had

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,440
initially wrote compression then you've

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,550
got page compression and I also agree

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,020
that economic depression the responded

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,860
magnet for Colin compression with

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,480
dictionaries as for what is really now

00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,820
this is a feature that also focused on

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,170
as and there are other repression

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:07,200
methods besides you see here this is an

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,390
example of compression so you just lose

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,860
your status my column will tell you how

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:15,299
many compressed pounds there and in this

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:20,850
case one so dictionary spot

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:24,239
in most areas invisible columns allow

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:28,139
you to basically remove dependencies on

00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:31,320
applications so in this case we've

00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:33,659
created a table with a secret color and

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,059
then we inserted some data and then when

00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,619
we do a select probably the newest given

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,960
to a select star we actually only get

00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:44,340
the idea a back and not the invisible

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,989
default column and and if you do select

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,509
finding in secret then you actually get

00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:50,129
it back and you can actually add columns

00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:53,809
to the tables without hiding them from

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:57,509
an app which otherwise may feel drugs

00:20:53,809 --> 00:21:00,239
maybe to Cheney or your schema of lying

00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:01,769
you just keep startled columns that a

00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:03,090
new application doesn't have access

00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,879
anymore

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:08,759
you can hide system fail columns and

00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:11,820
basically the next I'm not actually

00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:16,679
showing show it so this is something so

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,629
unique I guess there is the ability to

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,940
have instant add column but this is not

00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:25,309
as exciting any longer because MySQL has

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:27,720
Tazewell it came out every 10 cent and

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,299
remember I don't recall typically

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,070
probabaly

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:35,419
rectification like previously come with

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,419
data but

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,100
houses some murder tables this I think

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,870
is still makes really tiny teeth at the

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,140
moment maybe my still night will have

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:50,690
this - I don't know that's maybe that's

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,640
the other thing that's really has to

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,720
employ is that ultra platform - you're

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,980
so - girl who looks up there were clogs

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,080
when they decide it's time to open them

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,940
up really because it's available at GSA

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,310
if you are do traditions that you like

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,650
to go searching for what's coming up in

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,890
the roadmap for the future go check on

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,960
Tara now system of tables you all can

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,540
read that and typically can be used for

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,900
your forensic analysis many legal

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,320
requirements date data articles you can

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,910
most uses for point in time recovery

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,130
recovery at a table States to a

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,330
particular state and you can also make

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,940
sure that you also get any times time

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:35,950
later so you can track changes inside of

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:35,950
the database again this is really really

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,900
try for another engine and you may

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,670
actually start seeing big problems

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,300
and of course can also delete history so

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,410
here's an example of systematic tables I

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,390
apologize it's kind of small

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,520
- case the creative team will collect

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,400
Louise and I've inserted employees

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:59,480
colleague me is thinking that $1,000 is

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,570
a marketer among then soundos will be

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,490
Sigma is pretty expensive it's too cheap

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:08,540
right all right you are at the liver the

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,130
street properly so high so I decide to

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,400
tell the company now you can attend on

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,720
speakers $10,000 about

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,060
Singapore hands right yeah but of course

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,640
no but we got to be a locker the $10

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,790
notice it's pretty insane okay move to

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,610
engineering now right so that's a key

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:30,970
what happens examples so that you can

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,340
get it go back in time so now not an

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,370
engineering $10,000 and I can actually

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,950
give it to school and come across Asia

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,540
but if you want one with the history and

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,490
we can go back and see that when I was

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,810
in marketing they made a mistake

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,800
Jack my salary up to ten thousand

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,920
thousand then he goes through things

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,160
like survive stop ladies you know focus

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,620
some time now - state interval I'll say

00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,440
you know you can get different size you

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:03,340
can go back in time for a race it's very

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,530
nice and it needs onto this thing call

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,750
as well so you can say select from the

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,790
coin so this is some time with the

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,440
random types that what was I at that

00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,870
point in time and at that point in time

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,850
I was laughing betting thousand dollars

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,850
and trying to eat

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:23,070
in addition my skills always had

00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,499
auto-increment by the Oracle and it's

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,619
tinkle sequences which might also

00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:32,009
remember fields or sequences it's not

00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:36,509
meant to replace autoincrement a in

00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:41,009
reality but italics this is more for

00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:42,719
ability for women to migrate now

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:46,440
sequences to do show up when you do show

00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:48,029
tables so the way to prevent that is its

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,159
market angles so it turns out that you

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,899
do lock table it would actually know

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,659
your secrets your sequence generation so

00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:58,829
this is unlike other databases so not

00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,009
quite like but also available for you to

00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:02,669
use

00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:04,349
here's an example of sequences where you

00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,239
lose things like select Maxwell sequence

00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,759
so that master of sequence is supposed

00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:11,129
to actually get any color and if you

00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,619
turn on SQL mode equals horrible you

00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:17,579
actually can use organized attacks just

00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:19,469
like sequence underscore Nene Excel so

00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:21,539
let me be one person said they'd write

00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:23,339
pl/sql yeah that happened to write me a

00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,769
letter you know that you could you know

00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:29,729
secret about Maxwell obviously all

00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:32,369
packages exist there is kind of a

00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:34,559
compatibility by the documentation here

00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:35,839
I highly recommend it read it I'm going

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,969
to guess that most people don't use

00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,190
database as much as in the faucet and

00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,690
most people use auto service and

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,200
phosphate I suspect he used open-source

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,200
databases

00:25:45,980 --> 00:26:04,910
so this actually has

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,390
so migraines

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,130
- migration so yeah whose purse while

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,270
using hashing shopping for safety faster

00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:57,880
than my skillet the insight that

00:27:52,270 --> 00:28:00,040
migrates to feed you all music enough we

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,980
can make bathrooms my new great users

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:12,309
with empty behind 190 gravy you migrate

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:14,200
democracy I'll even have to why'd you

00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:18,460
stop wrong password of geezers it's more

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,320
better with MySQL as you like optimizer

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,480
names is out there the optimizer trade

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,250
history is also not there I love this

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,740
this is the amazing feature that I've

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,840
set position is it say I want to set the

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,640
buff full size to something like that

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,380
while I'm running I can say I want to

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,900
set a persistence of it so that wanna be

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:40,520
starting it takes time it's something

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:43,400
you don't get ready so

00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,890
I will be around here say that person's

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:50,390
la Trinity and its differences

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:53,679
feel free to sail up learning to eat or

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,350
write medieval any questions

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,350
like like what question if you have

00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,350
anybody

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,390
from wherever you get the presentation

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:09,690
for state 2019 the physician alone and

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:12,470
and SlideShare yeah I should have got

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,530
that slideshare.net slash Python okay

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,530
