Description: 
	16 March 2019 16:45, Training Room 2-1

MySQL 8.0 promises many improvements in terms of security of the database. It makes sure that instance is secure by default and provides enough options/tools to further harden security of the database. In this talk we will discuss various tools provided by MySQL 8.0 to help administrators improve overall security of database instance. We will cover various aspects such as communication security, encryption, authentication and passwords, privilege management, securing configuration etc.

thank you for making this making the

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,719
basket wrap pretty sure by Thomas

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:16,859
Sorensen ask you my name is Maya Maria I

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:21,750
am working on security features of

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,300
muscular and masculine and my session

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,189
today is about how you can improve the

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,960
security of your database using the

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,390
feature several about the transparency

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,390
you focus on hardening part of the

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,540
security or just a t4

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,980
okay so that's more as you shouldn'ta

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,720
see how the state prints everything I

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,760
say it's about Commission please don't

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,530
make any decision on cover so part of

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,960
motivation why is security hardening is

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,970
it important for database and then we'll

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,180
move to a different aspect of security

00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,879
company employment operational security

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,960
impact of security features so let's

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,100
more what why it's needed because of all

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,619
this so data bridge is more frequent

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,369
they are bigger they are getting bigger

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,369
every day

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,680
and they are getting expensive with

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,450
every single day passing now I'm just

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,430
just talking about the value of the data

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,950
that you are losing after the data

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,660
breach or the seminar or service I'm

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,940
also talking about the steps you need to

00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:29,700
take to recover that to proceed state

00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,410
you have to spend resources to identify

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,050
the course you have to mitigate those

00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,740
cost in order change the policies you

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:41,370
have to your publish to you know fulfill

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,630
the regulatory requirement and not to

00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,880
forget the reputation and the the

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,760
penalties for data breaches or how

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,860
services are getting severe if I take

00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:58,890
gdpr PCI penalties of this right so it's

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,670
really critical that you try to harden

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,229
your database

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,250
how try too hard on your application as

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,399
much as possible so that you know

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:10,020
how does a database play particles so

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,510
there are many aspects you have a

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,850
mission-critical database but it has a

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,489
poor configuration which allows certain

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,760
unsafe operations or you are using

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,280
overly privileged account which are not

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,530
really meant for your application you

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,569
are using very weak access control you

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,970
are using too cause of you know

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,739
coarse-grained permission fine grain

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,569
excess paper over your papers for

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:42,450
problems because replication no

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:44,340
monitoring which you have had at your

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,920
deployment but you make up side secure

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,110
so that's as good as losing your data we

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,420
are not using encryption you are not

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,489
using proper credential control of key

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,830
management applications are poorly but

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,930
there are literally hundreds of weighing

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,060
your database can be exposed and you

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,810
know you can support data each other in

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,180
our service so how not to do that so

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,650
let's jump in let's start with the

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,970
deployment part because that's the first

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,829
thing that you will do once you have

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:17,150
recognized for verify your package you

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,150
suddenly after

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,410
in your packet it's about so verify your

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,060
package verify the signature verify the

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,790
keys when you find the hash and then

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,640
stop the package always choose the right

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,980
packet for example in in case of max QL

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,930
we have already attacking for example of

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,640
the Tarpeian package we are various RPM

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,010
packages which provides several binaries

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,350
Plan Finder is just database is level

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,290
two devices enter files for development

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,300
of new plugins or components install

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,010
only only things that you need not

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,540
install or because if you are installing

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,890
more you are actually opening after

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,140
@exif is you're actually allowing

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:58,180
somebody malicious to go in and

00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:01,290
emulation those points hard on your

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,300
configuration defaults are good but

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,130
analyze your own requirement and pardon

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,110
them as much as possible there are

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,390
useful plugins which are available with

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,610
massive database use them use them to

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,740
harden your passwords used and to make

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,160
sure that route force attacks are

00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,859
thwarted and make administers don't

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,390
simply rely on - is in store I can

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:25,240
understand that it is very easy to use

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,610
the table G's in stores but package

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,590
millions like yo more data packages or

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,500
windows installers they are smart

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,080
installer state they provide a secure by

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,550
default installation they install useful

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,910
plugins by default makes your life

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,910
easier

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,400
what we did in mass here we started to

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,500
story with masking 5.7 we are

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,320
continuously doing this as a my spirit

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,090
of zero future as well that we are

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,820
making it secure by default while making

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,240
sure that it's not hampering the

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,130
usability so we remove tested demo

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,410
databases put them in a separate package

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,139
all the tests are now in separate

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,699
packages there are no multiple accounts

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,699
it is only a single local

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,029
[Music]

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:14,300
so this import and export operation if

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,939
not using this operation just deceptive

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,979
ii eternal will simply disable your

00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,090
daytime for export operations if you are

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,759
not using it the center

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,610
don't use symbolic links it's not

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,469
appetizer it's off by default you should

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,349
keep it that way

00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:31,819
general log and Lavrov use it only for

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,289
the debugging purposes if you are

00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,699
running into any issues otherwise it's

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,509
way too much of the information about

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:41,659
use if you are not going to have network

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,669
attached to your database use skip

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:45,560
networking it will just allow you to

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,949
work on the local host it's not exposing

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,139
your database outside do use SSL I can

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,270
not emphasizes on this option power

00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:56,330
doesn't matter how secure your database

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,580
is resurrected secure your disk is if

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,710
your communication is not secure its of

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,090
no use so please always use as a sense

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,960
always set up SSL with what it values

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:11,479
last but not the least always calculated

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,129
security patches are called security

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,229
patches for the reason they improve the

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,990
security it's not just for the database

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,159
from voice point of view as well so

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,080
apply security patches

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,279
stay up-to-date again follow the

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,559
hardening

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,269
the OS that you are using and make sure

00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:28,519
that you have everything that you need

00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:34,699
to secure your system is what is enter

00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:36,769
terms right so let me want operational

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,949
security what you can do to secure your

00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:44,089
run database server that's a first up is

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:46,669
communication use no default port I mean

00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,619
three three zero six is not for everyone

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:50,299
if a malicious user is looking to find

00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:52,819
out whether databases into my schedule

00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:54,019
is sitting there lightly scan the three

00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,269
three zero six and try to identify

00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,179
whether you have it bring it to drop it

00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,769
once you have it running at that point

00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:03,589
you know get access to or probably

00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:05,299
dinner service at the forum so use not

00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,519
default port but make sure that you have

00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:09,139
a power or a cylinder that's configured

00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,439
to all of those communication to those

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:15,649
process well use SSL proper certificates

00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,639
use authorize CA to sign server

00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:22,699
certificates and use them if you really

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,099
want to disable you know unencrypted

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,110
predictions are supported by require

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:29,659
secure transport it basically make sure

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,379
that either the connections are local

00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:37,339
that you socket or shared memory or they

00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:39,439
have a caesarian from cry quite a few

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:41,300
when you are connecting to server always

00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:42,740
use very 500 you do this will make sure

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,290
that you are talking to the guy you're

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,959
supposed to not do something else and

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,920
always use the latest eunice masculine

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:55,720
or supports TNS 4.3

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,819
that's a big drug 0:14 so use it for

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,850
replication quite a few change master

00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:03,850
and gr set up configure your channels to

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,279
use SSL it underlined it uses live mask

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,410
your clients so you can you know point

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:14,980
them to use assistant CSS a certificate

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:17,470
as neutral third of authentication use

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,170
secure authentication we have caching

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,660
shadow password which is finally 14 8.0

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,190
it uses shadow six multiple amount of

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,680
chakra which is attached along with the

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,740
sword even better if you are using an

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,350
enterprise edition of MySQL you can

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,199
actually configure - spirit to work with

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,110
let's say that which is configured in

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:40,329
your organization so use under use

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,790
password policy mask you'll provides you

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,529
be able to configure the complexity of a

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,790
password lifetime of the password

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,270
whether it can be used after n number of

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,100
you know and

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,339
and passwords or not all these things

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,110
are configured use it and when you are

00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,190
changing the password use a secure

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,560
channel because that's where you are

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:04,250
sending your password to the server if

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,770
your applications you know have cashed

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,690
the password at certain level we support

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,550
dual password now so do your password

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,770
make sure that you change the password

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,080
but your old password still works for

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,330
till the time you discard it so it

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,160
allows you to allows the application to

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,330
move over to the new password and then

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:26,630
finally you can ditch the word possible

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,790
for sensitive account use TLS connection

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,830
to verify its identity

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,899
ideally you should use a not default

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,360
route when Maskin server it starts it

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,839
reads who does the most powerful account

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,910
you should rename it to something else

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,770
always monitor we have a mascara price

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,070
monitor as well as various information

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,050
scheme of use always monitor your user

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,760
account evaluate the need of a user or

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,190
not if you find a user account which is

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,880
not being used lock it or disable it

00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:01,339
this is for your own safety

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:03,019
right next for this optimization my

00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,980
skillet not to you know provide support

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:09,649
for the roads it's very powerful tool to

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,259
manage the authorization you can prove

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,240
various privileges you can create a role

00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:18,740
hierarchy and you can effectively manage

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,990
your users to use the schools and have

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,990
all the permissions that is required so

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,790
use the words always follow principles

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,310
these privileges if you don't require

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,380
insert permission for an operation who

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,569
don't grant user names and function as

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,130
simple as time because if you grant

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:35,839
permissions which are not required

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,819
chances are that those permission can be

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,610
misused if your application or your

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:45,230
database was exposed somehow do not use

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,970
a single account for multiple

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,190
application it's very tempting but

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:53,870
separation of duty is very important so

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,329
that was no account of devoted

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,800
separation of duty is all about trying

00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,870
to make sure that there is no single

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,560
super user you basically make sure that

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:06,410
you have lesser admins which have some

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,980
of part of the admin privileges and you

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,810
just divide them between them don't you

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,399
don't do account of already application

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,680
should have their one dedicated user

00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,339
that makes your life easier and it's

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,110
better for editing in 46 as well and

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:23,540
again give you an improved Enterprise

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,780
monitor information scheme of you always

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,970
see what's going on and

00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:34,390
the implementers next up encryption

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:37,420
vascularity has ability to encrypt your

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:41,170
team Anita your read one and do log your

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,300
binary log using keyring plugins so use

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,290
it for your sensitive data use it for

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,840
instance that you've returned to the

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,540
data use a property server which allows

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:53,590
you to store keys manage key and

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,660
forcibly rotation policy anomaly if your

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,300
application prize on symmetric or

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,850
asymmetric encryption that is ESL

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,280
fitting is secret which is for symmetric

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,740
encryption and when an enterprise server

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,380
we have in the presentation plug-in

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,780
which provides asymmetric encryption as

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,930
well it also allows you to you know sign

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:18,050
and verify content if need be and always

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:20,760
keep your PC that's good

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,160
the third presentation mask you'll also

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,710
has masking Wendy identification

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,870
functions so you have a string database

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,250
string bass guitar masking which will

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,320
mask part of full of full content the

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,260
specific masking like you know Isis and

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,750
masking okay with masking and there is a

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,820
disc prediction area base replacement as

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:48,180
well which will convert one of the

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:50,670
venues to certain coverage but what I

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,250
think is really important because it

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:58,110
allows you to figure out what went wrong

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,940
so always use all reading and every one

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,450
way so text sensitive or always rotary

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,820
competitions on sensitive objects very

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,330
importantly what it failures because

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,040
failures are probably you know an

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,480
indicator that somebody is trying to do

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,760
something that they are not supposed to

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,830
do replications won't try to do it one

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,830
operation which is inactive application

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,940
so we audit your failures it's very

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,980
important when you are ready to strike a

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,810
balance so masculine was a really wide

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,029
range of order filters which you can use

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,800
when you are marketing you can configure

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,170
it to make sure that only the sensitive

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,639
operations are not everything so that

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,060
you don't be the try to performance

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,639
minority policy and protect your clothes

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,240
maybe write them on write only media

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,579
right once media and know you DBAs

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,139
access to those location because then

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,569
it's defeats the purpose if your video

00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:56,350
goes wrong you cannot really protect

00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:59,110
your system of mr. Moskal also provide a

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,569
firewall which can lock the behavior of

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,490
an application it can detect an anomaly

00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:06,360
and it can actually deny a query which

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,160
is education is not supposed to use so

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,930
if you want you can go ahead and you

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,360
know make it a learning mode it will

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,589
start learning the behavior that put it

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,300
detected motor-vehicle

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,160
just report the trainings which an

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,050
application is not supposed to fire them

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,860
and finally if you are satisfied you can

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,220
just switch amount of product

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,550
it will start blocking the waves it's a

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,130
white case the white is based and uses

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:34,790
statement digest it is not one they're

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,350
able to things like SQL injection so

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,700
make sure you use this features these

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:43,000
are why the Enterprise Edition features

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,560
last part backup security

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,500
they're critical for you you know

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,410
business continuity all right it allows

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,800
and service to come to same state

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,560
because you know after let's say in our

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,110
service center or you are mind living to

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,269
one of the soap or you're part of

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,279
autoclave always said keep your back up

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,440
put them in a protected media and I

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,980
grind wants me hear me right once again

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,720
many times media and always delete your

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,329
obsolete backup you don't need it there

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,339
is no example keep it but use a secure

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,050
unit function just don't do an R minus R

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:22,180
which is simply

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,630
and schedule book data stories this will

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:29,170
help you manage the downtime if your DBS

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:31,540
are used to restore the database course

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,620
instead every now and then in an actual

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,660
event of a disaster

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,840
they will take less time to you know

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,840
bring the server back up online at the

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,880
end I would like to you know showcase

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,950
the security architecture of my sphere

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,220
and this is for the community portion of

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,320
one school where you work encryption you

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,470
have strong authentication and policy is

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,110
turning on access control and data is

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,410
even flowing enough finally spheric as

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:02,460
well Enterprise version we have firewall

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:07,260
we have it as authentication support for

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:13,240
enterprise on it and keyboard as well as

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:16,870
with that resources you can take a look

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,589
at to further identifying you know where

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:23,170
you can see database there's a security

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,720
guide this specific your deflected type

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,940
and some white papers which are useful

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,410
as well as the blogs maybe continuously

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,700
put information reserve items so thank

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,860
you all

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,860
it's without any questions let me know

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,059
