Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Database
Description: 
	17 March 2019 10:30, Training Room 2-1

The database engine is one of the basic building block of any application. What choices are available and what criteria should be considered. Besides technical considerations, this talk will also highlight some non-technical aspects to keep in mind.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:12,450
this is my take on the topic sequel

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:15,980
there's no sequel I I go by the name but

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,980
 context

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,060
I also lot sometimes

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,380
yeah I'm exhausted not performer time

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,380
for Texas guests okay that's a job in

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:44,340
memory cache and that was sort of a

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:51,720
booty in my data file spectrums besides

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:54,809
a lot of other things and years XP is

00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,739
tableau database engine back in 2004 a

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,739
German setup box

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,870
without any as well so it's not sequel

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,380
so that name didn't exist by that time I

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,770
wrote you our end persistence layers

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,040
I did some database too dated bachelor

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,130
thesis and

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,110
[Music]

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:25,840
professor by

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:29,800
I hospice you deserve since 1999 so yeah

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,380
why these presentations because I'm

00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,170
involved with startups and see a lot

00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,900
that they make interesting choices

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:44,110
because they don't know better or they

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:46,180
go to obvious modern stuff and sometimes

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,630
things going on today that there's

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:56,610
suppose

00:01:48,630 --> 00:02:01,880
and they struggle the simple stuff on

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:06,690
those databases so yeah this is my

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:09,060
condensed things at all what you should

00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,790
keep in mind of course I cannot go into

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,560
the very detail and actually is this

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:21,590
about opening your minds that they are

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:53,600
love interesting at all so why no sequel

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:53,600
of course the first thing more

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,570
and there's a something sequence act

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,240
yeah there's a blog post and I better

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,090
account that goes into detail by

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,420
sequence X and the funny thing is like

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,740
at the bottom of the top you have a lot

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:21,310
of comments and links to of these

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,860
comments like what is like our sequel is

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,830
functional and so great but whatnot and

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:32,790
the other thing is like I hate people I

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:35,380
can write HTML support

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,750
it's like someone decided to give a

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,460
genetically engineered guerrilla the

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,460
opportunity to write code

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,760
and yes another thing that's the

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,160
impedance measurement mismatch so

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,270
there's the relational model which

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,340
actually fits nothing we write our code

00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,110
or structure or they even have like

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:05,500
object Cosmo

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:08,710
there was justification relational model

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,170
actually is doesn't actually fit to any

00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,170
of you it's just it's not

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:22,049
and yes yellow thing

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,420
everything should be simpler no see

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,050
Polish people dress you can just store

00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,050
the data as

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,539
okay I say synchronous pool

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,889
yeah obviously issues but something like

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:44,669
much of to misunderstanding counts from

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:46,280
the different approach of language it's

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,539
different from programming language

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,539
because the programming language says

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:55,440
okay it's intuitive and the ghost

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:58,830
equally specially and say yep okay to

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,430
this to this sequel is different equal

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,979
as a decorative style you say to anyways

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,099
this is this is the thing that I mean

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,910
that I want to know and benefits designs

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:17,669
from you what it's doing actually

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:20,400
carried to reduce operation well I know

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,099
there's a lot of legacy in the SQL

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,699
syntax which makes it really very hard

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:30,800
there's like a lot of legacy in every

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,800
kind of stuff like the UNIX the

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,720
[Music]

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:11,149
as a common standard so their database

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:14,269
systems which are distributed which are

00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:20,239
but which have a special purpose but

00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:23,269
actually also use as well and there's

00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:25,239
another thing that also languages that

00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:28,519
are in 2004

00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:34,009
now sequel databases actually look a lot

00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:35,959
like SQL I'm not so happy with their

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:47,070
approach because it's a lot of very

00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:50,460
error-prone and very hard okay

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:56,790
so yeah but you want to have for

00:06:50,460 --> 00:07:01,500
tolerance scaling yeah we are talking

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:09,320
about disputed systems and in the year

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:11,810
1990 the cap theorem to get better

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,910
understanding what are they actually

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:20,280
problems and limitation when I do a

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:22,890
distributed database when is that

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,720
essentially that you are there's three

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:31,470
things that you maybe want to achieve

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,490
that consistency availability and

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:40,010
partition tolerance but you never

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,010
achieve all three of them

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:57,020
and here is like a short try to put the

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:59,960
existing stuff into a category so the

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,050
traditional database stuff is more in

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,200
the CA but if you have consistency and

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,200
consistency

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:16,300
partition tolerance to try to databases

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:20,190
into these categories I took this

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,840
actually from a blog post from 2010

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,180
there's a lot of discussion it's fair to

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:33,190
go back to this stuff and it's quite

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:36,270
funny to see that is like yeah more more

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:42,120
MORE about this later

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,120
so there are a lot of details

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:51,030
this unit databases most of the

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:56,780
databases the first thing is there are

00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:15,900
no smart I bruised theories there is

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:19,760
idea what XP eats consistence to you how

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,760
it is actually dimensions of

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:29,450
no consistency yeah there's a guy called

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,519
Pillsbury

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:38,540
Kyle Kingsbury which is doing the Epson

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:42,920
reports this is actually a test suite

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:49,839
that he runs completely on different

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,839
kinds of no sequel databases interesting

00:09:50,769 --> 00:10:09,459
there there are some assumptions about

00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:13,519
consistency over 17 February coming up

00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:17,870
that I just wanna meet they picked some

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,149
some stuff here and yeah we need zero

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,860
replication protocol is intrinsically

00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:28,760
unsafe following the boss of maturity

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,860
documents so actually this is a good

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,420
thing because somebody is actually

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,910
talking into this stuff makes like in

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:42,900
points problems

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:48,980
momily invested a lot in fixing those

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:53,270
problems and formulate some ideas

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:58,920
guarantees that you can have on

00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:02,070
consistency when you use wood so I think

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:08,520
this is kind of groundbreaking stuff

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:14,970
that nobody is is doing after no sequel

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:18,570
vendors try this thing but you need to

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,200
find out by yourself like consistent

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:26,120
consistency the levels you get and how

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:31,800
to database in a it's not so structured

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,260
yeah I wrap up on this so you'll find a

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,840
lot of scary stuff about your fingers no

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,040
sequel database in the jobs report if

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,040
you don't find anything

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:52,029
rumble in the most evil paradise oops

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:56,950
we gotta earn money so there's this

00:11:52,029 --> 00:12:01,000
example right they it's a disability

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:34,980
value database the major driver boss

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:37,350
company countries also

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,110
invented my own they'll based on always

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,470
look at you can say only beautiful stuff

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:49,880
and they are doing goods but yeah they

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,880
met quite well until they were no okay

00:12:51,070 --> 00:13:01,780
not only be said actually quite similar

00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:09,730
timeframe in its initial release in 2000

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:16,300
2009 2017 didn't they did not end our

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:31,260
money and said that I do more money in

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:34,360
2018 they and actually negative 47 so

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm not good like in reading financial

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:43,780
reports but I think they yeah they are

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,470
still not on the positive side yet and

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:53,590
we need to see how our story our story

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:58,290
goes October 2019

00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,290
they decided they change the license

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,160
because they say they keep it like a

00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:11,420
massage are actually using their

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,879
products of giving back so we have the

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,290
license now that forces Allison to give

00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,720
back but what happened is that this is

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:24,970
actually what an OSI improve license so

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,970
they dropped out all the major

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,850
so there's a lot of discussion about

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:36,119
these licensing and that is actually

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:41,670
even on the sauce license or not allowed

00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:43,129
to get outside here's my take on this

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,449
discussion

00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:49,079
it doesn't matter actually whether it's

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:52,139
suicide compliant or not so whenever you

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,839
the more restrictive your license is

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,480
then the more you're killing the

00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:02,309
community that may not given up around

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:05,069
your product you have adoption you have

00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:12,319
less tinker's less information in the

00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:16,470
product and the chance that that product

00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:20,449
disappear is quite high because there

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:28,559
was no interest by the money community

00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:31,670
to invest in the product because change

00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,670
the license

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:49,269
these are is pollination area or car

00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:52,930
license

00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:57,339
Selenia Cassandra actually has she

00:15:52,930 --> 00:16:01,519
Software Foundation correct

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:05,810
elasticsearch uses a heaven ee h ee

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,329
stuff as their database engine

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,850
underneath so for someone who sees

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,960
actually makes

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:17,230
classic search is using some of those

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,870
three I picked out to set to show you

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:24,370
okay this is actually that at the other

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:31,030
side those reports are heavily backed by

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:34,120
a one one company but they are on the

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:40,410
other hand rooted in international

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,410
community what about the old guys

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:47,230
yeah Hospice well 9996

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,470
initial release there's a diverse

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,990
community they they have support for

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,589
Jason they have support for XML they

00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:00,879
have solutions for high availability and

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:04,980
scheduling and all that stuff but there

00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:08,829
is a lot of fragmentation if these

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,809
options it's different advanced there's

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,949
different companies driving to stop them

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,949
different directions

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:30,280
unfortunately there's no relevant jetsam

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:32,970
test if you want to know interesting but

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,130
no buts I think you cannot have

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:41,610
diversity in a diversity community

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,610
without any fragmentation so it's yes

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,080
my sequel yeah that's the picture all

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,250
[Music]

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:24,770
okay yeah

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,370
there's no single reason

00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,160
it's available and we need to be super

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,790
fast but there are a lot of different

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:23,640
other reasons that you should consider

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:31,350
when choosing how many meters are on the

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:36,060
project the community nature is stuff

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:38,930
like what I showed earlier on the report

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:44,630
form from Epson about Modi he was from

00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,630
2017 there he discovered major issues

00:19:49,660 --> 00:20:08,980
yeah

00:19:51,940 --> 00:20:14,640
so this is my takeaway I think to

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:18,030
advance it's not good in anything

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:24,040
special in particular but quite good in

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:27,310
almost everything and whether it's my

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,420
simple prosperous or commercial guys you

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:36,280
can tune them in a lot of things in the

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,970
direction you need if if you if you have

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,970
any special

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,850
your scale

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:56,250
how is indexing for geographic stuff

00:20:49,610 --> 00:21:02,280
phosphorus is extension you can do a lot

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:05,490
of things and no sequel is right because

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:11,000
now there are even more databases that

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:11,000
are specialized in a certain area and

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:19,620
know that as a as a second step and say

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:23,730
okay now meet i have application that

00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:28,710
has the specialty so then there's a lot

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:31,550
of variables you should know about their

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,550
semantics

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:42,410
