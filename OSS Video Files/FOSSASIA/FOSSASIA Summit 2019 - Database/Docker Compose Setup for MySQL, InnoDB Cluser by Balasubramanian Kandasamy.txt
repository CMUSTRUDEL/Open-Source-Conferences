	16 March 2019 14:30, Training Room 2-1

MySQL InnoDB cluster provides a complete high availability solution for MySQL. MySQL Shell includes AdminAPI which enables you to easily configure and administer a group of at least three MySQL server instances to function as an InnoDB cluster. Each MySQL server instance runs MySQL Group Replication, which provides the mechanism to replicate data within InnoDB clusters, with built-in failover. In the presentation, we will learn on how to set up InnoDB cluster using the official MySQL Docker containers and run them with docker-compose. This presentation covers a demo, including how to connect to the cluster through MySQL Router using a simple application.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,339
good afternoon everyone I'm parts of

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,370
Romania I work as a senior software

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,190
development manager in Moscow recently a

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,160
team and the presentation for today is

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:18,590
we wanna see the docker compose set up

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:23,490
for my school in early being cluster

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:27,119
safe harbor statement and the agenda for

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,640
today is we must see what masculine ODB

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
cluster is because with architecture the

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,680
different components that are involved

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,410
in masculinity cluster the vision that

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,180
because your master character so it's

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,600
about the master shell before a

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:50,570
procedure this is an ask a question how

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,570
many are using masks or used mask where

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,450
number

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,550
and as a developer you or anyone

00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:06,440
developing or any developers any

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:08,780
students any PBS so I'm sure that I look

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,560
at this master share tool that's going

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:16,190
to be interesting topic because it's a

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,580
one unified tool by both developers and

00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,320
the DPS can work on so can I've seen

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,750
what it does and it's going to be a demo

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,700
as well so we can quickly set up the

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,509
mass community question you're going to

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:34,820
see how easy it is to deploy or deadly

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:38,300
masculinity cluster setup right so let's

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,030
get into the immunity cluster bomb 100%

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,250
so virtually our organization record the

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,470
most critical system to be highly

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,810
available having said that this is

00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,399
record for productivity and us as

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,740
company like let's say that I don't want

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,240
minuses to town because that's going to

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,240
be a cost effective

00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:06,100
so what's a vision of masculinity be

00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,260
clustered us it's a single product which

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,630
basically means you wanna get it all the

00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,060
high availability and the scaling

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,690
features baked into it which means that

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,970
we won't get an integrated end-to-end

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,000
solution which is pretty easy to use as

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,250
I said like I said I just took me two

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,320
minutes to set up in early because

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,810
interesting so I'm sure that you want to

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,790
try this out after this presentation of

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,670
the Cortana memory uses availability'

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,320
operations so going back to the picture

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,110
it's basically you see the vectors the

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,960
out of solution first and we've got

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:44,680
everything integrated in one place

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:54,430
pretty easy to use and it's extremely

00:02:44,680 --> 00:03:13,360
scared let's see so for instance the

00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:17,680
first which means I need a minimum of

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,160
three service to set up masculinity

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,160
custom

00:03:24,290 --> 00:04:02,939
the next crossing is the master shell so

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,819
what it does is it's in plaster a

00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,609
tournament I said that you can use

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,290
Jasper assuming that I am a Python

00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:14,629
programmer yes you can use Python as

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,989
well and of course sequel is ready for

00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:20,430
the people on T given orders for DBA

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,620
it's like I can use the app in a way

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,030
that's present I can create instance you

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,610
know just

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,479
I can kill it a distance and all I can

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,069
do with one which basically is like I do

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,349
not love it to multiple instances we

00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:39,930
perceive what is happening everything is

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:42,720
in one place all right this is putting

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,539
all things together so as I said the

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,639
group replication this is the first

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,639
thing that's record settlers throughout

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:55,470
the configuration and master tell to set

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,930
up manage and orchestrate and as I said

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,080
it's one product and it is for a full

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:06,539
stack reached a solution and it's very

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:10,310
easy to use right let's see what master

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,080
headers it is basically an advanced

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,780
command-line client and a coordinator

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,819
from MySQL server and the best part

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,870
about that is it is called multiple

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:25,349
language or so which is JavaScript haiku

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,490
and SQL and it supports both document

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:32,759
and related models and what it does is

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,199
it performs database and also we can

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,139
read from all the administration

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,479
operation as well the first thing is

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,729
like on scriptable devops api expect

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,130
even use the whole hating gays are

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:47,520
available and then as I said it's a

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,330
single interface for both the master

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,330
peppers and

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:08,620
and we need a faster time ensure that we

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:14,060
get the masculine in every piece theta

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,890
so here is the general tenor which have

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,080
only used to adjust instead of being too

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,150
close for us and master outer container

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,820
is wrong which trying to you know it

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,340
directs us to the corresponding server

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,720
instances there are other and lastly

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,480
they were uses a very simple application

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,700
so in my demo I have selected good press

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,480
so what we do is we kind of bring up an

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,960
aha

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,850
now a quick law and then we kind of try

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,980
to bring down one instances and let's

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,640
see how we know we're able to get up a

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,640
check of the box

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,000
let's go

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,960
what didn't occur because of our

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,640
estimates the strength and the exits

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,070
trust me it's not that easy when you try

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,070
to work him over so

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,639
less time so what does it say let's go

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,150
to the directory structure first so I've

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,490
just got a directory called demo and

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,240
what it is is for the list of files

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,669
separately

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,060
so what we do now is let's see the

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:20,330
content of each and every father right

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,840
so let's start this server so let's say

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,789
the Moscow server doll can be and feel

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,009
how the pasta that's recommend to

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,409
connect to the server and as for the

00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:34,009
master book post so the point to be

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:36,949
noted nearest percentage which basically

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,990
means that I want all the containers or

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,990
with the denominators to connect to my

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,280
just in a production environment we need

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,289
to ensure that we take care of the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:51,440
setting because we don't want anyone to

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:54,319
know and this demo is basically the

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,879
sandbox testing and having said that and

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,139
we can pry it out but in a production

00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,650
you need to ensure that a particular

00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,650
focus

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,509
right so let's see we want them to know

00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,099
for a magical shell of env did you see

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:10,819
that postulate we have just bought a

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:14,439
configured for mascots level 1 so we

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:17,300
have for instance their womb 1 / 2 + 7 3

00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,249
the best far as we as I said it's a

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,979
temporary container and a for a script

00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:25,699
to bind up getting inaudible cluster set

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:28,039
up and a simple DB or SQL script to

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:32,409
create the database and use the other

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,409
activities for our WordPress application

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:42,050
so that's about master sharing and this

00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:45,680
is the company so far DPRs product we

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:48,410
just created it is positioning each

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,490
person and witnessed and upgrading user

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,130
and see how our coach and the next thing

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,950
is a brain or a thing Baron and our what

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:02,420
we do is we kind of see how I'm going to

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:05,330
be cluster is set up right so wonderful

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,410
here is the pretty part and it's like

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,360
Shels up tonight

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:14,930
it's which basically means that the

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:17,110
connecting your server one here so let's

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,110
see

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:45,540
right and this is what we do with Lexi

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:51,540
because it's a broker so let's say the

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,280
content of Kurata right so the important

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,760
thing to be noted here is ignoring Enoch

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,460
numbers this is basically we tell into

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,350
our application that we just need to

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,160
wait for the three math skills server to

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,080
be up for me to set up you know for the

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,450
router so this is a pretty important

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:15,080
configuration that we can share when we

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,080
try to set up and

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:22,509
so that is faulty monsters and only be

00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:26,439
not numbers so how do we get into penis

00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:28,899
so the copper composter gamma doesn't

00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:30,729
import fire which got the common things

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,609
over on it it's what all the information

00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:34,929
about our image so let's see here so if

00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:36,909
you see that you know experience is

00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:40,139
struggling with the free services and go

00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:42,249
here it is like I'm using 17 0 30 and

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,909
there are a few things that make a pass

00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:50,559
to set up and group replication so let's

00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:53,699
see what occurs and so the two

00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:57,899
configuration and symmetry is similar

00:10:53,699 --> 00:11:00,819
this is the requirement for setting up

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:04,119
replication which means that first as I

00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:07,149
need a law then that has to be enabled

00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:09,849
and and wanna go for - of order and of

00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:12,959
course that GT ID has to be any good and

00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:16,629
there should be a primary castra and

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,699
service on the replication Madariaga it

00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:20,709
has to be stored on the system tables so

00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:23,259
are you see options that are being able

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:27,819
to master in the repository and the

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:31,329
plate and Fortis Locksley obtains yes it

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:33,699
has to be enabled for the replication to

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,559
put and last as the right sector and

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:37,559
such extraction has P name

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,300
and so let's get out these are the

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,850
things that are positive that we pass

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,880
through this particular server to get

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,500
the proper application out and the next

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,440
important thing that we see is publish

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,660
in this market so you can see that it's

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,910
pretty easy and I bought my image so you

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,090
can always come to the emergency water

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,410
or to cash in fact so what it has is we

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,240
just need to wait for all the three

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:11,060
server one two and three to be half or

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:14,350
you know cluster to be set up so hand

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,890
set back the route that we cut on this

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,890
Slovo and share

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,519
and lastly to put say that there's an

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,630
application WordPress which depends on

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,630
the master program

00:12:29,340 --> 00:14:16,400
so this is so so so depending on the and

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:16,400
this is done by so one image

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,470
it just basically go through a

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:29,240
certification and configure server and

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:33,700
anytime judoka so it just goes prepare

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,700
time and let's see what proper does not

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,790
so these are a lot of things that have

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,560
happened basically not just get things

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:45,860
up and running right and what is

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,540
happened now is the robber is done and

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:54,570
configuration so we've got three service

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:57,779
1 2 & 3 so what we quickly do is get

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:00,800
this open and this the mascot in a TV

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:03,389
set that is company yes so that people

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,260
let's see this content agreement is now

00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:09,329
with our peers you see that everything

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,839
is whether this healthy which basically

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:15,000
means all your server yes so 1 2 & 3 is

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,760
a perfectly fine we need not even done

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,870
in a 1/4 so this is an application that

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:28,800
is you know that no application host

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:31,800
because that's how we configure it using

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,670
the relative that you used in the TV dot

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,740
s QX third the important thing to be

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,050
noted here is the data is host so what

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,579
he who was here we pass the mask a

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,990
router because router takes care of

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,760
dropping things to response over the

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,750
thing to be noted and rest is pretty

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,100
normal but Chris said so

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,319
it's gonna cook pretty quickly at this

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,600
you know get things are pretty quickly

00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:01,790
set up this is very simple and now let's

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
see for instance next day I wonder what

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:07,399
is happening with master rotor you can

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,860
use a command Marvel dr. Campos dogs

00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,730
masculine rotor you see what is

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:25,100
happening at each and every container so

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:27,500
if you see that so I just need a

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,470
password this is an interface that we

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:38,329
talked the mascot share which is one

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:39,860
particular h2 and I can interact with so

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:47,029
let's see how to do it but if all it

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:48,079
gets into your duster so but equally

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,769
gets the Duster

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,870
so how many click into one of us you say

00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:59,449
yes Uranus bill more I can run command s

00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:03,529
square in matter pipe is breezy shows is

00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:05,240
that three different language we can

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:09,169
perform both interactive and batch

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,059
operations and how we setup and cluster

00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:14,630
is neck now what I do is show what we do

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,760
here is you know we just say very

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,470
cluster is equal to be made of get

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,420
cluster the best part about master

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,730
the future and it provides you the

00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,830
different option that is available for a

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,660
TV to respond so I need not even

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,910
remember it as I said give me a dot and

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:36,740
tap you will get a list a function that

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:39,070
can be used in your shell meter plus the

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,480
rest is water it's the claim over

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,480
remember the way apart it does

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,790
and how do you name a dangerous lesson

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,900
top determine when a plea that they move

00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:57,720
faster they're here in our business

00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:03,960
tester so what we do now is we just see

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:07,010
the stages of the customer so I can

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,010
always take a spin to the

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,690
see it should match

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,260
don't be

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,330
one

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,330
it's demo server one which basically

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,120
means that we are clear

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,440
let's talk so one it's basically we

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,060
won't bring down this container and see

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,440
how well our application is kind of

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:28,400
serving and outage so is a doctor

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,330
stopped and imagining and even I can

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,330
also select a port

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:43,270
so let's talk someone to see what

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,270
happens

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,270
right so in case you can achieve is not

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,039
set my old application is okay and my

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,799
job is not accessible but I don't what

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,419
happened so you could see that I know

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,020
there is something that's growing up in

00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:09,610
the law yes known as Nexus which means

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,620
that automatically rows have been added

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,130
we didn't do anything much except for

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,750
setting up inaudible cluster and now

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,770
let's see what is happen behind the

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,539
scene to get this up and running and I'm

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,580
just talking to instance to just to see

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:29,080
you know what is happening this is how

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:31,289
we connect to the router so let's let's

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,059
try to get the classflow name first and

00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:36,399
and then try to get the status just to

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:41,350
see what is happening with our cluster

00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:44,620
now interestingly you will see something

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:47,140
very catchy for now what happens is you

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:52,460
know it has gotten in kittens just to

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:56,119
make the server to is read right

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,519
oh yeah this is what happened and silver

00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,210
one it's missing which basically means

00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:03,440
there's something happened illegal so on

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,869
and you could see that it's all length

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,669
the other one is later it's other one is

00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:12,789
gone like but you can tolerate up to one

00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:12,789
per year because now sever ones down

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,350
yeah so that is pretty things that we

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,240
know that are the different stickers so

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,510
what you quickly reverse be kind of you

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,330
know frozen another session and then try

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,700
to bring up to come the server instance

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,370
also container again and see what it's

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,300
going to happen so let's start the

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,300
topper start and

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,000
and let's check the status and you could

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:44,480
see that it's gonna take a while right

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,420
let's bring it down yes so once back

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,070
online which basically means our as

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,990
publication is up and running

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,360
what a thing is it a squad automatic I

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,980
don't know over to ensure that whenever

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,520
I have an instance market gonna add it

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,690
as frequently but as a user I won't be

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,910
able to know what is happening with

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:11,780
regards to the cluster so he is building

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:14,900
awkward presentation

00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:18,230
so if your party inquiries as a severe

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,840
political moves and this is a very good

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,780
resource and all these could be links

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,580
and it's in case you can press it or to

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:31,280
no practical our mascot that we showed

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,840
very quickly just a page where you can

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,840
download the master server the latest

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,930
version that give orders 8 0 15 so the

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:43,780
URL is Deborah maskel calm down notes

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:47,530
not much better and this is basically

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,840
the top image that we've got which is

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:55,250
master server which is which is our own

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,870
official master server topper image on

00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,940
the top half the scripts that we spoke

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,190
or the images available for free you can

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,620
always download start and I can always

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,110
you know the same thing but setting up

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,460
an etiquette cluster in two minutes so

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,960
all the things are available and evenly

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,390
you can always put the source code so

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,860
these are the proteins that

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,860
feel free to use it and share it

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:24,539
right so with that much questions

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,100
everything is free lattice or I said if

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,860
you can download it for free

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,040
start use connect including shell router

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:46,030
server everything is over source so the

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:51,880
URL that we we use URIs I go here and I

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:54,520
select the one for example let's say I'm

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,450
I'm very happy user and always before

00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:03,180
attacked these are my different formats

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:04,860
the mask it's not my source

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,540
in case you wanted all over the top of

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,510
Matthias this is what you go here and

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:13,140
then by you say dockable mascot mascot

00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:15,440
server you can get it over image form a

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,440
square

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,809
more questions yes

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,919
yeah

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,840
yes so a very good question so doubt has

00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:36,210
got two ports so 6-4 4-6 is for

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,860
read/write and I can always popular my

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,170
strengths with sixth over seven which is

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,310
a Reno instance and I can always get

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,310
math equation prior to that

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,070
