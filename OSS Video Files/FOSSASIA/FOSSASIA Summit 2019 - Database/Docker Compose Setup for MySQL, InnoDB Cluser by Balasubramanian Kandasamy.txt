MySQL InnoDB cluster provides a complete high availability solution for MySQL. MySQL Shell includes AdminAPI which enables you to easily configure and administer a group of at least three MySQL server instances to function as an InnoDB cluster. Each MySQL server instance runs MySQL Group Replication, which provides the mechanism to replicate data within InnoDB clusters, with built-in failover. In the presentation, we will learn on how to set up InnoDB cluster using the official MySQL Docker containers and run them with docker-compose. This presentation covers a demo, including how to connect to the cluster through MySQL Router using a simple application.
