hello my name is during the scene

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:10,230
Chauhan and I have got my support

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,429
application and I do testing on

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,680
replication so today I'm going to talk

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:23,570
about what's new in replication in

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,570
bicycle aid safe our statement

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,070
so today's program agenda we'll be

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,750
talking about the talking about the

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,170
replication of different variants of

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,780
replication my sequin and white why we

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,660
need it and then I'm talking about a way

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,560
for our presentation which is

00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:46,220
enhancements that has been done in my

00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:50,000
sympathy replications and all that my

00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:52,400
sequel for the replication so into a

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,920
speech that I have a technology mesh all

00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,809
things are distributed and there is a

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,390
large amount of data that we need to

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,120
handle to transform and it's true so for

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,580
example with having smartphones coming

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,580
into our life we have no nodes of data

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:26,690
so the thing is so I want to keep moving

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:32,690
down on social media and look at all the

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:34,370
pictures and all the all the data for

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,550
the money repurposed for n number of

00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:40,820
years and variety there is much more

00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,130
things that we want to store so extract

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,189
transform

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,979
do it as soon as possible this is the

00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,490
key component for us to progress in

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:53,020
feature so it's like the zoo and

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,360
distributed coordination and monitoring

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,560
is the key here so what is replication

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,289
replication is the process of generating

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,950
and reproducing multiple copies of data

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:11,980
and more and more site so for example if

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:16,510
I do some inserts on me without any

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,459
degree in my secret application we have

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,260
three different types of coordination

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,870
between the servers so the very basic

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,900
ones are asynchronous replication and

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,510
service impermanence replication so my

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,360
security application is in process in

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,489
which we write everything you do the log

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,489
file and then it gets replicated so we

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,910
are using logical replication so here

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,860
when we insert some data

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:47,530
somebody writes it into the final table

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:50,590
and also it in the sole so it's get down

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,230
for the network and we get only in the

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:58,389
relator of the second remember and from

00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,310
there the quantitative science focus so

00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:03,519
if there are multiple transactions which

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,049
can be penalized because they work on

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,359
that pattern so it improves the

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:14,410
performance and once it is written if we

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:18,130
have the top in our developers so in

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,380
semi synchronous replication that we

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,340
send acknowledgment back to the primary

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,590
so that we know whether this waiver or

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,549
secondary has receive the data or not so

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,680
it it is asynchronous kind of thing

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,049
now coming to the code the most

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,239
important my super replication which has

00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,400
improved or not in the previous

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,519
application said it might be different

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,090
scripts utilities to provide the

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,670
failover

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:51,040
and further in group replication

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,380
it is a highly durable solution it's a

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,709
very good infrastructure where the

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,169
members can grow and shrink dynamically

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,630
and whatever the view consistent view is

00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:05,709
or even the same view will be only with

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,239
all the members and we can have two

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,080
different types of Moore's of river here

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,110
one is

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,150
we're only one member will be retried

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,329
operations where all the other members

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,250
will be reading only whereas we can have

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,410
multi-prime you know where all the

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,810
members will be doing right operations

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,300
and it would be perfect detection that

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,740
everything has kinda automatically and

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,970
or the secondary routes the same

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,970
information is available

00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:43,190
so let's moving on to the announcement

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:46,220
section so far country will be gaseous

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,470
in replication we transfer some data and

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,419
through logical application it sound if

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,720
it gets out over to the secondary but

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:56,210
assume weatherbeater packet is in motion

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,240
and it has not received to the secondary

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,789
here during that episode where is it

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,210
what did we get so for example in this

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:07,789
case I am going for data on some movie

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,850
where the wedding was born I am changing

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:12,680
it to find out so it is in progress and

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,699
at this point of time it has not really

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,550
yet so unique that time is someone where

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,310
is it what did we get

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,639
so here what we are saying it's an even

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,569
consistency so it will be consistent but

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,590
even she be now not exactly what we are

00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:35,770
wearing so we have an O sub consistence

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:39,310
intervals over Y so it is enforced on

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:44,500
green so for example if the menu has

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:47,229
been updated on B and from surfing it

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,080
will be the query we've made it has

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,539
executed it executes on a and this is

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,270
this can be said of application

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,580
consistency is it goes to before so when

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,020
we said before here at for consistency

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,599
on ring similarly as you know I am

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:08,590
writing something concern would be and I

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:10,659
bought that I should not give the give

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:14,469
the header to the blind bag until unless

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:16,990
I execute it and all the members so for

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:20,680
example here in me when I am executing

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,160
some DML until unless it is only one

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,460
remember me

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,100
okay so when it gets back to the flight

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,970
now that we are querying and I will get

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:36,610
when you find it across the road and we

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:40,030
also have before and after consistency

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:46,180
level now moving over there is composite

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:50,289
annual so as you see something one

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,740
member be and we during that time this

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,620
map goes away and because if some plant

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,099
tries to worry

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,870
[Music]

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:01,090
he should not leave the stage later

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,919
so in this case but I say it the

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,490
consistency level is he personal before

00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,160
on primary fit over the where even hold

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,620
until domestic execute it on game so

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:17,380
when when it executes sit in the

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:19,570
wingless fight now in the operations but

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,910
what used to happen attainment

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,050
replication is the member which was the

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,050
part of this dope

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,000
we don't even the movement we used to

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,190
race to stop the replication that member

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,930
because alright so when it was not a

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,940
part of the group we were able to move

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,710
means and rights over there so which was

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,810
not good because they tries to join

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,600
there that might help has some extra

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:46,060
idea which is now which which is not

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,520
supported in the room so now when we say

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,100
stop program deviation the member will

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,350
remain read-only so only weeks will

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,900
happen there won't be any red so after

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,440
we give do some changes to it to rectify

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,810
it

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:05,560
it can joining back to the throne now

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,970
one step further so assume Network

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,790
partitioning happens so that working

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,580
network is quite unreliable so suppose

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,670
there's there's a backup legend due to

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,330
which he gets separated form from this

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,310
book and it is unreachable to that so

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,220
during that point of time now we have

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,590
two mechanism one I can say that this

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,720
member should become read only and only

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,280
we must read operation without these are

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,969
all of this can no right should happen

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,919
so for that I can say read only which is

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:41,410
default as a exhibit interaction and if

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,490
I want it to be more secure then what I

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,700
can say

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,440
as possible so that number will grow but

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,360
will shut off automatically so then

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:58,070
there won't be any lead encouraged on

00:08:50,360 --> 00:09:01,700
the router I can also increase the

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,450
priety for a particular member so that

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,860
when any member it goes to the other

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,840
member gets picked up which I have

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,540
selected for example in this piece I

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,890
have three members memory never we never

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,780
see member B is the primary number a and

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,600
C is having a different rating based on

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,240
this one I have decided that if suppose

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,860
number B goes down then automatically

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,040
see should become a primary so

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,350
eventually when this member was out of

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,450
the group then C will be elected as a

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,450
primary for that I can use this

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,400
and accepted values accordingly by

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,400
default it is set to compete

00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,679
this is one of the most important

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,499
feature that has volunteers you know 30

00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:55,129
which gives us the power of selecting

00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:58,160
her primaries on whether peppers are

00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,470
wanting so in this there is a single

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,040
primary mode where we is the primary and

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,910
this part of time and operations I want

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,399
that

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,759
let's give me the NetSuite a as a

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,249
primary so if I said we're using this

00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:16,519
you have a particular member ID so I

00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:18,230
think of somebody new ID of someone P

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,149
over here and once it is done

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,889
automatically they will become the

00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:26,239
primary and there is a note over here

00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:28,519
then this can be all for any member and

00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:33,919
it will be the action will be taken or

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:37,399
in the group similarly similarly if I am

00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:40,999
on single private mode and as a DBA I

00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,709
think that okay know the demo is not not

00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:47,779
what I want I want multi-prime you know

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:51,079
then automatically all the purse will

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:53,660
become Friedrich they will have separate

00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:57,819
operations so this is a single

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:01,419
particular problem switching similarly

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:05,319
from multi primary mode because special

00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:08,239
single Avenue and based on the mexican

00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:10,130
lexicographic order of a server here I

00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:12,709
guess

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,850
we've collected if I don't pass this

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:16,009
number new ID

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,930
you're suppose I have this ABC and I

00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,670
want that okay we should we go to

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,410
Prairie then I should pass

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,709
there's are you weary of it they don't

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,350
have to keep effectiveness new memory so

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:30,410
we can switch from 24 every go sailor

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:34,600
frankly and it's everything is alright

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,600
we do not have to take it off

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,360
so

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,179
[Music]

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,980
I want the stasi and one beta which

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,170
shall be shifted by seven okay and then

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,570
it has propagated to somebody and

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,390
they're from source so he does oversee

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:22,410
so I can find the information they're

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:26,980
from and what time dinner was originated

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:29,470
again what time it was originated on you

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,080
hate mustard which is B and if I won't

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,880
be I might get the information I am I

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,510
will get the information of when it was

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,030
generated on see our from this I will

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,790
also get information then when equals

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:45,340
received what transaction have executing

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,490
at what time I have received it and then

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,200
if there are any transient errors and

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,770
get that information are wrong with the

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:57,340
ten stem so I have more information how

00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:59,080
data and what data and what time it is

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,830
traveling and how much time we are

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,800
taking to execute it and there is a

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:11,470
final tour for receive all a worker

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,730
community worker threads so we get all

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:19,420
this information

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:22,210
customers in group application ABC are

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,300
having a business enterprise remove

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,340
formatting practical the rules of them

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,890
appear primary but can be a secondary

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,780
and they might they can serve different

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,200
portions so now I have the strength

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,000
status of this concrete drove everything

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,670
function and who is friendly so if this

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,060
is Grace and we need to see a secondary

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,980
scene and these with fibers a purposeful

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,050
version where is

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:58,280
oceans so I have this information and it

00:14:48,050 --> 00:15:02,840
is consistent from the security

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:05,210
perspective what used to happen it's

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,030
still it is the thing is if I'm writing

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:11,090
something on server to get your since we

00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:14,860
are using logical application it's not

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:18,830
fine suppose if there is a person who

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,670
gets another access to this question he

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,340
might be able to make some information

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:28,430
you also that thing we have a ribbon

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,720
encryption so there's an encryption or

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,710
binary dope

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm talking mechanism so if I'm reading

00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:40,970
something on the server that will be

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,920
encrypted encrypted and the same

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,940
information and goes to the secondly

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:51,890
this reader docks with me until you so

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:54,890
this is to tire of secretive protocol

00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:57,710
there whatever the data is there

00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:00,200
in the file that is protected by default

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,790
password and this file password is a

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,360
gate

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:08,080
when binding-off encryption key so this

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,140
is to tire of encryption our disk and

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,420
that helps us from any unauthorized

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:19,480
access and people will not be able to

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,950
get that extract that information and

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,070
they have any more features that has

00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,200
gone into my simulator and it's if I

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,450
start off over everything it would be a

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,370
very lengthy sessions so what what I

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,440
would rate is maybe we came to discuss

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,890
of these things in bicycle would so I'm

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,390
just touching upon one of them over here

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:42,160
like how we have enabled we have changed

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,470
the default option so that I do

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:56,290
neighborhood application gets to you

00:16:44,470 --> 00:17:00,910
24 so why am i copying is a value and

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:06,040
then from there that gets everyone

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:09,620
before 24 Beta Beta is historic even

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,890
it has become fresh sleep even after the

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,120
crash did data is persisted

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,360
inter-metallic less persistent Aveeno

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,699
daily pivot tables away from that

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,290
replication the right based applied

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:25,760
mechanism is using hash askance now

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,709
website extraction is hot by default

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,280
which is which group application

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:34,310
requests by log expiration is set to 30

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,250
days and somewhere any surplus of unique

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:41,450
medical sector when you want and it can

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,700
be changed as we has really is set up so

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,380
all these particular values has dg4

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,400
difference for that we get a waiver

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,500
application whenever talking about on

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,560
the enhancements burn for the monetary

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,950
purpose threads conditional variables

00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:02,360
mutex this has been instrumental and all

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,580
this performance a schema so it has it

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,310
is in monitoring aspect

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,870
apart from that on operation cents say

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,000
fire support has been added from the

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,660
population in the right sector

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,090
extractions for states are supported in

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,150
the proper application quite waste and

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:23,390
there's a there are few variables which

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,130
has been added to control the flow there

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,520
is pro control kinetic variables and

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,730
when that we can throttling and we can

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,730
put some

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,480
for pro controller protections in the

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:43,029
bill about that ipv6 are going as we

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,249
have done and for the performance point

00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,529
of view the corpus has been improved

00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:51,039
between network leader and replication

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:53,350
layer apart from this there is a right

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,600
set transaction window transaction

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,139
dependency has gone into break so for

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:04,149
example when I show them if there are

00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:06,340
transactions which can be a good amount

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:09,399
of transactions which are not

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:14,590
conflicting those can be penalty effect

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:17,019
so people here database then we we have

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,590
this logical clock and now we have the

00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:22,059
right steps right check on it says is

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,159
using the transfer that rights and

00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,870
extraction if I have the hashes which

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,890
are not conflicting I get exhibit

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,570
the felony so this has improved of

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,970
imprudent performance a lot and apart

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,790
from that retail partial recent update

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:41,180
so partial recent update and draw text

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:44,860
these big data type and if I'm taking

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:49,310
only particulars part of data of it then

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,920
is for particular data it's very strong

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,320
to transfer the old data so with the

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,350
partial just an update I can only occur

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,630
we will transfer the chain data so it

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,600
will help in storage reduce the storage

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:09,350
as the nest performance so that's it on

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,690
this enhancements and a few more length

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,540
of this maybe we can talk talk about

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:19,030
merciful have it maybe have to explain

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:22,970
more on so talking about the roadmap so

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:29,510
these these are the times X times when

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:41,000
this has been don't and 21st 2013 AIDS

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:45,650
in protein has been just download it and

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,590
just cried out and good so this is

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,350
something

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,059
so think about the replication service

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,399
and the replication and the replication

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,009
people have them they have different use

00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,860
cases they can have simple pasture and

00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:03,190
stabilization they can have video

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,259
replication we have a VC will be

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,620
transferring data to each other and we

00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:11,320
can also have multiple masters sending

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,769
data Bruce Lee are you one we can have a

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,009
master which will be having multiple

00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:20,799
slaves but the rain is available so you

00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:22,210
can think of any topology and even you

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,509
can mix and match all those things with

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,539
our program negation so just make sure

00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:38,679
my colleague but I will be talking about

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:42,490
process postman session in here in this

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:46,480
picture the junipers with the high only

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:51,090
bleeding and for the green scalability

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,090
this infamous or services

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,660
and my super shell this can be used for

00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:00,560
provisioning management and the role of

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:03,290
any particular so in this cluster and my

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,390
super router helps in redirecting the

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,830
reads and writes to a particular server

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:11,980
where we want so there can be one

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:16,070
practical side or can be extended to any

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,170
further replica set so this is a

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,220
complete picture for high near 80

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:24,880
disaster recovery so just let me go

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,880
right

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:35,190
so from here we can for the package to

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:37,049
download we can go to this link and for

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,530
the documentation my simple

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:42,630
interpretation has been many

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,970
improvements and roughly replication

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,799
related members are looking to

00:22:43,970 --> 00:23:00,809
consistently you can always go and do it

00:22:46,799 --> 00:23:03,950
from here and if you want to thank you

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:03,950
