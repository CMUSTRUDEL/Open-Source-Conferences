I

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:13,599
number six years ago school today we'll

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,849
discuss about any bit clusters and its

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,460
features and how to set up their

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:22,110
clusters

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,110
this is respect

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,930
let's discuss participation with magical

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,269
clusters magical cluster is a

00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,230
combination of Mexican suburbs and the

00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:52,300
administrative data can be stored in

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:55,330
both in memory in this culture it was

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,850
initially been designed for technical

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:02,670
purposes where high availability and

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,670
high performance is key

00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,139
[Music]

00:01:11,500 --> 00:02:00,680
this is so magical applause there is six

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,060
nights that means less than 40 seconds

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,420
down time in Asia so this has been

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,739
verified by the customers it is said

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:16,820
nothing's notify said I mean across all

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,709
the notes that I stare stored with each

00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,830
floor store data

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:23,780
it's not and the no single part of it

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,230
was it kind of substance multiple

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,230
networks

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:26,650
you know as I said Menshikov also

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,360
millions of Korean you can throw to read

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,760
and write at the same time through the

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:36,250
Costas since the data will be stored in

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:41,940
disk in community harder you can store

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,940
data that is

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,670
and especially with Mexican clusters as

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,610
I said it can support that if that's

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,670
data resides within memory you can store

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:59,590
many terabytes of data while in this

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:01,900
event store many atomic self-other it

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,900
said party resource pocket a data center

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,580
200 magical service enemies known for

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,190
high performance within our own

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,940
benchmarking clues we found that it

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:20,709
supports a 200 million reads per second

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:24,160
and 1 billion of this in these are the

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,820
industry currently magical place mainly

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,820
telecoms

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,730
many high volumes tourists of course

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:44,459
also they are taking in our customers

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:48,809
mainly yeah you can see like Telecom

00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,809
there's a web applications

00:04:52,910 --> 00:05:11,120
so just quickly look at here you can see

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:14,690
that and the basically the application

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,380
is from the management server is it

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,780
mainly responsible for handling raw

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,290
steroid configurations whether it's a

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:28,400
complete between North Africa to decide

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:30,890
who is the president also supports

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:39,700
talking much to avoid locking mechanisms

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:39,700
and then is a client management

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:49,370
in the back and you can pop ups your

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:51,979
initiative test like you have stock of

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,030
recovery all this we said it does you

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:57,139
can pass through that you can perform

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,960
management server is responsible for

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:06,199
that and you can give those comments

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:09,169
you're okay with that then you can see

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:13,159
ever for anybody anybody 1 2 3 4 this is

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:15,139
a for example circle India and they are

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,889
the heart and soul of papers to clusters

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:24,650
where these actually stores after that

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:27,139
is a nice nose and rocking also and this

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:31,490
is also for comes conditional look up

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,900
like throw primary key you know when you

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,199
perform a body they're basically

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:41,830
required us to hear and besides aware my

00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,830
dad has rows and rows and all these

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,360
then you can see that a spell no later

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,300
than 3 a spell - credit notes middle

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,430
this is for us you can have many more so

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,950
the main purpose unit from hence

00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:03,690
Christopher is to MySQL what is likely

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,000
to be a positive answer any any SQL

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,550
queries these these are the layers the

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,710
responsible for that then the last layer

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,270
is called a client and equate yes you

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,820
can see here that there are so many

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:20,150
black times out there and ap also their

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,280
actual query is submitted in this nail

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:28,640
with a cluster and this layer is

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,640
responsible for valency distributions

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:35,040
that is NV b fa this is the AP program

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,610
it's a native API a program of the

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,540
crossness and which is written in c++

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:46,890
and this is the only a paper route which

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:50,580
can penetrate through the anybody no

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,800
other girl can talk directly to the

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,560
and you a will see this connection

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,110
second senior this is your plants and

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,240
these are your a Payless you can see

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,480
that either it is a fine super sharper

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,740
or any of the like mustard say and DVP

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,810
and this is the any behavior where the

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,810
request park pass we'll start with the

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,660
crimes to pass the municipal server then

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,280
we pass to the individually these Devin

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,800
Townsend's that request to the Tejanos

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,020
and it passed the data and then it comes

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,380
back to the candy wait wait come back to

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,810
the SQL or a hippie then finally to

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:32,430
adjust with the lines so this is the

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:35,930
flow the difference between FBI and my

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,790
abilities are nodes is that since since

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:41,010
anyway page they directly talk to the

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,050
Antipodes of give you whether if you

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,460
perform any for you through API then

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,980
your purpose

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,320
better than people pass through the main

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,520
screen difficult when you pass the

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,070
police tada - Bertie

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,110
mr. Tucker sent me to the NDB API in

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,210
tibia method finally and if you go to

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,600
the pattern also have you cut cut one

00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:08,480
layer of omnipotence that's why we say

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:11,490
that when you go from noisy service

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,670
let's look at the view of the fixers

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,190
duster pizzas here it's of course a

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,850
subcompact like any idea with a p-wave

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,850
ems

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,610
[Music]

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:40,430
after study after study specifically it

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,430
is inbuilt as I said you don't have to

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:52,620
switch back then nothing bothers cluster

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,330
so when you create suppose you have for

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,640
that and also you can see a one two

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,680
three four better than your number of

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,460
data nodes your distance is created

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,130
automatically

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,320
the moment you create a table 2 u 1 so I

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,120
get a partition in the

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,970
obviously people so it's back to some

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,200
store the store you sit after you do one

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,090
of the data roses like say this one

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,700
partisan P one story started in the

00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,890
pattern or 1 F 1 is the primary pregnant

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,450
while the same that I did applicant that

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,610
again if the doctor not to that is

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,680
called a secondary fragment the same way

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,300
you can see that all this but all these

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,430
practice and data are stored in the

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,320
primary one is for primary and another

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,470
is go through the second thing so the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,380
idea is behind is that if you're not one

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,410
is down that means this data to have

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,600
both the data they contain the same

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:47,500
thing is here so that's how you say that

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,190
it is it handles point of I mean knows

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,820
you feel part of ghettos so this data

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,140
rotate if you have more notes and

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:04,990
workbooks and packaged up on that you

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:08,470
are not educated by rock calculation it

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,850
is basically how many data nodes you

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,980
have replicates basically how many

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:21,660
replicas or product I want to store we

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,660
currently support or for that

00:11:44,470 --> 00:12:09,470
you can you can build right in your

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,450
operation surprise this officer or well

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,060
these holes are adding one by one to the

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,520
a teaspoon mustard matter you to

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:21,170
distribution normalization everything

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,660
happens in the background maybe little

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,820
bit slow with you do a period but we

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,390
don't have to succumb the cluster of

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,580
like all the battles and my collect all

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,560
the data you don't have to do their

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:40,899
fathers that is then partition also you

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:45,009
can do artisans table thank you we saw

00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:46,899
the reverse lives online start/stop is

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:48,550
that North even starting note stop

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,369
entrance and the respective North winter

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,139
weather prospects are already upgraded

00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:57,899
whether it's a waste of grapes our

00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,899
cluster of pressure you can do that with

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:05,009
clusters it can happen that suppose you

00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:08,860
had in seven or four clusters and

00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:12,519
galaxies cluster you can do that about

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,800
the rocks and Senate report and half of

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:27,699
them must have been seven taxis within

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:29,470
this you can unlink backup and mystery

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,420
yes repair you can take a backup of the

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,480
clusters and additional by the cluster

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,819
is often trendy when I am saying you can

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,279
do all the proper transition through the

00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:42,249
clusters it's not that okay perceive

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,839
objects is going to that's how minimize

00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,540
your rank of restaurants at the radio

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,929
presence you don't have to do that any

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,080
configuration basically thank at a

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,720
church or when you move from one

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,440
you might change a few of the computers

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,180
and parameters so you can add those

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,670
config parameters to the existing

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,000
computer which is the computer cell

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:08,510
files and you can do a reading list and

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,920
could you take care of everything and

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,070
find out everything happens you believe

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,070
that

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,620
so when to consider magical cluster

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,050
mainly I mean customers are talking

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,320
mainly these three points it scalability

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,540
that can see Undertown scalability

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,540
scalability as I said that or when your

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,790
business is great but then you should

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,649
think about that whenever any response

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,560
you have you are looking for a high

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:40,079
response real time or counting as I said

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,630
that is a 6/9 that means 30 second down

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,890
time in a year if these are the critical

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,900
parameter for you business then probably

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:53,050
whispers then let us set up a simple

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,910
Astor's I am purchasing here a corner

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,010
clustered up this one man one man it

00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,400
window for a turn or two one - speeding

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:03,070
servers for illustrative purposes I have

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,480
just shown here that all not one would

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:09,430
be both for all the developers because

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,650
there is no point in running a plus

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,970
plane and single worst of everything in

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:21,300
the same post and this is the management

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,300
client actually is a management

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,279
- apparently I'm in suder's

00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:32,029
pretty promising you know all these

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,029
hosts you can get from the

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,780
my students recipe another is

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,970
reconfigured I think which is the

00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,490
clutter specific my nuts end up in

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,160
standard mental mind at CNM finally very

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:11,300
basically you ever mentioned IP address

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:14,480
of the management or sanity in computing

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:25,730
here you can mention what is my

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:27,590
management or its IP address and so

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,500
these computers and pets you can get it

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:33,650
from this online you can get these

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,720
computers and the change operating as

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,970
per your requirement next step is to

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,270
install the - 20 surface you can see

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,700
that - reducibility they see the comment

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,310
is customizable to suffer from the mice

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,770
particulate and using this comma and you

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:52,670
can see that yes - producer policy is

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,860
but then the step is to start the

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,420
cluster so that the sequence particular

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,420
sequence if you remember that

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,770
we'll start first then all the data

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,939
servers so the management not said you

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,949
can start the management notes from the

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:19,400
management client you can issue this

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:22,900
comment now here you can see the bench

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,900
for the cluster management service

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,910
new persons they started then check the

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,590
status of the management drop basically

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,780
from the management where this is the

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:36,130
management client in do understand the

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:41,850
MTA this is the process and from here so

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,850
is the command which will show you now

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,820
let's tap all the data no see this is

00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,880
the comment list and start a tab

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,769
controls and from that one two three

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,559
four you can see that I am using these

00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:06,260
comments and you can see that other

00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,570
started let's take the status of the

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:17,000
darkness here you can see that it is now

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:19,940
started from the management plan that is

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,059
the IDS both started for is the ID or

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,899
node ID of the car like five and six and

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:28,929
seven so you just start all this from

00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,929
the

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,960
this is the

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:18,660
these are the full acquaintances waiting

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,920
for the connection to span let's do some

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,720
transition on it

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:31,380
and to do that under start the bicycle

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:33,630
client here to decline this one and it

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,150
at a public setting thereafter under two

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:40,170
samurai inserts of growths I have been

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:43,340
shattered six seven plus then select of

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,340
medicine to see how do they

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,120
so at this point we are clusters of a

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,110
hundred if we give some grantees are not

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,690
so let's look at the one of the key

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,150
features the self killing of clusters

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,890
the idea of self filling is that if

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,640
anybody's crushed it will start

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,640
automatically

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:21,110
and how to start it so let's do abs -

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:23,390
yep and anybody process ok never done do

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,140
a kill - 9 this is the process idea of

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:30,770
this DVD so let's see power to happen

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,230
now you can see that not great and

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,330
restarting our schedule basically we

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,240
have killed it is no I need for this one

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,030
they are killed and now see you can see

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,330
that it's not connected accepting and

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,980
all the three are still running after

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:51,010
sometimes you can see that it is

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:55,340
stacking automatically about that then

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,590
so if you check the status of the status

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:05,710
of the

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:08,200
the former suspected that means so the

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,850
another feature is conduct no single

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,100
point of failure that means you can

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:16,990
cross multiple notes at the same times

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:20,320
and is not about nothing

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,130
let's kill one of the animals you can

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,130
see that one

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,430
[Music]

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,330
yeah here one point is that you cannot

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:38,340
grasp both the notes from the same group

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,990
that means after historically store down

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,789
that means there is no way you can

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,789
recover on this URL

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,770
so that's what you said when you say

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,020
that I approve replicates character to

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,670
that we spook appear there if you say I

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,980
have the replica is kind of three that

00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:00,340
means in this node group zero there will

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:04,059
be no 94 type and the six or goes to

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:09,220
zero then six seven eight

00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:11,530
I can kill four and five and six and the

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:18,010
seventh from the group's clustering

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:19,750
skills of so this is this is this is a

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:26,220
typical scenario where half of the

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:26,220
cluster is down and up of the process so

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,849
[Music]

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,169
let's go to go back with the same table

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,700
so that means when prostitution area in

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,700
half clusters douse with Anderson Cooper

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:06,040
but we can't do an epic hospital now so

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,130
my simple tennis leave the crustal

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,970
distances this is the link where you can

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:16,080
download the first refineries manuals

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,080
computers and everything

00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,490
people ready

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,500
it's either goodness

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:26,500
pardon we support multiple work and

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,500
Prejudice but is not

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,110
No
