In this session, we will give a introduction of PolarDB, which is a  a cloud native database available on Alicloud. PolarDB separates the computing layer from a shared storage layer. This design allows the storage space to automatically scale according to usage. The computing layer adopts a a single master - multiple read only replica architecture, and scaling up a compute node or adding a replica only takes a few minutes.  The computing nodes and storage nodes  are connected with a high-speed network and use the RDMA protocol to execute data transmissions, resulting into I/O performance never being a bottleneck again.
