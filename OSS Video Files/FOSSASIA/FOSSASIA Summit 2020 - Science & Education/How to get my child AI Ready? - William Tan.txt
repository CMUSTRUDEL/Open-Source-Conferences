	00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,240
oh good morning everyone I'm very glad

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,859
that you don't if this could get like

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,790
the in situation before say show you

00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,950
still carry on

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,959
it is very compatible and the many

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,669
events they are canceled and it's quite

00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,440
a disappointment because we do look

00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:17,990
forward for Foss Asia that we get our

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,560
friends together to be down to exchange

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,750
of ideas and get things moving on so

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,240
today a flow touch on a topic may be

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,640
quite relevant to this time because

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,500
everybody have stay focused and do not

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,820
know what to do with your child so hope

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,610
you give my charlie

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,850
there's a topic that maybe were thinking

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,080
about some background by myself with a

00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,120
head of technology projects at the

00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,670
school of electronics infocomm

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,130
technology from Ikea Electress basically

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,230
I rather make a space called a space so

00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,620
our shower experience how we get our

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:55,550
kids are you interested in AI and get

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:58,340
them when go team so we this is no news

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,860
secret right is let's be around he says

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,200
my big famous party stir Andrew he's

00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,390
saying the AI is a new electricity and

00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,100
it is true the world is good to

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,979
transform even I believe we are

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,960
saturated with this profit 19 situation

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:14,329
there everything will be automated

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,789
everything will be with behind and how

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:20,450
do we therefore get on this generation

00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:22,549
reading so I will give you the four

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,850
steps which I think we apply in our

00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:29,569
makerspace four steps to get your child

00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,060
or your youth or your charge baby for AI

00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:34,159
well first thing is convince yourself

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,869
that you're AI is your child's future

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,460
you have to believe again they become

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,219
teens because there is a great

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,020
motivation if not you won't move on and

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,829
next thing is you have to lead by

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,369
example

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,530
and I will show you some examples and we

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,109
without reading reading example radial

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,150
motivation for the child for yourself

00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,120
and next thing is create

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,130
not on yourself but on the child you

00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,800
EDC's the ownership to learn you must

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,260
own it so that it was able to be a

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,650
continuing motivation performin the last

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,869
part but not least coding is boring we

00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,850
have to make it fun and ingenious make

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,220
things what we think the worst of all

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,960
situation funding with that's why we can

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,330
have our overnight coding session and

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,030
examples so we have to make it fun so

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,790
let me go through one by one first is

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,550
convince yourself if you're not

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,730
convinced please go get Time magazine

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,100
Newsweek MIT magazine or you look at

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,140
workable forum which I think this very

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,430
recently they've just posted on 16th of

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,100
January - OH - OH

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,600
which I can share with you here here's

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,850
what you need to know about through job

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,540
work well you shot is going to be

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,720
automated

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,790
you can be a machine driven and there is

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,360
coming up soon if you are not convinced

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:54,100
you can watch this YouTube video

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,100
Joshua what are the experts is

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,120
response police say oh don't worry

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
nothing would happen to Josh

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
chops

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:25,730
- adventurous of when you're 20 it's

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,730
difficult but we do it again

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,190
what we have to do then it's easy to

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,280
imagine the predicted 66 million people

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,480
poised to lose their jobs to machines

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,000
motoring the single friend

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,770
the OECD it

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,340
organization

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,490
and estimates that 14% of jobs could be

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,500
automated in industrialized countries

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,420
and though machines always do easily

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,980
coming off to manufacturing and that

00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,230
work

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,780
cause even though requiring more

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,810
specialized skills

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,819
Automation open sexes chief financial

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,069
officer reported that there

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,510
US equities trading this important

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:14,879
Kandra traders back in 2000

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,389
two of those positions have become

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,570
motionless by 2017 so are you convinced

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,389
I hope you are so knowing all this

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,669
there's a responsibility for us to make

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:31,020
our generation next generation free dai

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:33,419
reading so how Koba and of course it's a

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,889
that always too hard he is hard core

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,290
Python is hard coding his heart

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,560
everything is hard but this is evidence

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,380
that it can be done all my students here

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,120
are not very academically inclined but

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,270
they are finished is a eye for youth

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,460
program money home and he went to it and

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,289
they get a set of accomplishment from in

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,180
town after certifying there would be our

00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,639
projects and and a whole journey they

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,800
have a comma a social impact bi pooja on

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
the bone and he's a very great process

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,190
in fact this group went through hard

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,500
time because they only have a short

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,150
timeframe to push themselves while we

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,400
have one over you to do that for the

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,199
other batches so to convince you and is

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,410
it a close partnership that we do with

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:17,449
Intel so let me show you with you what

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,449
we don't share our us

00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:29,259
so he's a Intel McNish API for you with

00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,719
ite

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:40,459
and we hope to build and enable a I am

00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:43,849
the future going back to here so it can

00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,589
be done so we must be convinced that we

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,569
must raise the next generation and it

00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:50,269
can be done so vast Knicks lead by

00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,399
example so I will share with you that

00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:54,169
how do we go by by learning you can come

00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,360
to life own Institute technical courses

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,879
Napoli for sure or you can come to IIT

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,099
we have short courses skew future series

00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,969
which you can go to our website you just

00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:07,999
look for and cause hard cause skin

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:11,119
future COC competency and existing Li

00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:13,519
Dao here they're ready causes on AI

00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:16,579
vinegar solution voice up in that game

00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,179
but you will have some chat bot our PA

00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:22,429
think studies are all state that them

00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:25,550
okay you can have a look and the cost

00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:28,279
fee is varies very surprisingly

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,289
affordable up the government subsidies

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,329
especially ssq future critic coming in

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,550
we are talking about range of $50 and

00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:37,789
pass class for today goes so make full

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,829
use of it to lead by example and if you

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:42,800
do not have motivation enough these are

00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:46,279
two seniors from RSVP basically they are

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,269
my trainees and they are fulfilled

00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,849
learning how to fly DJ hello drove some

00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:55,069
drone with AI be win and they lead by

00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:58,089
example and now your job is to train

00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:00,889
other seniors which is definitely our

00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:03,499
father's age of my youth age repeater

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:06,079
grandpa rage took her to do it if you

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:07,929
are not convinced well look at this

00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,219
linear auntie Judy

00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:13,219
yesterday she just messaged me over

00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,769
Facebook how do I solve this is her

00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:19,419
question what's wrong I've been checking

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:21,759
my code for so long I can't buy West

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,969
under in them does not

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,800
after intention level yet that is a very

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,599
challenging thing especially from

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,110
Facebook or mobile how do you go to

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,520
support that mistake well being one

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,409
footing being a teacher for so long

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,740
active students makes so much mistake

00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:43,150
that we I spotted it is here now these

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,770
desert additional space in from here and

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,189
there is at least not the problem and

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,189
this auntie Judy gasps aah

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,170
not yet but close she's in her seventies

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,000
and she start off with block programming

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,350
right now a challenge and because of

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
caffeine I think you can come to my

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,590
campus please learn Python on own and I

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,440
give them some catfish that same guy

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:16,660
that I gave to students so there is V by

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,400
sample yes no I mean block my copy

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,690
McClure of my cooking

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,580
there are seniors part of it that we

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,580
started with block programming I scratch

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,480
I can go to the other community center

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,840
or they come to me

00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,090
so they both free so that's what what so

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,220
why is this that we need to create a

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,320
ownership to learn and this is how we do

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,390
it with the Intel AI for new program

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,600
there are four phase inspire acquire

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,040
experience and power inspire to really

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,650
connect into excite that that is pretty

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,380
easy you just recently I products my

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,660
games and they will be it's like that

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,880
then we will teach them other skills

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,390
which is not obvious can sees microbial

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,090
programming before move on to Titan and

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,220
of course we bring in laser cutter 3d

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,350
printing because AI project is not a

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,430
stand-alone software project encompasses

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,460
with the hard way

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,470
fixing up the prototype and yeah things

00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,450
that you need to ping so we need a good

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,910
that we can skew after there they go

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,740
through boot camp and during the boot

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,290
camp in their experience base which is

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,420
usually one week or two weeks which is

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,100
going to happen soon in two weeks time

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,040
they must first come back they will

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,080
learn about AI jobs and also AI car a

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,810
simple one there is a self-driving car

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,030
they tried using open CV to track the

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,470
back line and you and using the camera

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,420
to differentiate the different traffic

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,260
sign and make the decision to the left

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,540
and right move forward or to stop after

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,200
that they are able to two projects with

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,940
the Koreans and also hopefully we can

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,610
move some of the partners in un United

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,160
States we would like to travel there

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,530
because of coffee 19 what we're going to

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,950
do is likely teleconference was where

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,780
the big use of sky we have big use of

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,370
Microsoft teams just to don't get the

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,200
project started and when the coffee I

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,260
think situation is better we will try to

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,260
file one so the ownership is that the

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,700
student need to get them cell ready so

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,890
then they can work with the oversee

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,230
friends and there is a bit of peer

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,790
pressure there because our oversee

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,950
friends expect our students to be

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,710
somewhat competent and they them self

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,030
excited nervous easily be competent so

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:31,000
they are actually motivated by

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:34,060
incompetent so finally after doing all

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,010
these boot camp experience they are

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,620
supposed to a a I project which is

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,410
creating social impact so things like

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,930
recycle with a I use if you sign a I

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,330
technology to do recycling can you use

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,460
it to dispense pencil to their seniors

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,690
in a more efficient way so these are the

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,130
previous projects that my student

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,830
actually came up and get their

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,760
certification from Intel this is NASA

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,920
and they feel very proud of it and if

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,570
engineers from rosacea where my

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,180
companies with a process you would like

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,880
to endorse students of their competency

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:11,740
I think that would be a great things to

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,750
do so create energy to none and let me

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,400
give you example that what we do in the

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,520
oversea this is actually a YouTube video

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,710
done by EBS at acacia Broadcasting

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,770
System of Co South Korea and they

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,560
recently imposed this AI program on

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,870
YouTube and you can and you can get a

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,850
glimpse of what my students and their at

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,100
the curry students do together over two

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,020
days doing AI screw jacks together and

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,210
there's a lot of struggles they a lot of

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:43,030
pain but actually it's a good time to go

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:45,660
together so let me move to that yeah

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,660
and joy

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:58,110
the shock we had aminos effective I

00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,110
believe we watch to a lot of a drama

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,679
[Music]

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,529
imagine the excitement

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,970
and you cut this grass

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,110
[Music]

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:39,450
those are words for you that's my

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,450
guillotine brother

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,000
[Music]

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,059
[Music]

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,580
he's on a hike on the Caribbean

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,529
so it may ask me then any language

00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:24,149
barrier answer is no such as cocklebur

00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,629
translator of course the other way is

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:31,410
bigger language which is coding

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:34,589
recording you can connect it though they

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:45,359
can show their translation program but

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:47,009
because of the software we are doing you

00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,889
can see how we have done what they are

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:53,479
not the one to go for much because they

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,479
are so excited with hope a dream

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,100
so he can catch his video they tower

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,850
tell you where you can get the other

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,980
ladies

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,110
he started way from a law from the

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,820
University in the state in Europe and

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:22,910
follow it all the way back to Singapore

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:25,940
and all the way back to go here so the

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,570
answer is drawn yes you can no two days

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,550
or three days is okay to film because we

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,980
have the gist in in in the future and

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,260
that game were future failure is part of

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,580
Education and because of failure they

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,320
learn further so inertia arcane last

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,690
part but not least make it fun how to

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,840
teach Titan I'm very glad that Faust

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,030
Asia and of hiking Python hiking session

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,940
and that is one of the way to get

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:57,760
students fun just I mention about auntie

00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:00,980
Judy well she is learning this book now

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,720
and I'm very glad for this author I

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:08,780
really appreciate him very much because

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,610
he make it free hobo is online and he's

00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,700
known either only poop that Hitler of

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,340
mine you can either buy the book from

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,440
Episode III wushu hope everybody that

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:22,460
can afford to get it but he put the

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:27,080
whole chapter here and guess where is

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,770
auntie Judy which chapter wanna make a

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,500
guess

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:35,290
seven is to show okay I give you a clue

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,970
let's go back to my slides let me try to

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:44,500
go back and see where Addie Judy was

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:49,330
hardly to gain chapter chapter 11

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:53,730
okay bagels Titan auntie Judy then I

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:58,600
will show my student very soon okay

00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:00,660
she's a housewife she's not an engineer

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,790
their favorite trade in fortune and

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,380
that's the passion she took no an inner

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,860
self she got a group of seniors in

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,720
common too wrong image into not together

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,720
so now wait they're learning for these

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,400
games don't just make it like okay

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,920
there's a tic-tac-toe game and you just

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,140
run the code and you understand code and

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,570
make it work no that's not the objective

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,980
we should challenge our students or your

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,279
child in such a way now you have a

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,860
tic-tac-toe is working

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,990
computer versus player you just plain to

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,690
can you make the game in such a way is

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,950
computer versus container mega fat for

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,160
example this is computer possess

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:42,570
computer is a video of him he's running

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,980
hundred browse computer versus computer

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:48,760
actually you are discover certain things

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:52,959
of the algorithm is bias who several

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,580
starters usually reduce okay yeah I know

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,930
if there's a certain bias that you can

00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,820
see computer we how many time compare me

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:04,150
for this X tiny I player bring to any

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,579
one time 533 Y is biased and it's a

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,339
question you can prompt if the shower or

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,959
the youth able to do it think of it and

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,400
the end of the book you will learn this

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:18,390
game I think it is a very interesting

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,390
game is something to avoid obstacle

00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:28,060
freestyle for our brothers it's a Dodger

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,060
game

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,140
no no this is of course is player moving

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,660
down use a simple pie came from this

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,900
book so make it fun and I think this

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,060
we've come in I think anybody can do it

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,030
but first thing lead by example parents

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,950
teachers go to this book first all right

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,740
actually when you go to up to chapter 11

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,960
you are somewhat having the kinda basics

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,030
we let me check the pie make sure we are

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,660
right so make it fun what are the things

00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,660
we can make it fun

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,350
well this is donkey car if you are know

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,450
are aware of donkey cart donkey car is a

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,640
very big RC car they put a raspberry pie

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,430
on top and you actually drive in many

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,900
rounds around the circuit then he after

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,970
that you go through the Cara's training

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,880
my training and you were self driving

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,700
this is an open source project is

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,100
available on the web and you can buy the

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,990
whole entire car from Hong Kong it's

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,130
called I think it's called robocar store

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:30,350
right so here what we did is we the car

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,690
is somewhat a bit expensive for every

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,090
student in my school to use it so what

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,020
we do is report it over and you notice

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,320
there the video

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:42,140
it is a reco bit we have for the handful

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,360
is basically our IP camera and we treat

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,480
it print everything and we use the same

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,130
avoid make it run so after the viewer

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,380
these are micro pin donkey car we

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,560
purposely let it off and see whether you

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,100
already able to come back the boobies

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,100
out of us

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,840
Claude Larry surprisingly able to be

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,840
done pretty well

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,000
shop corner no issue we come to genders

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,420
like there's some issue by able to come

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,100
and cuddle we were very surprised we

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,290
only drive this car around the track for

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,770
around 10 rounds or so before they stop

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,770
for training

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,130
no we don't use the hem on the memories

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,770
I have photo project an image a video

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,720
image vector this is a PC interface from

00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,700
talk Iike you're actually your projector

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,340
you can have an image on the screen and

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,530
remote control coming from the PC but

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,910
there is to drive the power around many

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,140
times before you go for the Charis

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,150
training so you can check it out it's

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,640
called Anki car.com all right it's a

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,960
very interesting project and how we want

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,300
to make it more fun we could appeal a

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,880
city for this car

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,040
if the still of fast and furious then we

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,410
go for fast fingers right that's

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,630
something to make it funny

00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,970
of course next day students love drones

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,580
and this is our some jokes performance

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,410
three five drops using TJ I tell all edu

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,180
and it's a very affordable drone please

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,820
when you purchase it please purchase the

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,740
black Condor one with the edu because

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,780
the software typically is open for

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,640
everyone to use so I don't get the water

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,250
is white color my colleges for flying

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,680
for fun so what we have is we have 25 of

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,600
them and we flew it in a song formation

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,970
to get to the interest of programming

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,520
and the mixed age and we have another

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,400
version of this song trans is to fly to

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,530
loose recognizing signs to make it right

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,200
and do autonomous drone racing you can

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:35,610
see the interface book so enjoy this one

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,610
mini drone performance

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,290
sorry the music is a bit solved

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:53,220
you bringing the techno music student

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,220
will go crazy about it

00:20:53,790 --> 00:21:00,200
in fact you can teach math here I will

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,200
tell you where I wish pal you teach man

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,030
this is a perfect formation to teach

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:11,930
math the equation of a soccer league

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,650
Beverly we have to go to a sine and

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:17,990
cosine equation to complete that actual

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:21,730
distance and everything bloody inside at

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,730
all so there we can be spiral

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,520
so where's the a either a is actually

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:29,500
this our DJ I told has two cameras one

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,540
cameras pointing bottom one camera is

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,270
for the video capturing front the bottom

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,760
camera is to recognize the mission pet

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,280
below and a is using simple AI that they

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,640
are using and his father cheapest road

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,800
that is routine with intermode EVs fancy

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,590
- okay this very sunrise it one is 189

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,260
USD educators where further discount if

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,440
you apply for detail again I do not get

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,590
Commission of this this is that you just

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,950
as dedicated dedicated we are sharing of

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,770
course make it more fun let's get some

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,450
cube robots in this from you BJ what

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,510
we're going to this is actually and draw

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,050
people in the SDK is open you can build

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:17,260
your own app on this little cube robot

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,860
you can do synchronize dancing so my

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:24,970
dream is to make this form for robot to

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:27,130
become my BTS the robotic ETS people so

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:39,760
a Chinese show

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:42,340
[Music]

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,120
mr. Polito aurora borealis could be a

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,120
hater changer

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:52,640
[Music]

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:19,759
[Music]

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:29,060
okay this robot has you can walk it you

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,130
can actually it has a big in to go home

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,600
or you want to be used assuming you can

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,400
use this remove it and Jeannie is the

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,060
first c'mon you can talk to it by saying

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,130
hey Nene

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,730
why is today's day weather like in

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,320
Singapore and he has a I believe so this

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,540
is a very interesting robot to play with

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,860
and is not expensive and it's a

00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,570
available in or should be all countries

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,550
so make it fun and I hope that you find

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,730
it is fun enough for students to be

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:58,430
motivated to them so as I come to my

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,650
ending so for parts convince yourself

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,660
that may I is for your you for for your

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,280
child future I really believe it and

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,680
lead by example that you are willing to

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,560
get your hands dirty to then I turn to

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,480
learn all the necessary stuff and create

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,340
ownership so I am sure we feel how we

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,780
create ownership then the students will

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,820
be HIV will be getting a certificate

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,210
from Intel receptor they will be working

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,250
overseas friends on a hydrogen so they

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,740
have a motivation to them and they will

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,900
create an authorship and the last part

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,450
of knobbies coding can be very painful

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,850
especially I teach and I didn't share

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:36,950
with you 1 D 2 D actually troubleshoot

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:39,530
to Trini and I was shocked when she and

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,580
she still awakened and she's just want

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,220
to find a back

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:48,660
but we have a making fun right we've all

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,760
the robots and everything so I hope you

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,200
have enjoyed my session and this is

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,330
actually our Instagram account and also

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,100
our Facebook account in space W if you

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,550
have any question and all the videos the

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,910
links are all there right thank you any

00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,910
question

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,529
good question our our program is non

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,769
curriculum there's a say that it can be

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:19,600
very long Allah before pre boot camp the

00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:21,519
students of London I turn on a warning

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,100
easily 30 hours on the wartime and

00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,200
during the boot camp it can be two weeks

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,269
or one week this time we are trying five

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,370
days which is around forty hours and you

00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,919
can stretch through 80 hours for two

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,600
weeks so be excited after that the

00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,399
student do pooja on their own again is

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,200
based on the motivation we are

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,659
estimating issue project group takes

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,210
about six months to a social impact way

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,950
I approach I mean even so you see it

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,629
must be known it might be driven the

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,700
student might believe that this is

00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:50,769
important to them and this is world to

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,690
me that they were in fact in fast their

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:56,320
free time decide those students who play

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:58,029
watch movies anime a brain games but

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,190
they are investing the time or coding on

00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:03,500
stem and getting labs already these

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,060
ready have is a private option

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,060
100 students for life

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,940
yeah there's a very good question

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,370
so what we want to do is we're going to

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,320
impact all students hopefully we can get

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:22,160
over three years we can get 15 thousands

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,320
to this know get their AI inspired of

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,940
course as we go down the program you we

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,110
have blessing and that lets us to do

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,050
business something I'm very very

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:32,300
meaningful so we first batch Rica 20

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:36,440
plus it's time round for my book am I

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,210
have Roman people get interested Iran

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,740
became from March and June maybe in

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,960
September game I've had you over

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,390
students I know there is only one

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,920
college imagine we multiply into the

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,990
other two college will be more so we can

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,030
hope to get more and more as we are this

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:52,730
prepare continue so we are getting more

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:55,160
start on what then we will have many

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:59,410
more who cares many more training

00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,410
session that we can impact more students

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:09,510
yes standard attempts the court itself

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:15,010
- Natalie X number

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:17,380
like 80% of because I know computer

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,539
usually the proper really high I could

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,840
say we say that usually 10 to 20 percent

00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:24,730
only was very good yes usually we see

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,659
the reason why the reason why the

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,640
attraction to go oversea is and getting

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:34,059
the dog friends who have the same

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,080
passion Videha and some Java is because

00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:37,080
of certain other reasons

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,260
so it's not easy so we hope to get them

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,480
very interesting and they are and my

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,980
students are really are not Academy the

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,980
incline and they are very very

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,919
destructive people you know just

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:58,190
engineers we will have a music you play

00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,789
I mean cool they also have the enemy and

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,669
the movies

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:04,389
kdrama us and career discipline so they

00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:04,389
are very destructive to

00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,940
what's the word I don't use with backhoe

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:31,090
and though these distractions and all

00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:33,279
that but then you still want to guide

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,639
them and say a life is not just about

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,500
Netflix an enemy using its 45 or

00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:41,860
something else like

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,980
how as an indicator without wanting

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,500
their face back home

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,019
oh it's a very interesting question how

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,510
do you get students not distracted with

00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:53,250
kpop and he may drop us Netflix and

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,799
everything nice very simple you can

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,419
tweak them you join them

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,010
okay well now when I say joinha I

00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,750
personally watch anything okay I

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,880
personally watch them I don't watch I

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,580
fix my watch please I must know my spice

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,440
to the plane watching then after that is

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,870
necessary elements that we can from them

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,960
bringing it for example I know my

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:16,110
student enough for you let's go to South

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,149
Korea okay kpop kdrama so can we have

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,470
some friends in Korea Korea to work

00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:24,029
better with us and get them very

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:25,740
interested and from the enemy you know

00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:29,370
that they like fast and furious type of

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,019
stuff drawn let's bring joy okay is

00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,419
there can we bring a car days we're

00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,429
working fast I recommend these elements

00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,659
no we were with them that bringing if i

00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:38,010
before the in during a bigger space

00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,870
before we start this program we actually

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:43,559
do stuff like psycho

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:45,240
Star Wars our own however there is

00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,520
actually working of course not

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,530
attracting lightning but

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,500
so these are things to get any

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,750
interested we also bring in cosplay you

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,070
love cosmic cosplay the only requirement

00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,990
is they need to Treaty clean up their

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,960
own vodka

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,929
he must be functional and he must be

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,950
exactly as a replica of a virtual

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,500
cosplay over anything so we bring in

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,020
these are things to get them know with

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,670
the interest with the passion and

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,670
gathered so the the old

00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,210
knightly

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:27,690
you embrace what we are doing and from

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:31,290
there anybody yes that's the point

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,240
because in short we as educators and

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,340
parents all but we have to get involved

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,560
in the world it's slightly different but

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,710
we have get used to it and well pick up

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,060
the good things and bring them to learn

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,550
a skill that is useful for the future

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,940
and get them ready for AI in the future

00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,800
home answer that question is there a

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,540
need for an extra chair of the after

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,160
more session active throughout be happy

00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,160
to answer impression any more questions

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,670
oh this program for Italian for youth is

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,920
open for three colleges is open to

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,790
Audrey communism and soon we will open

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,750
up to learning the data table this is

00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,750
coming soon

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,090
for like

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,800
Oh currently both of them is from school

00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,350
engineering and scoring electronics

00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,870
infocomm of course we are seeing one way

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,340
they become open to score business

00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,530
Hospitality is it school of life science

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,420
are the tile students because they'll be

00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,880
very interesting because AI in these

00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,950
different views have different parents

00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,220
and in for application day is something

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,500
we hope that we can basically of to

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,860
impact the rest of the school so they

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,860
something

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,110
