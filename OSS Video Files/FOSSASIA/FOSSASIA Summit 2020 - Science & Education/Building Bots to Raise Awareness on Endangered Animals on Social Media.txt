Description: 
	Reddit is a social media which has an average of 1.6 billion users on an average monthly basis. About 56% of the Reddit users are young adults between the age of 18-29. I ran a survey of animals that were mentioned in various Reddit posts last month. Surprisingly, Alpacas are one the least talked about animals. This made me really inquisitive and on further research, I found out that there no wild alpacas left and about 98% of their population has already been wiped out. So I decided to raise awareness about Alpacas among Reddit users by making an Alpaca Bot. This bot is just basically a loop that checks all the latest comments, sees if someone has said 'alpaca' and then comments a random fact on it. Reddit allows programs to interact with their website by allowing those programs to access certain data through PRAW, where you can use python to access all the latest comments from all subreddits.
