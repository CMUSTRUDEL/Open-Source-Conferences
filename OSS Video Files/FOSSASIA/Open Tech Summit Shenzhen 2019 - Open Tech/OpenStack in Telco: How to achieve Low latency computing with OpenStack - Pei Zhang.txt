good morning everyone my name is item

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,450
senior written here from relax

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:16,650
welcome to anticipation I'm very happy

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,289
to share this talk I was 19 telecom how

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,750
to achieve lowland is in computing

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:28,070
without self this is police agenda I

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,399
will give our general introduction about

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,620
lowland in see the river from helium

00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:38,579
employee are written TDM leads outside

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,730
and last I will present our testing

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,010
windows in our testing environment so

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,820
let's go to the rest of us was slower

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,690
than missing I will start from some

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,579
examples the first one is the

00:00:50,690 --> 00:01:00,059
telecommunication currently sometime

00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:02,600
sometime come companies they are using

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,479
the network function virtualization

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,580
solutions so which which replace the

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,760
best heat of planets with the standard

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:17,790
hardware and software to implement they

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:23,270
are network functions so this means they

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:28,080
have the free performance quality for

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:30,990
infrastructure so if they are in high

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,570
London see they are voice the voice of

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,770
the competition may be aware of the

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,430
power of the phone company not imagine

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,190
that you are talking

00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,790
from special and journalist and

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:48,610
sometimes there's a high limb TV and

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,920
maybe your voices is to be later

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,750
interrupted that's less fat and that's

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:59,050
weird

00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:01,740
the next example is vehicle control

00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:06,190
especially the self-driving car

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,679
sometimes the serve Germany to transit

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:13,140
and me to mediator from the Assunta are

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:16,660
the navigation systems if there is a

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,390
silent easy if the plan is to turn right

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,800
turn left out surprised at a crossroad

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,900
but then hi learn a system then they may

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,110
need this operation and they may fail to

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:33,610
arouse the destination or even worse

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,420
they make us cry accident the silly the

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,590
voyeurism

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,980
stop treating even stock market the

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:47,410
price of each stock changes every second

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:51,220
so if there is hellenism it may the

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:54,519
treat may feel or the other update you

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,000
price make may mislead people and

00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,989
confuse people so they need emotions

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,790
that the Logan this is important as far

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,130
as now they are more industries which

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,780
may also means a lowland he say so

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:13,320
what's the lowland is the maximum

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,320
allowed

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,879
always within a certain violent let's

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,810
study let's show this chart and see this

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:27,950
chart so as I see stands for the time

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:31,310
the y-axis and for the response time the

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,330
horizontal regular stands for the land

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,160
is a bundle

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:43,730
so the this Klose response time of each

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:47,450
request so this means at any time the

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:52,629
response time should always be silly

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:55,790
Lennie's inbound let these are red odd

00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,640
this is not this is never allowed

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:02,810
because in each season the vanity bundle

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,440
so the luminous it means the maximum

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:09,910
response time must always within our

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,430
limitation must always less than the

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,549
limiting bounder so how to achieve

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:21,560
Illuminism we can use the route and

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:23,650
helium route ham is not about the speed

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,300
is not faster

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:30,130
it's about determination and is about

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,450
3tq

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:38,840
content behavior so in other word we

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,330
concede as a 10-man some obligations

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,729
they have determined namely second maybe

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,750
genius and an Omega microsecond for

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,360
summer vacation

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:56,530
there are many thousands of that runs in

00:04:50,360 --> 00:05:00,830
Weston in one second so this means this

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:03,020
the system master response within before

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:09,370
that one otherwise they would have bad

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:11,900
consequences helium helium is a Linux

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,640
virtualization technology is an open

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,390
source and it allows hosted to roam

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,390
multi-core to machine tonight

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:28,160
we have p vm built and helium is the

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:32,030
extension of helium it allows the

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,300
virtual machines to be an are real kind

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,750
of system actually the printer Archie

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,600
Patrick enables in its kernel to be a

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,190
routing system and the real-time PBM

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:49,220
allows virtu motion to be written

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:53,110
real-time resolution system so how I

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:58,220
employed rhythm helium in the entire

00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:01,160
hotel is an open source software or

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,310
building the private or public cloud if

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,760
the cloud and cloud operating system

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,370
which controls that most of the software

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,630
of the natural resources computing

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:19,780
resources and storage resources it has

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:22,040
many projects and there are many

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,970
deployments configurations

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,490
people can choose to deploy some of

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,220
these projects to testify the business

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,430
requirements are satisfied

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,290
rather he didn't comment for example

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,800
they are kids though is responsible for

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,980
the education services the waffles the

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,320
network services and nuclear force and

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,440
network associated services and know

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,560
about computing services so that's back

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,930
to the key via our new champion the

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,200
rhythm KVM it provides the route come

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:59,920
come complete from our solutions so it's

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,060
many many really relating lisanova

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,670
projects so we suppose that the

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,650
Hollywood have Kimia actually is many

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:18,460
configure in the Nova so in this picture

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:21,790
remittances are the the bottom is a

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:24,490
completely computer hardware and we as

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,330
in course and we install the rhythm TBM

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:31,570
and we owe to the real champion using

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:35,760
the Liberals as the rhythm kill me

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:38,710
restrict women's requirements so if

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,770
actually in front of this me to special

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:45,960
configurations I will talk this one by

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:51,730
one the first visa conducted for the

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:57,250
computer knows first part however we use

00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:59,960
the standard as 86 thirds and another is

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,569
the real-time deployment

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,509
the best that happen we need to disable

00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:08,569
some options which we call the Highland

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,490
DC in the bells for examples happens

00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,490
threatening it'll be easy water and

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:19,639
actually some vendors they provide our

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,380
documents to set up a lowland easy

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,919
system so we can follow these

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:28,759
instructions after that how we can use

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:31,430
the halfway are immediately had to do

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:35,990
this to to check if it's ready it has

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:39,140
some standards and we can run maybe 24

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,399
hours to check if it's ready so this is

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,550
a hardware packs software that's

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,459
something where the reason is we need to

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:53,930
use all the real-time tactics when we

00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:58,480
start very early on Colonel you'd have

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:03,380
an OPM and the team and the trainer and

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,529
we also need to partition in the house

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,079
of horrors into notice the one part is

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:12,770
real-time process or as it's the course

00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:17,540
they are they have hidden cross so the

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:22,029
hot chemicals is a regular efficiency

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:26,720
colonel Allah Hafiz in house and also

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:30,140
default use housekeeping horse father as

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,100
a little cards they are they are not

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:38,900
used only if you explicit pin in Punjab

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,589
initial to the

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:46,930
Rubirosa so the stationary important in

00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:53,690
the rhythm set up and also in the cute a

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:57,050
previous part answer at eighty Sixers

00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,770
the heap the numbers memory each style

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:05,980
is the focus of X and the instance is

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:09,880
when he but our two men base mind that

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:13,810
there are some of the huge advantages of

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:17,990
Perseids memories without so even though

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,480
the system is and a very fine memories

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,450
start a memory stress is nervous work

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,080
out and also because it's hidden in

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:29,779
style so it had health it is so it

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,490
conceals the last phase of the system

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:38,240
and another is it have already be called

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:42,260
by some moments because it has the meat

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:47,000
that she'll be administration is more

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:52,190
less so this is the software under

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,220
commitment after the conditionals are

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:59,390
ready now we can define a virtual

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:02,209
machine using the liver works so they

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:07,850
are I need to have a two points the one

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:10,520
is the basic basic routine first as cars

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,160
use the for the virtual machines they

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,459
need to estimate either and this part

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,310
should not be overlaps so it means eight

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:22,070
week in one house at heart

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:26,630
this person never painted to another

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:29,060
resolution so the car cannot be shared

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,630
with our Liberty machines otherwise the

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:36,680
performance will be bad

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:40,190
also inside the basic use we also need

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,520
to specify the emulators accused in your

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:47,410
little cars force virtual machines which

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,990
is used for the bikinis rights and

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:55,480
another we need to specify using the

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,480
filtrate for the commercial destination

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:03,200
this is an example in this example we

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,860
use anger for advice memories for the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:12,260
virtual machine and which is using uh-oh

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:16,130
one memory bathroom and the ways that's

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:18,589
2 CPUs the basic use there are no ifs if

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,279
you see through individual as in course

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:26,480
the visitor is into the secure to the

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:32,540
host power 18 and the Liceo one is given

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:35,960
to the host city of 19 so the emulator

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,560
diffuse values different costs and also

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:44,230
all the visibility has a FIFO scheduler

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:50,410
priority this is the example of the

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,410
virtual machine if definition after the

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:59,350
Caminos and the destination money we

00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:02,110
still need to set up inside the guest is

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,380
a large mission we see me too if those

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,019
of you can practice and we still is

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,170
including the colonel our team practice

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:15,579
and practice inside the test and we also

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:18,639
need two participants the cars into two

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:24,459
groups as big Hoss and housekeeping

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:27,130
house so so this is the this is setup

00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:29,560
firms come he knows from the VM

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,190
definition and from the set up a sand

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,209
castle

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:38,220
so so what's out it reflects in the

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:41,050
concepts that happened actually the

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,320
deployment of the own studies company

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,079
either so if we follow this once the bus

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,880
stop 70 very calmly so there are many

00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:54,579
tools even hands that we have we have we

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,250
are using director to deploy phones

00:13:54,579 --> 00:14:00,699
which already said our human server and

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:04,510
will be at will it will employ a variety

00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:09,430
of different components and also of

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:11,860
others of many other servers so for

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,910
about three parts configuration we need

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,319
to contain it in the director and at all

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,209
can 6000

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:22,450
all of them can be

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:25,839
but in the community version I mean it

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,899
is truth to follow the steps of the on

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,589
stack official government we need to

00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,480
make the many relates to the

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:37,540
configuration is the donor cups we need

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,420
to specify which cars will be in through

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,890
the promotion's is no buckling Feb and

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:47,339
we also need to use a flavor which sets

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:51,070
the route I'm a genius in Queenie the

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:57,010
and teach the CP policy and the memory

00:14:51,070 --> 00:15:04,360
and so on so this is the configuration

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:07,329
and those who are testing burns we test

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:12,220
women intestines trees and her defenses

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:16,029
narrows the first single VM this means

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,540
we drum only one one earth machines on

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:22,800
both houses and each virtual machine has

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,570
one route ham co-wrote ham car and

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,600
forgiving car

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:33,220
Dennis narrow is multi videos withdrawn

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:39,790
when party machine each missed and these

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:42,790
accused and a little person to have

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:47,200
given us and certain areas about Indians

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,360
we will run always hit with a single

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,880
room

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:58,130
first and Cinco have Kingdom Hearts

00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:04,430
because the rhythm the performance may

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:07,770
be related to the hardware so so in our

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,410
city of have in our server and in our

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,890
server happens if you disease are

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,640
enhancing the Ducks way you stop we use

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:22,070
a spectacle tassel true to the family

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:27,990
past eight are two two petals are

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:32,670
fantasy so this is a patent read out a

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,040
mystery snails we have the average we

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,800
have the minimum lengthy the average

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,270
latency and of Maxim magazine actually

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:45,330
we don't care about much about the

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,970
minimum engine every fantasy because we

00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,970
clear we care most of the maximum and

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:53,730
London say because the main thing they

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,180
should never be exceeded the limit is

00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:01,260
rendering and our threshold is a 40

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:04,050
micro seconds so you are testing we from

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,780
these three test cases each each phase

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:10,860
running 24 hours

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:15,090
so after 24 hours the musician should

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:19,250
always within the 40 micro seconds

00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:28,929
otherwise we there may be problems so

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:32,900
and the B level is our is our own

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:37,340
spicy far away tester we test our

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:39,770
original course besides we doing on that

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,710
we have heaven stress in the half

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:47,660
kidding course we compare colonel in the

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:52,100
boastful pain both host and guests are

00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:55,549
happy because so which me consume almost

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:58,850
100% of the resources so we are doing

00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:02,150
our testing ones system and the hair

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,080
pressure so this means that and the hair

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:09,250
pressure returns then it should always

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:14,530
within this for the forty milliseconds

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,940
so this is our testing results and

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,750
that's all thank you

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,750
any questions

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,730
