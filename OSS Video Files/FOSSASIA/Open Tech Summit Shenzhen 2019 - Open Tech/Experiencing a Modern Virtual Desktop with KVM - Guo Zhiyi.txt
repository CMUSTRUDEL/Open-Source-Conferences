[Applause]

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:17,130
hello tree war for redheads and city are

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:21,390
collinear and folks are in the graphic

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:27,210
for citations as many books with endo

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:41,969
and anemia and my releasing these

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:45,960
solutions inside yeah so this man hobby

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:53,219
is to introduce both desktops as many

00:00:45,960 --> 00:01:00,390
hours here at least infrastructure yes

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:04,860
so results communities and open source

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:11,270
version business software uses austere

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:16,820
environment so no simply making the

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,750
components as community so the water is

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,939
completed the water addition

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,430
infrastructure that you love the team

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,330
and basically whose all components

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,750
the first one is km that is a Kenobi's

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:34,810
virtual machine that can provide all

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:38,590
different solutions for the labels and

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:43,360
this is the most popular solution for a

00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:47,680
lot of providers and the same and the

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,729
second is the 3m you that the canary

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,490
will consist of a lot of angling magnets

00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:58,060
that can provide a lot of options like

00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:03,070
the memory the what's the CPU and the

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:07,690
islands so so the cube and the 3m you'll

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:13,780
actually is and he's not food apparently

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:17,440
there is many for some food burns

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:21,360
so there are food leader who leaders as

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:26,440
colony were and to the world makers and

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,950
the user experience and special to

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:34,360
breathless command s physical network

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,220
and also from the two is new campus who

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,890
have used

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:56,820
as other traditions Oh actually they're

00:02:40,890 --> 00:03:01,020
all so we must meet those rulers the

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,230
Euler kitties that's to reenact to our

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,300
testings and message to our

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,030
investigations apartment customers so

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:15,270
the desktops to the cases from the

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:19,709
customers this as their first their nest

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:22,890
of those other toaster oven so they

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:26,760
always lose their desktop inside data

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,310
segments and told all the ranking

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,220
campaigns the work here we go very

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,970
powerful machines than the justly give

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,970
you both machines then can provide the

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,019
desktop experience to you and just

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,030
beautiful

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,720
we're missing the double sink right west

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:52,190
coast that's true they can reduce their

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,680
locality have greater good customers and

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:58,739
forward as far less house so if you want

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,640
to use them so you do need the other

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:05,970
people's I think most people

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,650
the real functions and all the functions

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:17,250
that if you ran some software's inside a

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:21,090
simple example if you want to use your

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,430
office inside your washing machine so if

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:32,670
something round and without giving

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:36,690
without have all of our booth so the you

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,870
cannot you cannot miss you cannot miss

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:43,710
this thing is so this myth we need me

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,890
great you have bad experience so we must

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:52,940
know about all the functions of the F

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:57,450
house for the workmen in activity and

00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:00,780
for you for incredulous you may have a

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:04,520
lot of we do conferences so what you

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,620
machine wouldn't provide legal

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,820
conference cameras so you will give to

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,690
your job into the best cameras that can

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,600
pass through to the cloud then you have

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:22,200
a view to the complex content and the

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,919
voice from this both machines and the

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,850
last one is the perfect communities so a

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,410
lot of people because the regular heavy

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:38,370
heavy computing software this software

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:44,990
the way they do some marketing I like

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:50,509
the Direct X of opt on so

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:57,629
[Music]

00:05:50,509 --> 00:06:00,740
also provide you these capabilities so

00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:05,940
so let's see the fully open source

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:09,030
solutions already to the either p.m. so

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,840
if you know this is called the specs

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,599
project

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,680
so from these pictures so you can see

00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:19,800
that there are typically three computers

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,949
these results the first time is your

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,360
local machines that may be the new

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,949
system of ecosystem and there are two

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,750
computers actually connected to your

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:43,259
workspace when to be well to be are low

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:46,860
but to be because washing machines so

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:51,780
the best progress is in studied append

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,330
records that is Destry into the distance

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,710
from the enterprise rulers and this

00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:03,000
rulers family was the was destined for

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:06,210
dirty people for their daily lives so

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,569
talk about early space projects it right

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:14,400
a lot of functions nestor business

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:20,099
people or really what was the first

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,279
value that this is travel and you can so

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,669
big

00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:28,449
Hawkins you may be the only print on

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:34,119
never the smaller table of families with

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:38,019
you as what with your do come up we go

00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:41,769
exist in the cloud space and the center

00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:45,669
and sector lucky that the people stocks

00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:49,689
there are worth less up to negligence so

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:52,989
the space project provides a lot of this

00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:54,389
algorithm that can help you make this

00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:57,789
possible

00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:00,279
so from the wheels through the window

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:07,589
screaming and the desktop content that

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:07,589
is very very very perfect the fastest

00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:16,629
transformers are naughty couple times

00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:19,059
they bring a lot of fat lines compute

00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,209
results so with the window screaming and

00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:25,719
the weasel completion to this video

00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:29,949
screenings and limit result so that we

00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:32,500
can we can reduce we can reduce the

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:36,360
network beauties and prevents the

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:42,540
qualities and transfer law we have below

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:46,290
plans for others or all of the web

00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:53,220
detector is also also possible with the

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:56,370
best business best projects that asked

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,980
the voice the less either this I think

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,180
us that's the spice project we all have

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:07,440
to transfer the transferor voice all the

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:12,750
lumps of the applications we are into

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,300
your flanks and if possible transfer the

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,620
voice product from your bedroom and the

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:25,770
other audio audio optical devices who

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:30,150
has interest so forgiveness for the

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,200
image people's so the best there are who

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,590
was boss

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,140
that's kinda let you to correct your USB

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:42,600
devices than the regular cameras and

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,590
understands mock up all the goodies to

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,640
our questions to help you people to give

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:58,200
us the permanent workspace then you can

00:09:50,640 --> 00:10:01,110
access from era Commons for the best

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,100
products than thickening of the Emily

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:08,670
wettest and beauty cream earlier we have

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:14,280
your applications that with highly

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:16,790
optimized to execute lattice and highly

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,790
optimized

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,790
so these three of those vests protects

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:27,930
the qemu and the cast members three

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:35,560
companies a scanner can provide you the

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:38,110
memory very smooth experience so follows

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,320
follow the law students who follow the

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,060
death house and with the legacy is best

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,720
protect it

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:50,560
very well mr. very easy for you to

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,970
preach the simplest house with servants

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,210
because if see right max that from this

00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:01,480
pictures you can see the besides the

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:05,110
legacy computer resources like the CPU

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,260
and the memory and the entities so you

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:11,680
can't ask you the very same of math less

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:16,230
common graphics and video to let your

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:21,220
emotions for you the best products and

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:26,260
services for best us put here for Wes to

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:30,220
deep experience for this polish pictures

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:36,610
and actress Catholics grateful and

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,589
verified this from our systems but our

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,780
roses

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,780
adorn our system is also free and

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:53,670
that also you can also see you can also

00:11:50,670 --> 00:12:02,160
see operations through the directs the

00:11:53,670 --> 00:12:03,899
priest the similar experience so for the

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,370
character was so-called

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:15,830
current cases I think because of the

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,830
[Music]

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:24,120
becoming and yeah there are people there

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,660
also give our family three key functions

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:32,279
of the health to provide rulers the best

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:35,760
appearance but disturb at an east-west

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:41,700
can still be qualified to the sweetie

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:45,300
who's the former general actually I

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,830
think is not from my daily settings with

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,700
the street you were close

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:53,640
if we only use analytic devices created

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:58,620
from the Roman sauce from the level next

00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,680
moments of the committee's video close

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,959
we'll talk there are these very bad

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,640
moments for the 3d workers and

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,970
experience left the left the tracks are

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,350
left to beauty everything to utilize

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,910
family brightness of

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:24,190
is Swedish mobility that is to eat less

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:28,950
feel good if you're if you are sick your

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:33,210
resources and if you over if you marry

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:37,900
if you rather very - applications dance

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:40,120
Henry equals 3t x3d functions let's all

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,850
your resources will be used for

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:52,270
computing industry D and if you make

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:54,730
your system as possible if you even

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:59,710
exist if it has all the resources

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:03,760
problem is it can only provide you very

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:06,190
low previous four seconds left

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:13,390
you know me feel like you have play some

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:17,140
static pictures inside so big and so for

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:21,490
investing for testing if versions and

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:25,900
for which the US and a sticklebacks

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:29,680
grams less when we travel around which

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:34,540
parts that is very popular which part of

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,570
the heavens very very low settings Mac

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,790
that from very low resolution and very

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,790
low will politics become holy

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:54,120
yes usually ends and they're also check

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:58,590
the the whole heap of video games

00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:03,900
let's go for two hundred and forty

00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:08,010
percent less actually I'm not response

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,610
and any infections the visual and other

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:18,810
resources has to be being defaced and 3d

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:22,340
applications so so the open source

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:27,180
community and current extreme want

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:30,810
Hannah Mary's death house the less with

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:37,170
various with s house that's we can offer

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:41,700
the graphic intensive the cube is very

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:51,650
popular idea for for I think a lot of

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:58,400
the rulers other than proud users so the

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:58,400
goodness of technologies and

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:09,600
[Music]

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:15,410
the treaty that formulating help with if

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:20,009
you want to do this harvest harvest

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:24,059
celebrations to your practical practical

00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:25,080
food to the very close so when you want

00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,909
to

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,909
[Music]

00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:40,499
we only look very much if you that can

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:45,019
provide that can provide some cover IDs

00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:48,629
for this from all these technologies and

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:53,220
because of cost is going on water

00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:56,970
machines that some of those that might

00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:00,540
be transferred to the host that's to let

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:08,730
you control two devices on the host so

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:25,220
the new nice time that follows from the

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:25,220
we have food and fact this it has also

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:41,220
[Music]

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:46,789
because that means that some of the some

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,789
of the host particles may be interrupt

00:17:51,950 --> 00:18:03,510
the technology because you know the

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:07,830
conditions is 42 more traditional that

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:13,130
because it's also related to nutrients

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:18,870
but this this activity versus control

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:23,210
for the host because huge West less the

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:28,710
host CPU addresses how to compute the

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:30,770
particle in the host and try to and try

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,770
to

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,400
[Music]

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:48,910
solutions that all of what was basic you

00:18:51,280 --> 00:19:00,050
see you if that is not good enough to

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:21,830
replace the gradual complete the traffic

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:25,100
those comments against 3d so also is

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:28,910
very easy so you just you can just post

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,170
various in Hawkman let's look at us to

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,500
the very civic-minded

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:39,970
that can that we operate or what was

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,970
included in the day

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:52,400
conceived in diverse energy work in the

00:19:46,160 --> 00:20:03,010
different xn are the experimented

00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:11,120
scriptures the movie mmm with our

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:14,030
ability to methods I also married so I

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:25,310
also mirrors the 3d performance inside

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:29,240
the machines impurities so from this

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:33,820
what machines you can see that you will

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,820
do already it aquatic of the latest

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:44,680
Barbic steps that developed Bandito

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:51,860
companies that you can decompress two

00:20:44,680 --> 00:21:04,930
days open to your board five out of six

00:20:51,860 --> 00:21:06,659
and party step let's movie also

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,099
[Music]

00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:13,559
that is 200 yen and I also have a

00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:17,549
handless in computers - in Crete far

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:23,960
away the sink our business is an ESPN so

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:27,539
newcastle ago that we would I believe it

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:34,789
because his own which one you have only

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:40,590
gets the standard FPS for his essence

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:47,489
people interviewed best this comments

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:50,989
the increase from have a very ever

00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:55,669
matter 458

00:21:50,989 --> 00:22:02,700
yes from running this page fax that's

00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:05,429
actually babies as a result I think we

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:11,960
will find some business applications

00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:20,029
that as thing if you will vary with

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:24,929
simple waters of all the others always

00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:28,559
always those that involve the fracture

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:31,289
the tremor experience that you have a

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:36,160
guest you can get a very good experience

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:44,940
that the volume

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:44,940
very very active experiment you had

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:59,650
action was very smooth and if you were

00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:05,530
cold and is already just for the 90%

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:10,360
that for rehab systemness for civil

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:13,690
aggressive and for help or civil records

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:19,900
that you can use yokas enough for civil

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:30,910
power to process the other tasks that

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:35,110
are insensitive to the civil 200 so this

00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:38,670
is so this is when last page this is the

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:42,160
last piece of math less so this is

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:44,400
technologies for the desktop that I

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,400
think

00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:55,380
in the south of communities the first

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:59,760
line is that the Maserati our three

00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:04,140
teams strategic about it this strategy

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:08,100
that is it also related to dress is

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,679
using the free annual applications but

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,370
the difference between the next

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:17,010
incorrect

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:21,660
aromatics and this issue is that this

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:25,679
radicchio dress is also the workers from

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:29,390
the sweetie workload from the VM include

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:34,830
on who the host recruit basis as a

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:38,040
reward in what Carol and any any two

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,970
dresses from different weathers also

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:52,250
work can also work these open source

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:56,280
projects trial solutions who only

00:24:52,250 --> 00:25:06,030
traveling Kathy also know desktops

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:10,460
oceans to MD only in another very

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:15,830
exciting very exciting

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:17,840
that I think that maybe some people know

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,740
that they thought that already released

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:28,460
there are there are discrete GPU dresses

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:32,600
for the data signals very just at least

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:39,530
the next error is performance X like the

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:42,860
beast in two accelerations will hospital

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:47,600
body of this disgrace to addresses that

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:49,960
it can provide of all if at all the

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:55,730
market performance with almost machines

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:59,090
all we can share this chart is to

00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:04,610
progresses to to more rulers better

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:07,630
without that will be that we not each

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,630
interaction there

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:57,890
yes yes I'm far from the net yeah that's

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,890
because the the just because that's the

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:09,990
[Music]

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:13,890
previous two modules that's because

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:39,890
that's what I know sweetie what goes

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:45,570
inside now we said I think this message

00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:57,720
but bastard definitely need at least a

00:27:45,570 --> 00:28:04,800
space to transfer gonna be different so

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:12,120
currently yes we have no more advice the

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:14,360
advice you can yo see who has so we see

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,360
this

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:51,440
for the next we also need we also need a

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:56,300
software then to capture the capital F

00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:03,500
for division that and puts this image to

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:08,090
the economy to include the rules are

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:16,300
which are which to 6 exclusive 4 equals

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:16,300
6 5 and they have to finish real streets

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,700
[Music]

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:25,010
you will get similar experience like

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,410
learners you will get the same

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:31,670
experience left the graphic content

00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:34,510
inside the VM and the standard and the

00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,510
behavior from

00:29:38,220 --> 00:30:08,480
because of all 15 from media change to

00:29:47,820 --> 00:30:08,480
give you access to the okay thank you

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,890
