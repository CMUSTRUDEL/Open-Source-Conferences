how are told so the core mission of AR

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:16,560
is to overlay the reality with the

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,690
Grateful image and I say if we get if we

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,270
can make it working as good as in Star

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,270
Wars then we really solve the problem

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:32,730
but they're so kind of many challenges

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:38,550
remaining and for instance take the

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:43,230
device all and stay you might know but

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:46,530
it's just so bulky and not so nice to

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,020
look at that it looks more like Robocop

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:54,649
and it's definitely not something that

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:58,710
you're gonna wear all day and and that

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:01,980
challenge comes with the price because

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,729
again for instance all of this starts

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,150
starts at the price of 3500 US dollars

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,810
and that's far out of the reach of an

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,159
average individual and especially for

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,100
students also and and there also are

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,340
companies like magically but they still

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:30,049
don't solve the problem in a better way

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:34,400
and the third challenge is that public

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:37,890
expectation of AR is very very high and

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,610
that's because most of the people who

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,000
saw something about AR it was an

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,170
animation and it wasn't actually

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,770
rendered online on an AR bus so they

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:58,610
expect to see crazy things and then it's

00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:01,850
wrong and and because there

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:07,970
still so many remaining challenges

00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:11,930
there's no convincing solution until now

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,900
and because of that students here from

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,440
this campus and wanted to learn more

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:22,340
about it and by actually starting a

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:27,140
project and learning by proposing our

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:31,459
own culture space and as I said we

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:35,890
started for you four weeks ago by

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:40,820
defining like what are our most core

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:43,820
problems that we want to solve and so we

00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:47,390
said we want to or trying to make the

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,670
device that has a price lower than the

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,770
price of a smartphone and you might

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:58,850
think why smartphone nearly everybody

00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:02,720
can afford a smartphone so if we have if

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,570
we manage to make a device and they are

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,530
device this has a lower price than an

00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,730
average smartphone

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,530
it's truly affordable and the second

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,930
point that is really important for us is

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,470
that is good-looking

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:21,200
that means it's good-looking and less

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,660
coffee in other words something that you

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:30,890
actually wanna wear and can wear for a

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:33,830
whole day and with those all in mind we

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,220
actually already did three prototypes it

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:44,450
goes four weeks so we advanced quite

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:48,549
quickly and we have two core points that

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:53,750
we came up with the first point is that

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:58,420
we do most of the heavy computations on

00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:01,190
the phone because nearly and all the

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,600
smart phones nowadays are actually

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,580
complete

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:09,970
quite powerful and if we do that also

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:14,370
the advantage is that we can reduce the

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:18,220
size of the board of the AR device

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,610
really significantly and this reduces

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,940
the price of the overall AR classes and

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:29,770
it also makes it possible to make it I

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:32,770
say less bulky and the third part is

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,770
like a nice advantages that the power

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:39,430
consumption is is much lower that allows

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,400
again to make smaller actress and this

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,120
again reduces the size to a enter

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,160
overall cost of the device and as you

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:55,630
can see Part C we the our reward is this

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,670
ESP based board and even though it's

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:02,890
five smallest astonishingly

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:06,850
ro and can handle on my face detection

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:11,050
and recognition and still do on the same

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:15,460
time like video downstream to upon we

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:19,810
are white and it costs $30 sorry three

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:24,340
three years audible and the second part

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,580
that we really focus on this the optical

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,270
system because the optical system is one

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:34,840
of the main reasons why why AR devices

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:40,750
are so all P so heavy and so expensive

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:43,870
and we really try to reduce the

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,630
complexity of the optical system and

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,960
build that we started with the most

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,139
simple thing that one can do and we just

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,479
at the beginning which is place and

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:59,969
in front of and and now we are using

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,889
transparent OLED display and with a

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:07,499
small distance like a few millimeters to

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,960
the display we have a lens in order that

00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:12,590
the human eye can focus actually on it

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,560
because the human eye can focus on

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:20,849
distances are objects that are near than

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,090
like more or less 10 centimeters so

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:29,300
that's the big birthday of the project

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:32,580
and now we the next step basically is to

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,379
have a display which has a higher pixel

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,819
density and also supports RGB colors so

00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:46,250
that we can actually make that we can

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:50,310
make our first useful applications and

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:54,089
yeah so that was a short top-level

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:58,919
overview of the project and in case you

00:06:54,089 --> 00:07:01,169
have any questions or are interested in

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,139
the project better ask them immediately

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:06,300
afterwards or also ignominy and WeChat

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:12,740
because I won't be able to attend

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,740
tomorrow and if not yeah made a RP

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,279
