00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,840
let's start today right

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:36,450
so Open Text summer 2019 min Qiang Qiang

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:38,340
yes we're here absolutely and yeah we

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,570
know that it's always a bit challenging

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,190
to start we have story last year so city

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,680
is very like so many people sign up

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,660
where are they in the morning so we know

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,660
that it's challenging sometimes to find

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,340
the place and so on it's no problem and

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,100
I see we just like have people browsing

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,940
in you guys come down here and join us

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,010
and so I think it doesn't stop us from

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,960
actually getting into the topic and I

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,119
think we have already like seen like a

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,390
lot of interesting people joining us

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,390
here

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,230
Tech Talks and so on so what is the

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,830
program of today and what we do we'll go

00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:21,370
through a few slides that you guys and

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,160
yes so we have the open tech summit here

00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:27,640
this is the QR code by the way for we

00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:33,670
checked it's not sauce but it's the

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,650
messenger China so yeah we have to

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,760
somehow communicate with each other with

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,380
everyone so this is the solution we do

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,690
in China s you know it's sometimes

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,910
difficult to use other solutions so and

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,090
we've solutions for anyone else

00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,770
questions about the messenger which is

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,520
not open source but maybe we can talk

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:57,460
with a ten-cent here they're also based

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:17,100
in China future yeah let's go step by

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:20,620
step so this time and maybe even more so

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,530
we were moving to another place open

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,490
gesture

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:30,930
so this year we do something different

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:35,280
and maybe we are going to communicate

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:39,260
with each other and I hope you will

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,750

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,920

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,410

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:14,160
let's do this together so we have

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,840
different tracks here so the

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,180
registration is open here at the moment

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,660
we move the registration to the open

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,360
Fiesta Building open Fiesta what does it

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,850
stand for open yes because I know some

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Spanish people saying yes it's a Fiesta

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:46,620
Fiesta means party in Spanish so but

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:50,150
what does it actually say in China we

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:56,319
are quite into this room is too and

00:03:50,150 --> 00:04:01,670
new innovative ways to enemy students so

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:07,280
so it's really a pleasure to graduate

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:10,610
with procedure context and again we come

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,610
back to the schedule and so what's the

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:19,609
plan so yesterday we had two already

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:22,669
watching Bay and then a meet-up function

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:25,490
map right and in the evening we had a

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,039
nice dinner was wonderful it was she

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,260
junk food so it's always like really

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:32,750
nice to also experience the local

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:38,120
culture in China so many cultures so

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:41,259
it's really so who will say by the way

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,259
[Music]

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:48,979
good fun right cool and so today we

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:55,039
start the morning in the main track and

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:56,840
then we move after noon - really talks

00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,160
our friends from Red Hat will give

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,510
workshops and systems we call it an

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,300
umbrella covering different topics and

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:08,720
and of course we have hardware makers

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,330
and workshop or office or video and

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,639
almost still to be practical and how to

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,710
do things right so we have two areas

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,510
which is every deep tech and then we

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,419
also have areas for people who want to

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,470
like just know how to use open source

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:26,810
software in practical way the plan that

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,960
is for the evening that we have the

00:05:26,810 --> 00:06:28,120
social dinner that will also be

00:05:30,960 --> 00:06:30,580
but I think we could also use this is a

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,300
call to the participants here so what

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,000
will happen

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,690
we have a big space in the space we have

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,580
different tables and at these tables

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:46,600
people can showcase their projects but

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:49,390
they can also sit down and if you have

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:53,070
any sort of project that you like to

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,070
showcase their that's your chance

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,060
China's obviously so flexible we can

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,600
always fit more people so so that's not

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,600
really the problem

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,930
[Music]

00:07:42,630 --> 00:08:30,360
so see you work together continuously

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,459
[Music]

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:48,850
so now they focus more

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:52,540
I hope TLT solutions also we have open

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:59,870
eye which is like

00:08:52,540 --> 00:09:01,870
open a open source a I Community Chest

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,790
star

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:30,370
the continent and we are quite honored

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:32,650
to be the channel so we can communicate

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,430
with each other and you can answer

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:43,300
questions to each other so Open Text

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:46,420
summit 2019 so I give the points to you

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,420
[Music]

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:54,990
yes I think we're running a little bit

00:09:50,440 --> 00:10:00,040
late I think we go because we will go to

00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:06,250
explore this more tomorrow so maybe I

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,760
believe stage tomorrow to have the first

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,760
