which is the goal of the free end of the

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:18,080
sauce software in the digital economy

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:28,099
please welcome Mario yeah so I'm

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:30,779
thankful so that I can start and yeah

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:34,079
free home sauce in the digital economy

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,030
and it's very much more like but I want

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,480
to talk a bit about what we are doing at

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,570
for Asia and open tank in Germany and

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,149
show you a bit of our projects so what

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,120
we are doing there it's these areas here

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,730
so all the sauce when people think about

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,890
the sauce they often think about

00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,649
software but actually today it's more

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,750
mobile so hardware in it is skater and

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,699
of course we need to share this

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,530
knowledge with each other so it's all

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,570
about knowledge sharing and where does

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,750
it have it make events so we try to

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,950
bring all this together in enforce Asia

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,680
and yeah how we do how successful are we

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,950
however after doing it and yeah works

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,460
out for us so far so we all have

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,950
our github repositories here and where

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,409
we have on average every 15 minutes and

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,469
merge pull request and we have brought

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,740
people on our mailing lists and it's

00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:34,240
actual developers we focus on developers

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,850
wonderful people are registered in the

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,610
organization we know it's always easy to

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,770
create big numbers but what we see is we

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,929
also see constant activity sometimes

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,700
people come to the goals that they come

00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:48,399
back again and we have regular

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,590
contributions from many people who are

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:56,189
registered and we do coding contest like

00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:00,579
2000 developers we train them also to

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:03,759
work with people here in China because a

00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:07,299
lot of people are from India from

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,489
Vietnam Singapore Malaysia we want to

00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:14,610
warn you in China that's also one reason

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:17,980
why we cooperate with university

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,280
so those dozens of face to face meetings

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:26,620
have many meetups and we have 100

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:31,799
authors of articles on our what people

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:35,109
find it through search engines so what

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,569
what we're doing is we are making free

00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:42,549
and open source and open technologies

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:44,319
become true we will doing it and here

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:45,480
are a little bit more in cents so we

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,799
started to do

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,049
events already in 2009 the first events

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,930
the first virtual event that we ran was

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,330
the globe Asia Summit in Vietnam and

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,480
there was a huge success we write we

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,170
have 1400 people that was overwhelming

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,620
and so we encouraged us to do more but

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,450
we do in India you know very strong in

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,099
software and of course they have the

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,870
advantage that they have English as a

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,329
mother tongue which is always

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,340
challenging for us who are not native

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,890
English speakers right I mean I'm German

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,590
is close to English relatively easy to

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,310
learn but we know what some people's

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,010
beginning which is it's a bit further

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,560
for Indians that is easier and we want

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,829
to do more regional events we want to do

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,530
more global events so that's the next

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,959
step we have very active developer

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,700
community and if you check out the

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:48,480
github charts there many different ways

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:51,109
to check that activity then we are one

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,109
of the top organizations

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,820
let me try this at a microphone here so

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,390
for seizures currently number 14 on

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,340
github in regards to follow us and

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,850
activity and so you can check this out

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:17,489
the organization maintains so media 14

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:19,170
and microsoft but we're not so far away

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:22,049
and this is pretty amazing

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,000
for a community organization and it

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,390
still be company for sale as company

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,060
registered in singapore but it's more

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,640
like a company all out of the community

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,930
so community is amazing and the company

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,840
helps to develop like products that

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,140
support the community that generally

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,919
income for the others so we are working

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:49,680
on more quality software now and we have

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,870
large numbers of people who also need to

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,210
do more quality because a lot of people

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,700
in the community in the canton the main

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,890
goal is to learn something and we're

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,900
doing very well here and we want to do

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,419
more also actually in regards to

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,460
developing products that many people can

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:11,330
use so as I mentioned earlier not just

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,490
software today it's hardware and

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:17,850
changing is a great place to be for

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:24,510
hardware we have built product expertise

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:27,060
and it's not always about making a

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,169
software or making a hardware right

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,030
always have it on the github repository

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,600
it's really difficult actually than to

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,910
produce

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,920
integrating to market it's nearly as

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,980
much work some people say it's even more

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,870
work than just about the hardware so we

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,090
have developed this expertise we know

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,400
what we work together of course we have

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,930
an advantage that for example above all

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,240
people in Singapore they speak Chinese

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,050
it can work with Chinese manufacturers

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,780
much easier so that's our idea now that

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,750
we want to do more more Hardware here in

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,550
changing for example so one of the

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:16,850
projects we do in Harper is here the

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:21,720
pocket sensor particular around to

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:25,500
measure all kinds of things and in such

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,920
a barcode I we have to get on the

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,920
Chinese

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:49,900
so it's a developer can it's also yes

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,500
wave generator power sauce and celery

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,960
gently constantly adding more and more

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,790
instruments to this hardware and click

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,180
implemented the firmware implemented in

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:05,500
the software and also enhancing the

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:16,480
hardware beam and forward versions so we

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:23,530
learned how to produce device we did you

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:28,030
know because Japan is very popular in

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,550
Japan and we switch science to pursue

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,500
castle and often each engine also maybe

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,750
some of you know him so he's having what

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,640
would bring this to the community and

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,070
the next guy said we want to do now

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,320
based on this experience is the new

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,140
robot device talks device to

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,110
measurements of the brain waves and

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,840
every person out there but I think we

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:55,680
can go much lower in price and enable a

00:07:49,840 --> 00:08:00,430
much larger community to do new projects

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:09,880
so how do we do this as I said we are

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:13,570
small we are Microsoft and able to us so

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,380
we list of best practices and here are

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,860
just a few

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:24,210
so very simple rules and these rules we

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:27,539
communicate them to new developers

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,479
and from one simple Buddhist match one

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,029
issue on the issue tracker with one pull

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,279
request yeah sounds very simple

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,800
something is somebody will speed

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,070
developer for many years but for newbies

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,380
okay because they try to do sometimes

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,649
just power they work like three weeks or

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,420
one issue and then will be like a huge

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,990
school request if they then combine

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,540
several issues so yeah it will take a

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,459
very long time to review them and I

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,860
could go to detail but I just wanna

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,839
mention this you know so the s-type this

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:08,550
is maybe we can talk about this also

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:11,310
you're doing the event so then also more

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:14,070
long-term partnerships by sharing

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,410
resources with developers so we see for

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,589
example that we have developers and they

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,310
follow the best practices they

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:25,380
participate calling programs and then

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,680
they move on they move on pretty quickly

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:32,310
we have a lot of people now Google

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,140
Facebook and all the companies uber and

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,500
so on we have a lot of people who

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,870
previously here in the projects but what

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,300
we see unfortunately is that then the

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,640
engagement cause as soon as somebody

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,470
joins a big company they don't

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,920
contribute as much as before

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,050
some people stopped entirely this is

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,700
sometimes even the case because of the

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,700
contracts they get they don't even

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,790
permitted always they're not allowed to

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,579
share their knowledge to participate in

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,710
the community and that's set so what we

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:07,730
want to do is we want to change that

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,550
of course together with companies and

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,460
teach them about the value of

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:16,770
participating in the community and they

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,680
could hire new people from the community

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,240
so that's a possibility but also like

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,980
they could participate and collaborate

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,380
with us on projects and this project

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,720
with the processor and we talked about

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:37,470
yesterday already a bit about how we can

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:40,350
collaborate how we can also so let's see

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,630
what we can do and it's not just about

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,760
that everyone wants to be employed by a

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,130
company some people want to have a

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,980
startup so we may startups here in the

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,690
audience yeah who's working with

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:56,640
startups few hands so right people want

00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,740
to draw their own projects they don't

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,600
just want to be hired by somebody and

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,550
want to go home you know their character

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,380
well I'll get started calling her this

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,880
is a great thing

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,610
get this acknowledgement and of course

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,250
earn and income for their family for

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,380
their peers so what we're trying to do

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,830
now is we incubate projects I mentioned

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,770
pockets answer so pockets on set is now

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:22,020
self-sustaining project it already earns

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,970
enough money to paint for us to develop

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,910
the next version and that's pretty cool

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:33,300
this one we did without venture capital

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:35,580
so it's all entirely self-funded and one

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,040
reason is also to be honest and

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:41,390
sometimes difficult to get VC because we

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,390
see has is myself

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:45,829
and one of these projects has to make

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,589
this much money that even the other

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:51,499
projects fail has to make a lot of money

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,239
to pay off for all these projects with

00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:56,209
our goal is wanting to build a

00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:58,309
sustainable ecosystem and companies and

00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,519
projects that continue to develop and

00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:04,369
when all your products come out products

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,160
that help humanity products that maybe

00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:09,319
solve the climate challenge here the

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,480
climate change yeah

00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,519
I couldn't believe so many problems in

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,429
this world I think we should just leave

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,819
it to big money we need to sustainable

00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:23,329
projects that have people so what we do

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:27,739
is we make more projects ready for end

00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:30,470
users for example here Susie a I it's

00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:33,319
particularly more than 300 contributors

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:39,170
I don't know who knows

00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:42,199
Star Trek I don't know okay I don't see

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:48,850
that many hands coming up okay so I'm

00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:53,749
getting older generation it seems so

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:58,129
very cool movies and series for example

00:12:53,749 --> 00:13:01,999
here from 1986 from movie this scene is

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:04,549
my things where Scotty the engineer

00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:08,389
travels back from the future to the past

00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:10,369
or the future and then he is very

00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,679
confused because he tries to communicate

00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:15,889
with the computer and the computer

00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,829
doesn't answer he says hello hello hello

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:22,009
computer and the computer doesn't answer

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:26,929
so what he does is he takes a mouse and

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:31,399
he talks into the bus so already in 86

00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:34,939
the directors of this movie had this

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:41,540
idea that in future what we talk with

00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:47,389
we see the Sun is already driven yeah

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,389
many people and we have today of course

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,869
producers and I think open source

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:10,860
alternative that is respecting our

00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:15,329
privacy so we developed CDI and runs on

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:25,589
many devices and we have a very basic

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:28,829
prototype and not present because our

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:34,259
focus is in the software so we just try

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:36,480
to make Susi air by running on standard

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:38,879
hardware so

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,129
raspberry PR for example standard

00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,199
computers to make this prototype which

00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:47,040
is basically just to test the software

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,410
but transferring on many devices so

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,959
apart from the small speaker just give

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:58,019
around it runs on Android iOS and on

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,709
this month speaker itself and kids how

00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:04,079
we make it and we have a content

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:08,129
management system where you can upload

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,230
the skills may be different topics

00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,509
already that I have to say you can

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,029
actually go to the Susie talk AI and try

00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:19,379
it out but don't expect this to work

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:21,509
every day in my fully fresh we just like

00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:24,120
Google home so this project I'm the head

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,540
of development and we deploy live to get

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,540
our sauce

00:15:27,270 --> 00:16:05,110
this is a future Google actually goes

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,390
through Google or go through Bible

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,580
because I know these big providers and

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,460
they then find the information to do

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,040
well how we do the Internet today is we

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,040
open the browser Eco ourself to the web

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,170
service and the future we go to these

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,040
big providers and they decide what we

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:30,310
can see this this pizza service is not

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:33,630
good it's a service you should be able

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,630
to choose for yourself

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,990
so we have talkback and we have for

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:46,270
example here the way to play video on

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:50,440
YouTube that's all possible already on

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:53,260
the web version and we say why does it

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,050
take so long why is it so difficult to

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:59,830
make skills has anyone in trying to make

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,690
a skill on action like a website uses an

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,320
excerpt so that's possible in trying to

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:09,700
make this skills for in Excel has a

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:12,430
majority to that not even a single

00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:17,700
person one of you guys have to give it

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,700
to this when we are you

00:17:18,140 --> 00:18:20,490
so yeah so we develop the language of

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:24,000
thought we said it should be as easy as

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:33,600
editing article on the wiki yeah it's

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:38,060
very simple in English and so how do we

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,430
get together now this is the question so

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,500
we have many events like something here

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,230
you see the sign that day where we

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,790
exchange all these ones that I just

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:54,120
introduced and we run coding programs so

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,100
I hope you could run all these programs

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,300
may be here to China also punch on that

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,300
so what we do

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,160
over there and then the top contributors

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:09,490
in the coding contest that we get a

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,920
court in contest they will receive a

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,230
price and that they will fly to the

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,320
prestigious event in Singapore maybe we

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,750
could do that future China that the top

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,690
contributors winner price rejection or

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:26,020
come to Beijing and meet up with other

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,040
developers something like that and we

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,750
will do more of this of course and also

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:37,210
the first Academy that we started in

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:40,330
Singapore it's government certified

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,550
courses and of course the focus and free

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:49,080
open source only so Marco one of our

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:54,990
leaders in the community I think

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,990
something participated this robotics

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:09,520
robotics Marco yeah this is okay so at

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:12,730
the end I say open technology is here we

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,429
have many more content events and what

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,770
we also realized just the last few weeks

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:19,929
of the event for example tomorrow

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,300
there's also Apache them and then

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:24,510
there's also comedy even also one of the

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,510
source

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,910
I think it's really positive with so

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,430
much hope it's all sorts of a so much

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,260
sharing going on here and at school and

00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:38,080
we want to be a driving force with force

00:20:35,260 --> 00:21:13,030
seizure here and two more on this so

00:20:38,080 --> 00:21:16,560
let's make open take around sex again

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,560
