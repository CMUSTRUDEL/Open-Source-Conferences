00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,829
[Music]

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,530
[Music]

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:49,910
so info is abstract away specifics so

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:54,420
this is the law here connecting the

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:58,230
central heart this is Lawrence come over

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,130
this is the basic component of the of

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:06,680
the image and is also the a stream a

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,680
stream of swim

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,660
[Music]

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:44,259
[Music]

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,670
so

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,379
[Music]

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,110
[Music]

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,260
[Music]

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,260
Oh

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,750
[Music]

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:18,949
[Music]

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:31,120
[Music]

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:35,590
and also we suppose this back from the

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,150
age so you can transmute it so how do

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,400
you study make sure we have to waste we

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:46,620
will study each build on first time why

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:51,790
is to use the green value if you choose

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:55,240
from black and you can't get better

00:05:51,790 --> 00:06:21,720
feedstock also we can use the Saronic

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:21,720
juice so I suppose

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,329
[Music]

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,670
[Music]

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,040
[Music]

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:28,640
next we will choose that dark composer

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:34,419
and then you can continue available to

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,419
allow access by hand by council

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,730
[Music]

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:33,310
so now you can say this is so you saw

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:38,550
the image on the other leg to cover up

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,550
the speed of the screen just America and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,730
how we image

00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,770
so

00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:24,979
weird st takla without cocaine he said

00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:28,519
he stayed some negatives here we can use

00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:39,499
to miss out into the image just have

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:44,049
something to turn over what you want and

00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:47,869
