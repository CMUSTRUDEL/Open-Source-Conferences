Title: Pocket Science Lab - Chung Wei Tat
Publication date: 2019-10-20
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Open Hardware and Production
Description: 
	Chung Wei Tat

Pocket Science Lab is a complete platform that is fully open source in every layer; hardware and software. Looks may deceive you thinking it's another Arduino device but you would be amazed to see what it can do. This tiny device can literally replace a room full of electronic analytical tools with its 4 channel oscilloscope, logic analyzer, multimeter, wave generator and many more instruments it got. With a PSLab in hand, you wouldn't need to know any software programming to use and take readings from almost any sensor you got. PSLab got it all. In this session I am going to show you all of it.

all right okay so hi I'm Rita I'm from

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,509
Singapore so I'll be talking more of a

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,850
pocket science lab today so a little bit

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,020
info of what pocket science lab is about

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:26,160
it's actually a small do you know sighs

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:29,220
so what actually tries to simulate the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,859
RO science scientific instruments so I

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,989
will talk about what science treatments

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,550
you have that it actually supports after

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:41,670
this so yeah so a little bit history of

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,950
how pocket-sized science lab started so

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,050
initially it was called Sealab late' it

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,629
was actually quite bigger size maybe

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,079
about half the size of a laptop that was

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,550
the initial idea and then of course

00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,230
there was closed sauce so we tried to

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,329
actually open source a pocket science

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,120
lab that's where it came out with the

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,780
first hardware yes and then we created a

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,580
button that's not every pie cutie

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,170
because but then there's a lot of things

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,970
that's broken when from Python to

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,189
upgrade to Python tree so we actually

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,220
stopped that and we create a newer

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,020
version if electron now and then we

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,840
actually reduce the size of the pocket

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,150
science lab from that size to about the

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,880
credit card size Arduino sighs yeah and

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,890
we try to sell it on the portability so

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,890
that actually anyone can bring it

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,950
outside for learning activities just

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,590
puck it to a phone as OTG and yeah and

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,570
then we have a web app subsequently this

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,850
is a part of future roadmap which is

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,189
actually student planning yep so there's

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,170
a house it is the original a syllabus

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,439
this is quite zoom in size is the

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,250
original version then we have our

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,549
uniform move on this is actually double

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,920
sided this the cost of this is actually

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,899
higher than the current ones because

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,270
it's printed on both sides and then of

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:09,929
course this is the one that is the final

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:11,670
one so it's about this size I think so I

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,610
think I was just passing around y'all

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,940
want to have a look

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,100
have a look yep so did you actually

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,140
connect so their honor

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,300
yes PA two six six at the back so you

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,330
have a Wi-Fi support or you actually can

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,540
attach a Bluetooth module of hich c05

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,910
from the front and of course we keep the

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,380
programmer pots open so it's running on

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,150
picked a new phone so if let's say we

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,310
have a new firmware with more functions

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,680
we can actually just flash it with the

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,400
pic it and then you can have the new

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,500
functions so yes how do we use this so

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,810
you can use it trout desktop app or

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,070
Android app so initially the desktop app

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,290
was only on the Linux because it was

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,690
built on Python of course and then

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,550
subsequently we work with schools in

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,100
Singapore and they request most of them

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,080
are using Windows so then started to

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,760
think how how are you going to make the

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,660
desktop app multi-platform and that's

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,270
why we came up with electrons yes yeah

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,190
but anyway just roughly show you these

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,230
are some of the libraries that we have

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:19,209
the Python library is just a very basic

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:21,519
one it talks to the the board truth it

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,080
terminÃ³ with Linux awesome you know yeah

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,810
then we have desktop and enjoy it in

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,250
some way or these are open source even

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,220
the schematics of the open source as

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,750
well okay so this is how our Android

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,150
looks like this is actually older

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,590
version of the pocket science lab the

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,720
newer one doesn't looks like this the

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,480
pin slightly change you see this one

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,640
this actually has was the core

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,190
potentiometer that's actually to adjust

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,640
for volume and things like that so

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,440
anyway things have slightly changed now

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,810
okay so anyway this is like oscilloscope

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,610
and some power source you don't need

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,010
external power source to actually

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,470
powered port everything is just powered

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,959
sugar micro USB from a phone in that's

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,269
efficient and then we have multi meter

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,080
wave generate the the the basic few

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:11,140
instruments that you're always actually

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,600
using labs and then of course are we to

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,930
make a user user experience better we

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,579
actually on each instrument we did a

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,650
guide so you actually can just swipe out

00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,520
on the app and

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,860
see how do you actually use the yep and

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,510
we're to pluck it and things like that

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,090
and of course this is the new desktop

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,590
app you can see this clearly so it's

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,729
actually built if don't chase an

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:38,210
electron yeah so our focus it's actually

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,100
just on the base basic functions of

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,410
Android app just part over yet so we

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,880
have these are some of the ones and then

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,919
we recently actually came out of a

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,930
robotic arm control UI actually we

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,530
actually made PS lab to control some

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:59,070
arms previously at one of our hackathons

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,840
in Vietnam with parnership UNESCO okay

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:05,010
okay so this is some of the hardware

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,930
specs yeah I am more into a software

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,910
site but for those who are into how a

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,440
reactor you can't get this yeah of

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,810
course you can find these as well on our

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,160
github page or our website stock we

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:28,889
actually post it put it up there okay so

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:30,840
yeah some more waveforms PWM alright so

00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,880
we have four measurement so like you

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,240
have multimeters and stuff things like

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
that

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,470
of course one of the functions that we

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,210
build on now is actually recording so

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,060
Wow while you're actually taking reading

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:49,139
you actually could record the statistics

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,479
and export a CSV to gather the

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,669
coordinates so our ideas was actually to

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,000
make online platform for different

00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:58,740
people to actually share their data

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,270
let's say whether they died right so

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,430
sometimes some of the sources they say

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,639
official sources the data actually are

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,130
not as accurate let's say we just like

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,440
Bank off example right not bit of fact

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,479
so let's say they have this PS I've

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,599
meter in the middle of the city so that

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,570
reserved maybe of 80 psi but maybe this

00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:21,389
out of Bangkok could be much lower but

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,220
you are taking 80 psi so by having PS

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,310
lapsed from different people you

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,800
actually have more accurate data so

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,330
anyway this I was all responsible for

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
the production of PS left so I went to

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,910
China

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,240
yeah so this is the batch they are

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,030
passing around where's the pot now yeah

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,920
somewhere yeah so this I want to try and

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,140
produce of course there's many things on

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,510
a production if you want to ask me you

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,980
can ask me after that and yeah these are

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,900
some of the stuff of course there's more

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,720
yeah I think that the most important one

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,950
is actually the first line yeah there

00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,510
are some manufacturers who say it's very

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,200
cheap very cheap but they don't tell you

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:05,350
the condition of it yeah and then of

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,570
course we are working so I'm more very

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,970
responsible for Singapore operations ops

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,730
of course there's we do this in Vietnam

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,310
schools and some of the hackerspace in

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,170
Berlin as well so this is some of

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,600
activities here of course we'll be

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,220
conducting more work in schools to

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,930
understand their curriculum and how to

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:27,700
integrate this with their syllabus so

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,620
that you can actually use it to make

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,440
learning instead of just stuck in

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,080
classroom but can go and have more fun

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,650
yep of course this doesn't limits to

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,150
schools we actually uh there are some

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,640
hobbies or companies to actually

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,020
purchase some of the kids from us to

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,390
actually see whether they could

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,360
integrate it with their current company

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,280
solutions yeah so these are some of the

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,020
things how can involve because

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,910
everything's open so sometimes things

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,440
might get a little bit of slower or you

00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,130
have buggy things right I mean it's a

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,010
part and parcel open source so yeah so

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,440
yeah we are just lack of documentation

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,450
now of documentation meaning like

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,150
experiments on how to use the ports of

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,880
course we are working to that and we are

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,740
will be very happy if users who actually

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,050
have the PS lab BOTS could actually

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,490
country but what they do if the bots so

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,610
we could actually share the community as

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,820
well yeah we actually have a acrylic

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,820
casing coloured acrylic casing with

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,880
lines for cut a laser cutter outside if

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,670
you manage to catch it just now so we

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,280
actually did a design we've in scape as

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,860
well it's also on the github repo I mean

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,080
yeah if you want you've managed to

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,420
purchase a PSA if you want a credit case

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,600
you could actually just and finally

00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,840
the cutter to cut it out

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,850
on an acrylic yeah so these are coming

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,590
some of the places we we sell yep very

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,140
straightforward

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,730
okay so will be this is on some it makes

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,340
your faucet your some it you have this

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,220
every actually a Singapore there's

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,370
actually one the following week in

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,950
Vietnam actually it's a two-day one but

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,610
I think that's a much smaller this is a

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,670
bigger one

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,070
yeah so I think that's it for psi oh we

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,060
can be found on the snaps not a snap

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:31,790
store on Ubuntu go play and f-droid as

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:33,170
well yeah so yep any questions yes yes

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,340
okay so the electro name is a

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,640
cross-platform so you could actually

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,950
export electronic J's right is actually

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,450
you program it in JavaScript but you

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,760
actually could export it to Windows and

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,190
Mac as well but the base currently we

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,100
are working on heavily is actually

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,910
mainly on the Linux because with the

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,860
Python library yes for yes before it

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,900
should be able it will be able to run

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,460
with Linux and then Windows of course is

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:11,210
not very stable and things like that

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:12,920
when we export over was - I think I

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,570
should previous it - so - for four

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,570
channels yep

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,960
yes I mean of course our point is

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,550
actually keep this price point though

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:35,120
and this is about exciting 45 to 50 USD

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,920
currently of course these competitors in

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,770
the market I mean there's everything

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,450
that's competitors our main point is to

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,010
actually keep a price point low so

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,170
that's affordable

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,640
of course there's high specs much more

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,220
expensive or FPGA

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,280
things like that there are better specs

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,990
but yeah different if the first from

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,440
person to person what they wanted to

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,370
actually achieve yes of course

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,940
subsequently

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,490
we actually I think playing to do a next

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:09,740
production version of PS lab that

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:12,410
actually I think actually has more it

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,780
dive it goes to us a more biote devices

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,280
I would he device to actually put around

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,940
maybe without the phone just maybe a

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,980
battery pack or something to you have to

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,480
study down maybe one hour later one day

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,190
later I just come back and just collect

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:31,910
the data yeah oh yeah micro SD card yes

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,200
very yeah to start the data there's some

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,170
of the suggestions of course we are

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,920
looking at the costs and of course the

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:46,190
software side as well yeah any other

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:48,020
questions yeah I think if there's no

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:56,960
questions if you want to look at a poll

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:58,460
yeah no actually this is our own our own

00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,210
board so we have our own firmware and

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,240
things like that

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,220
yeah so it doesn't books with you know

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,550
yeah but we have the Python I reopened

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,550
so

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,620
I think I'm not very sure but I think

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,480
you might be possible it might be

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,200
possible to do that if the Python that

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,800
good yes

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:37,790
so of course yeah like I said we are

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,620
working schools I mean this way I mean

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,120
this is our balance consider this some

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,010
people's and some of them people say

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,730
this quite high specs for consider

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:49,670
considering it's 40 5 USD around a of

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,839
course to some people they want there

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,940
are professionals they want something

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,290
more powerful yeah of course that's why

00:12:52,940 --> 00:13:00,589
this more suited for schools or company

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,640
usage small usage IOT usage yeah data

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,279
collection yeah

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,200
and oh yeah nothing is it works with

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:11,779
arduino sensors which is i to see yeah

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,790
of course we have pins for digital

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,310
sensors as well but that one is a

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,630
thicker leader more bit more time it was

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,089
there's a lot of sensors in the market

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,740
and we have to actually have to make it

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:25,610
the digital sensor box with the former

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,230
as well yes there are some digital

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,420
sensors that should be already there

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,100
sure already work is in the settings of

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:35,449
the app you could actually choose the

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,100
external sensors which which sensor the

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:40,339
use from because for example we actually

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,110
have a let's say we have a instrument

00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:46,370
called lux meter they're actually taps

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:48,320
on the phones light sensor to ensure the

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,790
lux data well of course we give an

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,519
option of them to actually connect or

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:57,910
external locks sensor like like sensor

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,910
to read the data from it and record yes

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,970
anymore if you want to look at a board

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:11,540
we are at a faucet or poof outside so

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:17,860
yeah you can know it's already done

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,860
