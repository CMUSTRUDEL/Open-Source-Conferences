Description: 
	Nat Weerawan

Nat will be talking about the ups and downs of community-building; curation of tech content, connecting people, building teams out of volunteers from scratch, and the challenges of making the concept of ‘makers’ more known to society. Moreover, the talk will also touch upon how conventional education faces a challenge to build capabilities that correspond to fast-moving technological advances — mainly why building learning communities like Maker spaces is crucial.
