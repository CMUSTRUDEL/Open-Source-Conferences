	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,940
the next session is from open source by

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:14,700
all biological art to DIY scientific

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:18,210
instrument okay so mr. mark right yes

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,960
mr. mark sounds good okay okay give hand

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,560
please my my French name is a bit

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,710
difficult to pronounce so my real name

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,599
is mark DCA I'm stuck with a French name

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,369
because in I'm from Switzerland and

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,649
somehow it happens that some person from

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,320
Geneva gets married to a person from the

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,090
term and speaking part so I did not grow

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,210
up french-speaking it is correct mark

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,690
mark mark do say yeah is my family name

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,670
it's a very strange name there's a lot

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:55,489
of echo maybe we can put this a bit down

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:58,500
oh yeah exactly so I will talk about

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:00,930
bacteria that's a combination of hacking

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,239
and bacteria which is a project I have

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,129
been involved for exactly ten years we

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,380
have the anniversary and I show you a

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,150
bit also how all the projects have

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,040
influenced is from a local hacker

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,010
makerspace in Zurich that I'm involved

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,439
and I show some projects that happens in

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,360
the network around bacteria from a

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,360
friend called elapsed and from the

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,200
global open science hardware network and

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,250
I will talk a bit about cocoanuts

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,130
why do I know talk about coconuts I

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,750
don't know we will see maybe this has

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,100
something to do it so I run a company

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,100
called the Center for alternative

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,140
coconut research which some of you have

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,329
maybe shown some Ixia some example

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,369
outside but again I show a bit of

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,820
overview of different projects not only

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,340
from myself but I mostly talk about my

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,560
own personal opinion about these things

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,899
I'm not representing a larger group or

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,110
network with this I mentioned I'm from

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,350
Switzerland this is the least equipped

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,909
Fab Lab in the Swiss Fablab Network it's

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:09,750
officially a Fab Lab who knows fab labs

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:12,569
no one and these are shared shared

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,050
workshops for digital fabrication like

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,690
we have laser cutters

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:24,550
3d printers and suing machines or other

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:29,560
stuff with the idea yeah it's just a

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:32,760
nice place yeah no in fact it's so fab

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,770
labs our 3d printer it's manufacturing

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,960
but I do make some experiments with

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,080
bacteria and especially the yeasts it's

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,630
called brewing making wine or making

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,660
cheese so I'm from Switzerland but I

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,720
spend a lot of my time in Indonesia in

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,430
Taiwan and at the moment in Bangkok so

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,300
that's where the coconut topic came into

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,070
my life but for more than 10 years after

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,310
I finished a degree in like

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,990
nanotechnology and biosensors I started

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,370
to get more active in arts and culture

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,500
field in Switzerland

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,110
I'm interested in electronic music and

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,660
we have a community that really likes to

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,450
make their own synthesizers using also

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,360
open-source hardware also using open

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,880
source for like computer-generated music

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,980
and we have a whole community and we run

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,190
festivals around workshops and events

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,290
and this is somehow kind of radically

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,080
changed a bit my path away from academic

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,050
research into working with real people

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,959
in the public sphere and it's suddenly

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,200
after my high end activities on micro

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,770
fluidics and cell cell based sensors I

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,810
started to make this ultra simple

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,650
hardware that is a simple oscillator and

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:51,550
we got invited to India to Indonesia to

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,230
Taiwan to do this kind of maker to it

00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,590
yourself electronics workshops for

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,770
children and this was all nice suddenly

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,530
I'm kind of running around the world

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,150
soldering I invited to Taiwan to teach

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,950
them how to solder which was a bit

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,060
confusing because I thought that's where

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,920
all the hardware comes from but because

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,510
it's an art and Technology Network it's

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,109
also the process is very much about

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,280
creativity and an interdisciplinary

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,200
collaboration suddenly I work with

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,080
social workers with teachers with

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,169
designers freaks and so forth and I

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,510
really started to enjoy that and this is

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,000
still ongoing

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,960
not the focus of my talk but creating

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,400
creative printed circuit boards it's

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,500
also something I still do with this

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,480
company the scent of alternative coconut

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,880
research also this is a collaboration

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,700
with Indonesian and German partners it's

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,540
an open hardware platform to make 8-bit

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,940
music it looks like a cassette tape

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,460
8-bit is also from the 80s and it's also

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,970
a bit where I got kind of whatever

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,010
culturally trained I'm I'm 44 years old

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,500
already so my youth was spent and

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,530
spoiled in the 80s on Commodore 64

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,730
computers and I'm still reenacting them

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,530
with this kind of PCBs so it's open

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,330
hardware but it's also another creative

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,730
layer on top of it I'm happy to share

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,410
some of this outside but what I want to

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,940
talk about is how I started to merge my

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,850
training in nanotechnology and

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,950
biosensors with this newly found joy in

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,010
making things and do it yourself

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,140
I developed laboratory courses for

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,850
students with the goal that the students

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,000
have to build their own laboratory

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,310
equipment it was a nanotech class on

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,260
micro fluidics but my University where I

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,270
was teaching doesn't even have these

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,970
kind of laboratories available so we

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,060
used record players to make spin coders

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,460
we use some random UV lamps for certain

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,550
processes and we made some micro

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:58,980
fluidics and we made some XY stages

00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:01,410
using two dis or I think CD drives one

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,770
this way one this way to make a little

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,410
laser cutter that's to produce our

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,530
microfluidic devices so this started as

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,660
a student like project based learning

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,390
and it's also when we started to build

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:21,720
the first microscopes my hope was that

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,670
in this hybridity of making students DIY

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,220
and creatively that we could even work

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,340
with game designers and kind of come up

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,020
with games that use microorganisms use

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,640
these nano tech tools yeah and this

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,980
never really kicked off as an

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,410
international student competition but

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,370
this is a bit where I started to

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,240
introduce this

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,090
in my pedagogic approaches everything i

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,010
was based on open hardware this was also

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,570
the start of arduino and all that stuff

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,130
so I thought students have to learn this

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:59,160
this was in 2008 nine ten

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:03,630
so one thing that I really started to

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,520
embrace also in open hardware is that

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,979
it's do it yourself as a pedagogic

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,650
approach but it's also do it with others

00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,090
do it with others means on partially it

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,090
means collaborative teams

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,550
it also means others people that have a

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,830
different background people that have a

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,560
different skin color people that are not

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:27,360
even people maybe the other is a plant

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,910
also hopefully make something useful but

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,169
not too much it's good enough if it's

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:37,440
good enough or funny and maybe also

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,090
create something using beautiful so

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,880
there is also something else written

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,100
there it's called hack the planet when I

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,139
say hacking I think in these circles you

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,080
kind of know it I do not mean brick

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,289
breaking into security systems but I

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,240
also do not mean making there is a

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,190
difference between making something and

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,110
hacking something and here we see the

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,530
symbol of the maker movement the hot

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,020
glue gun but a hacker opens it up look

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,400
what's inside and maybe finds a new use

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,220
of it so this creative insight and kind

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,099
of repurposing of something is when I

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,430
talk about hacking and so ten years ago

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:21,000
we started a website called a curator

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,380
org introducing artists and creatives

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,210
into methodologies to do biology

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,220
laboratory biology field biology and

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,660
stuff like this so similar to what I

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,390
showed you before in electronics we

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,120
wanted to apply on on biological

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,940
laboratory methods on genetics on

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,520
working with bacteria and so forth and

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,500
you know this was still in the 2008 9

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,410
when wiki's were really cool before

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,950
Facebook got big so we install the wiki

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,990
and we call it a project and the first

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,240
project that we developed as a workshop

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,390
that I think integrates this is an

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,120
instruction

00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,180
build a microscope the most fundamental

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,880
tool for let's say science in many

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,770
different fields it extends your view to

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,380
the small things that our eye cannot see

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,810
anymore but we use a webcam a really

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,950
cheap one a consumer product for three

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:18,220
dollars and weari we place the position

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:21,550
of the optics of the lens to turn it

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,890
into a microscope and you have to just

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,200
have some way of holding your sample and

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,850
putting the light and this is also a

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,520
creative process to let people

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,100
experiment with building the setup to

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,490
turn this into a microscope you have to

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,600
really precisely be able to position

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,880
your sample so small hands help and you

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,120
can use it and you see microscopic life

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,430
that you have never ever seen before

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,940
anybody knows this it's written yeah

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:55,740
it's a tardigrade a water bear it's also

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,570
the mascot and the logo of our project

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,390
you see individual cells from your

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,110
tongue or from like from the inside of

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,140
your body

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,970
you see yeast cells blood cells and

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,240
stuff like that it's not a high quality

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,250
but still it's like a whoa and it's a

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,220
hack because we use a system that was

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:23,320
meant to Skype with your grandma to look

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:25,390
at your sperm and because of this DIY

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,160
workshops it got really popular I got

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,130
invited to many places in the world we

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,720
just had to talk about Maps how was it

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:36,970
this is not OpenStreetMap what's wrong

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:41,530
with the map no who said what is up and

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:45,030
down it's not I can reread Russian

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:47,410
Federation it's correct Mongolia

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:51,520
Indonesia in the centre of the world or

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,050
Thailand yeah so having this

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,540
opportunities to work in this other

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,210
place it's made me also rethink how I

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,250
looked at the world and as Europeans

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,630
were really spoiled we really think

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,060
we're the center of the world the

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,950
Mercator projection puts like Germany in

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,140
the center but maybe we're just this

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:12,580
little half island DP

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,860
Asia I don't know so I had opportunities

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,690
to collaborate with a lot of Indonesian

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,910
kind of collectives that also work on

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,400
this art and technology interface we

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,010
like to make synthesizes together we

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,890
like to make wine together and it's the

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,560
first time I saw this open-source

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,630
chocolate I did not know how chocolate

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,400
was produced just to let you know I did

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,650
not know that the fruit looks like this

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,500
and I thought we know about chocolate in

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,180
Switzerland putting the microscopy

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,600
project in this context of teaching

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:46,060
students was a very joyful experience

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,720
it's really something useful we can also

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,850
modify existing equipment with a webcam

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,210
to create digital images instead of just

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,840
looking with your eye but then also I

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:01,750
saw a lot of Arduino projects in the

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,020
West in Europe they make like a low-cost

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,650
something temperature controller Arduino

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:11,500
25 sensor from out of roots ten dollars

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:14,290
and so forth the local innovators

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,300
already sell an incubator for five

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,250
dollars in this store or I think it's a

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,920
hundred thousand rupiah stat seven

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,680
dollars and this comes with a thermal

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,590
controller a lamp to heat it this is to

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,390
breed eggs at home if you have chicken

00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,520
so a lot of the projects we see as low

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,290
cost in Europe in fact are not low cost

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,120
that considered expensive I figured out

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,840
and in fact maybe they're already

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,180
available also I figured out we don't

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,100
have to build these high-tech tools for

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,560
the basic stuff that maybe a farmer

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,290
really wants to know is has the

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,510
temperature of his kako fermentation

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:53,020
been consistent over the last two days

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,990
or has debian power cut if so he maybe

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,420
has to drop depta batch if not he can

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,400
sell it twice the price to the next

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,770
seller so it's not even about

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,330
controlling temperature just being aware

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,850
that you had a consistent temperature

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,640
seems to be the topics the local farmers

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,640
and my agricultural microbiology student

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,540
friends are interested which is trivial

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,460
if you have a 101 arduino class this is

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,709
what you do in the first lesson but it

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:25,370
has its input importance

00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:28,100
so on one hand we have application on

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:31,220
the other hand we have education and I

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,639
have been thinking a lot on like should

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,290
I sell it as a product this microscope

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,050
but then people think I don't have the

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,269
product I cannot do microscopy and the

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,430
idea of open source and instruction

00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,509
should be that the other person takes

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,370
your knowledge adapts it to his own

00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:51,649
environment maybe even changes it

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,629
improves it and I do think of it then

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:57,110
when we start selling these open-source

00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,879
hardware as a kit we maybe even lose

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,860
something so I was really thinking we

00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,870
have to open-source the instruction

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,449
primarily leave it but as open as

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,759
possible that the person understands he

00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:10,220
can do whatever he wants with it but it

00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,220
doesn't work um I gave this presentation

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,339
about the microscope many times and then

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,879
afterwards there's a group discussion

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:21,740
are we allowed to copy that and when I

00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,740
say open source hundred times but in

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,189
these circles we know but very often we

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,610
have this idea of the the innovator owns

00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:34,459
the project and even patents are not

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,889
meant that you own that project patents

00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:41,389
are also meant to spread it it got bad

00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:43,459
but somehow yeah on the other hand this

00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,430
picture made is really famous huh

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,889
so this is a lot of laboratory equipment

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:52,160
that we build using recycled hardware

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,110
laser cutters it has predefined files

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,449
but people think they need a laser

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,329
cutter to build it but in fact you don't

00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:01,370
most of it is just cases around a piece

00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:06,860
of hardware and you can build the case

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:09,379
with the hand also so what personally my

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,420
interest is in this open source science

00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:14,059
hardware is mostly educational and

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,100
having people understand what's inside

00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,740
of this equipment that you use on a

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,269
daily basis as a way of learning as a

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,579
way of being creative and also as an

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,649
aesthetic output you see how they all

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,110
look different this is the microscope on

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:33,529
top there's one on the bottom and so

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,640
forth and what I wanted to say again

00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,070
about this innovate

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,170
there is mom at the moment everybody has

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,899
to be an innovator if I show you my

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,680
innovation she said I cannot do it

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,750
anymore

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,940
someone else already did it and I think

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,730
the true value of open-source hardware

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,800
is that to use other people's open

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,890
hardware and make something with it and

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,720
we should value that translation in a

00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,180
way because you will always change it to

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,820
your local needs you will change it to

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,370
your local markets you maybe make a

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,019
business with it and even translating an

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,810
instruction from English into Thai

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,519
creates more value than sitting there

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,910
and coming up with an innovation and

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,200
then pretending something that's new

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,480
ignoring all the people's credit and so

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,279
forth so I think we should value more in

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,820
the open hardware environments the

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,940
translation the add up add to operations

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,160
I don't know maybe adaptation and the

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,720
implementation of projects the

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,149
microscope project I think every school

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,800
in the world should do it but we should

00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,899
value that person that goes to the

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,640
school and not the person that makes a

00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,870
new Kickstarter with the same crap we

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,120
have seen hundred times the goat is

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:47,180
blown up so to do so we just have a wiki

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,720
for 10 years it's a mess you will never

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,870
find anything take your time or ask

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,390
people we also have a forum where you

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,540
can kind of ask questions it's forum

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:02,149
detective rhetoric and anyway on the

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,309
main website you find the links and

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,290
today I mostly focus on this laboratory

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,390
equipment like you see here I already

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,669
showed you a bit you know from the

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:15,890
microscope story how he can get take

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:17,750
different paths and how this image was

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,569
so popular because it looks like real

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,579
science which is purely an aesthetic

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:27,439
decision by the way a good photographer

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,370
and byte at other equipment that we have

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,970
built over the years

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:34,460
and here I personally I like to office

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,730
ly show this measurement concepts it's

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,460
an Arduino on top of it we have a laser

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,380
that goes through some kind of a sample

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,990
and most probably you have a light

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,570
sensor here also these are like Arduino

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,850
class one like skills for

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,490
we're in software but this is a very

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,559
fundamental measurement to see how much

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,480
light goes through a sample even at a

00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,789
specific wavelength in this case red

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,710
this tells us the chemistry this tells

00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:03,899
us how many particles are in there and

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,840
if we combine it with some other

00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:09,960
reagents and we can do proper water

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,870
analysis and one issue we have with all

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:17,519
this open science hardware is the

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:19,889
software is easy to copy hardware not so

00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,850
you still have to make it order it and

00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:23,909
assemble it

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,279
but the wetware the reagents the

00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:30,330
molecules the cells they're extremely

00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:33,559
difficult to open source and quite often

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:36,809
you see a paper open source something's

00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,850
detector but in fact only the hardware

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,710
and the software is open source and the

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,590
reagents you need the chemicals are

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,620
heavily protected patented and expensive

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,779
so when we talk assist in an open source

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,870
system we have to combine also like

00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:54,929
access to the molecules and the cells to

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,659
do this experiments I call it turbidity

00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:00,330
meter in this case how turbid is the

00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:02,820
water which means how much particles are

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,039
absorbing the light I made an

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,889
educational board where people prototype

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,049
their own spectrophotometer

00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:12,090
it measures absorption of light at a

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,370
specific wavelength through a specific

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,960
path within our tiny people can

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,490
prototype with light Sanders and then I

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,190
have to build up something that's

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,649
reproducible so the measurement from his

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,320
from him can be compared to the

00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:27,179
measurement from her and so they have to

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,909
come up with preferred usability of the

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,250
setup and if it's an optical setup don't

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,350
just put it like this in the air build a

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,409
black box around it so sometimes black

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:40,559
boxes are good when we build optical

00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,570
devices so we have also a 3d printed

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,279
version and that's even more advanced

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,090
and of course it turns out to be a black

00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:50,580
box that's what you have to make inside

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,889
is a webcam and something that's called

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,230
a grating which is similar to a Prisma

00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:58,409
it spreads the light into the different

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,940
wavelengths it creates rainbows because

00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:02,420
it's a webcam we can only see the

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,300
visible light so what we can see is

00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,100
kind of colors are in our sample and

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,030
everything is connected with an optical

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,540
fiber so they go from this rough

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,130
prototypes to also let's say finish it

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:21,850
up repository that can be easily

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:24,020
reproduced another example is the PCR

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,850
PCR thermal cycler

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,910
this is a very standard method for

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:32,180
genetic analysis to see the presence of

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,580
a certain sequence of DNA again the

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,090
reagents are difficult to get but the

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,430
way we can see them is by heating it up

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,910
to 9 degrees cooling it down to 60

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,620
degrees heating it up to 90 degrees

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,720
cooling it down to 60 degrees and so

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,730
forth this is a trivial task for any

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,130
engineer or any cook took

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,840
so technically these are very simple

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,970
things to build and this is a hair dryer

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,010
that we hacked to go through these

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,250
temperature profiles with an Arduino or

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:08,600
something and the more advanced version

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:12,290
is a fully manufacturable like pico or

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,950
pocket pcr where even the heat the heat

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,960
element here is using PCB manufacturing

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,410
which is a very accessible method of

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,140
fabrication and yeah it runs 5 samples

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:28,490
it's still in process there's a

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,980
prototype outside and it seems to work I

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,800
mentioned briefly already this XY

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,220
scanner that we used for liquid handling

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,870
so we put a syringe on the left side you

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,340
see a syringe that we move with the

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:45,560
motor from a floppy drive we have 2 XY

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:48,650
DVD drives to move around the end of the

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,350
tube so we have a liquid handling robot

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,950
a bit like a 3d printer but kind of we

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,930
don't print 3d we just put drops of

00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,560
bacteria or other molecules on the

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:04,460
surface this has led to more advanced

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,520
project in laboratory automation a lot

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,450
of the biology laboratory experiments

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,070
are handling liquids mixing them moving

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,620
them and so forth

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,450
so open drop I also have one outside is

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,830
one

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,690
community-developed project where we

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:24,769
have this is how our meetings sometimes

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,659
look like sometimes like up there where

00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:29,059
we collaboratively come up with ideas

00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,710
and this and that so open drop moves

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,130
around liquids it's best to show it

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,130
moving

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:53,150
so in this example you did not want the

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:56,059
green dots to meet the blue dot as a

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:58,820
game but of course in a real laboratory

00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:01,460
experiment you might want to mix two

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,409
liquids this mix release to some

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,690
reaction may be a color change and this

00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:08,630
gives me some insight in presence of

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,700
arsenic or food poisoning or certain

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,400
bacteria and so forth there's a little

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,520
hole so we can even look through these

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,770
samples with the spectrometers and yeah

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,260
and so a lot of this project they span

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:25,720
from very educational rough prototypes

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:29,270
to more perfectly engineered prototypes

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,730
a lot of the work has also been done by

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,890
my good friend and also partner Caldwell

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:38,149
scout ends with the logo up there Gaudi

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:41,899
labs and currently they're working on an

00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:44,390
even stranger project it's recycling old

00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:46,789
scientific hardware what you see there

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,039
is a DNA sequencer to measure the full

00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:51,890
DNA sequence of a human the machine

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,049
costs about 1 million and it's being

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,760
thrown away because it's the first

00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:59,029
generation it's not supported anymore

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,950
it's too expensive to run so all the big

00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:03,200
companies and research labs don't use

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,299
them anymore but of course it's closed

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,460
source software so if you want to use a

00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:09,169
new application or program a new

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,360
application just using the microscope

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:13,789
and lasers that are in there my friends

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,399
are now working on an open-source kind

00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:18,409
of API or something I'm not a software

00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:22,820
guy so other people can find new

00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:24,700
application of recycled hardware but I

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,529
want to finish with just like

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,049
announcement so with AK tyria and many

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:31,669
other groups like public lab some

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:33,919
research laboratories that work on

00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:37,820
similar projects we have started the

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:42,260
global open science hardware movement we

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:45,140
had a first meeting in 2016 at CERN this

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,630
Luc's sounds really cool while CERN but

00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,399
CERN does rent venues for public events

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,110
so they were not really involved but

00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:53,440
just putting it there in the title of

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:57,530
course gives you a publication in nature

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,340
when I say open science I don't mean

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,309
access

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,890
to science I mean a very much holistic

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:06,799
inclusive way to do science including

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:09,049
society including diversity in science

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,840
includes also including other knowledge

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,929
productions of science indigenous

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,940
knowledge chance and stuff like this and

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:20,299
I think many people share it is in that

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,400
network compared to the open hardware

00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:26,059
networks it's specifically about open

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,610
science hardware to enable open science

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:30,860
and we did another event in Chile and

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,559
last year we did an event in Shenzhen

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,630
and we have a forum where we can discuss

00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,279
these projects with four or five hundred

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,039
people on it at the moment

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,649
it has already spawned local initiatives

00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,799
and we want to as a network now not

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:48,080
organize another global event but

00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,270
inspire people to do local initiatives

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,850
this is also why I am here by the way we

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,320
work together with Foss Asia for the

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,149
last event a few people came and

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,250
vice-versa I had to show my face here

00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:03,740
open science is here to stay that's

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,169
really something everybody says there is

00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,090
groups in Cameroon there is big European

00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:11,299
initiatives that this is the way we're

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:14,000
gonna do it sadly it's not there yet

00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:17,179
you mentioned this already a pro pedia

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,090
is another good source it's huge it's

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:22,039
much more about then open source lab

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:24,350
there's also how to make a dry toilet

00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,120
and generally appropriate technology but

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:29,570
some people have digged out their own

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,299
little zone about 3d printed laboratory

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,870
equipment with a lot of links on it yeah

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:39,630
thanks that's all

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,630
