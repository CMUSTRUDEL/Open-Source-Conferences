Publication date: 2019-10-20
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Open Hardware and Production
Description: 
	Khomdet Phueadphut 

KBIDE is a tool for embedded board development [types esp32 and arduino-avr]. Its coolest feature allows beginners to learn programming using blocks without having to worry about complicated syntax. Moreover, more elaborate users can also choose to code with C/CPP Language to unlock its full potential. Other key features include efficient compulation, ease of plug-in use, and customizable IDE. But what is the logic behind building this user-friendly tool? All its workings is backed with Electron and VueJS, a Compiler coded by NodeJS, developed as a WebApp - all-in-all which makes it an ease for all users. Not to mention that this amazing tool is 100% Open-source.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
let's start up the deck a bi da I think

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,480
most of most of people in this room may

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,820
be experienced in the arduino ide before

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,370
right recording we had a seek

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,369
maybe someone has been experienced in

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,800
make hold an arc with a micro bit use

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,810
the something hard to visualize we're

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,539
gambling by drag and drop something like

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,150
that and put everything together without

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,380
a coding without the syntax something

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,320
like that so the concept of the que pide

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,010
is combining everything together come by

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,230
with the Arduino IDE and combined with

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,230
the make horde something like that

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,690
together with the one ID because we have

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,960
the concept pump of three main parts the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,300
first one is everyone can use this idea

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,629
to develop some some hardware thing

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,180
something like that if you don't know

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,780
everything something like a hardware

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,239
something like a cording with a seahorse

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,100
you begin there after programming you

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,260
can use the the block will come into

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,909
some around something and if you are an

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,210
expert you can switch back to the

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:21,030
seahorse writing see caught with the

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:25,259
compact part of the program the second

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,890
one is Hannibal the user of this IDE

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,979
have have three free to group first one

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,100
is the normal user like a pro camera the

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,680
second is developer try to put something

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,490
into the the ID and the last one is the

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:47,100
market and yeah that's it let go to the

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:53,670
flop demo because I think it went

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:59,759
getting time ok you can see here is a kb

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:03,390
ide yeah it isn't a first one download

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:10,789
from the website in here if you can see

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,789
ok let me close the presentation

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:19,739
okay you can see here put the KB KB IDE

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,530
that up you can see the the every Vita

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,859
you seen in this idea for example you

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,159
can copy the pro programming in this you

00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:31,439
can use the text programming in this and

00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,650
you can download and every feature in

00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,469
here this fly in here but I'm gonna show

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:44,159
you how to use the real program in here

00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:47,370
yeah if you open the IDE something like

00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:52,709
this the first one you need to select

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:58,799
your job or in here we have something

00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:02,370
called the bot manager if you are want

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:05,310
to program it to the arduino you know

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:12,299
you can select this and just change the

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:15,030
board in in here and that's it the IDE

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:19,979
will change into the interface in the

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,290
Arduino you can set pin digit on with

00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,379
digit on rye and a lock with an outright

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,870
you can do with the time by delaying

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:32,280
something you can create worry about do

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:36,599
the map thing compare with the logic or

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,019
even use the add one like a function joy

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:44,879
some text and write everything on the

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:50,939
serial monitor but if you want to use

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:53,400
article like a ESP 32 you can select one

00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:57,329
up here are even the whole load from the

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,969
online in here yeah we have a lot of

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,250
board in the online you don't need to

00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:05,699
use every board but you can select your

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,060
board for example I I will I have this

00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:17,909
one on my hand I just quick on the

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:20,090
download and yeah wait for it a bit come

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,090
on

00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:26,870
yep it

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,650
are you download and unzip to my my

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,710
current work spare and we got here is a

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,350
TT GOG wash you can select in here after

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,070
that we sharing the burden to the that

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,950
she want

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,350
yeah this function of this board you can

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:47,150
prayer with the axle with the power

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:51,400
management the clock in this board and

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:55,340
also you have an f1 function like a

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,280
connect with the Wi-Fi connect with the

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,290
Bluetooth right guitar or connect to the

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,950
MQTT something like that it's a feature

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:07,700
of this this board when it is you can

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:11,090
you can download on the online same and

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,550
the plug-in manager is the same thing

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,780
like if you want to connect your part

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,350
with the some sense for example in the

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:25,580
the temperature sensor the s-1 egg be

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:33,050
sick o in here you can select by just

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:37,070
download in here after that you click on

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:40,880
the plug-in and already yeah in here why

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:46,010
what does install in one click now if

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,690
you want to connect the I secrecy LCD

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,360
Sun up something like that you can

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,600
download from here we have a lot of

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,560
cracking in here with the block

00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,460
programming already yeah you got the I

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:05,840
square C LCD in here we have yeah a lot

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,840
of options so that means if you want to

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,020
show something on the screen you you

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,280
just drag and drop and pin take

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,790
something like that in here is that's it

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:23,930
it's very easy and convenient also we

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:28,940
have the the example and tutorial in

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:31,940
here you can see the like I dunno right

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,660
we have to add some oh you can select

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,240
same for example if you don't know how

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,700
to use the des sensor library some

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,870
something like that you can open the

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:49,220
example anterior and open the example of

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:56,960
the block or on the see hole in here

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:59,360
this is example we can use easily the

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:05,930
last thing it's a set thing you can

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:09,170
choose your favorite colors open the

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,570
developer mode for upload something like

00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,520
if you have your own board and you have

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:20,230
some something you can put back to the

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:25,550
the original Reaper's level story okay

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:29,150
we have Brock becoming right but more

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,940
than that if you're an expert want to

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,850
write something special something as one

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,060
from the block cannot do you can switch

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:42,230
you the text for coming book mode in C

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:48,130
hole in here yeah in C host you can

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,130
write your Arduino program some people

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:57,740
open and do something e that in the Z is

00:07:52,210 --> 00:08:00,590
Z and indeed see hold you can like a

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:07,250
convert from the original block for

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:10,310
example we connect the bring bring the

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:15,500
LCD in here if you sue it back into the

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:19,040
see whole it original but if we convert

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:24,169
from the block you can't a caught your

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,600
driving the LCD screen in here that mean

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,160
if you're an expert you don't need right

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,160
everything you just drag-and-drop

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,010
there's something first and convert

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:41,800
those brought in to the seeker and do

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:41,800
another thing in the Z whole letter okay

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,740
altered unless we have a serial monitor

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,550
in here

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:54,110
like as idioma how do we know we can see

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:58,190
the text in here or you can use the

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:02,440
cough mode to show like a graphing part

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:08,720
everything into the graph on this IDE

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:11,300
okay this part is a like a normal

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,400
Arduino you you can select the comfort

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:21,620
and and above it to programming

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:24,080
something okay in the block the final

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:33,140
image is the the do or more do more like

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:36,260
it you can in here you can see the the

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,720
code in the that the right side it

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,350
cannot eat it but it will show directly

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,830
if you put in this block LCD screen

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:49,910
right you can see the interactive is we

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:53,090
show in the sinkhole right if you put in

00:09:49,910 --> 00:10:02,060
this set up it will show in the set up

00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:04,840
if you write something like a prayer is

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,080
will show you directly

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,080
[Music]

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,759
so let me demo some some this board this

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:24,120
work harder to keep bribe on keep I part

00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,860
from the government in here so you can

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:39,209
easily write a song something like a

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:48,809
prayer note okay in here and pray that

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:51,749
think about not after that I connect at

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:58,620
the bar to to my PC now I think it's a

00:10:51,749 --> 00:11:01,170
common number number 5 number fine ok we

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:08,910
kind of upload to there to that a song

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:17,300
to this board you know I think it's from

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:17,300
nabo fine is is not right component okay

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,620
number seven

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,160
in the comp I'd harm if you come here

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:43,490
with our you know he's gained more about

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:46,970
60% of the disappeared up you can see

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,550
here the comparison with with the the I

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,470
dunno idea even with the kbit because we

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:59,540
have a lot of through programming in the

00:11:51,470 --> 00:12:02,930
breakdow yeah that's it you took drag

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,460
the block culture in this and if he

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,070
quitting here you can see the art in

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:14,000
note you can edit in here you can remove

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:16,640
some node and add your own song yeah we

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,370
also have a lot of block like it draw

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,580
some picture on on the screen if you

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:26,029
have I Square see you don't need to like

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:35,470
a impart the picture no you can you just

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:35,470
a simple like for except it is born okay

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:45,910
okay let me close I'm gonna switch you

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,910
to block book anymore okay

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,190
like if you want to draw something on

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:59,420
the screen you don't need to convert the

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:05,170
picture because you can select the the

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:08,269
bar something like it and use the like

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,440
this play on the screen right on the

00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,110
screen and that's it

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:19,850
the picture will we show up on the

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:23,389
screen think ok on the background on the

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,209
background I think it is a lot of it you

00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:30,470
can open the KBI detour ort and and

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:33,670
browse more information on that but in

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:37,519
the black camp art like yeah in the

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:40,310
technology we hi of this IDE we use the

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:46,399
beauteous is the main framework that we

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:49,639
use and the beautify is uh like a UI or

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,100
the button everything is a beautifying

00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,899
and we use the web pack to pack

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,269
everything together and run on the

00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:02,949
browser everything you see here is the

00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:08,089
browser is a browser but it has like a

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:10,399
runtime in ojs in here is his website so

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,360
that mean if we bring on a website you

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:20,899
can run under the MacBook under Linux on

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,699
the window it is cause has formed and we

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:25,250
used the blockly from the cooker to

00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:30,440
driving the the block programming and we

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:33,410
use Monaco same at the the vs col vs was

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,569

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,740
the theme of the programming

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:12,810
yeah that's it he's a heavy IDE for more

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:17,100
information is uh a lot of desire about

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:20,310

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,480
comprise them it really coming here but

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:37,020
if you are developer is really easy to
