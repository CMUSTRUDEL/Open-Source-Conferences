Description: 
	Cristian Guajardo

In the last decades, chemical analysis has been moving from the laboratory to hand-held devices, of which the glucose meter (for diabetes pacients) and pregnancy test are two successful examples. Paper-based microfluidics is a new technology that holds the promise of removing expensive and cumbersome instrumentation from chemical analysis devices, while still performing sophisticated medical and agricultural diagnostics. These devices are commonly fabricated using paper containing fluid channels made out of wax, which conduct the liquid sample during the analysis. In this talk, we tell our experience of adopting free and open source technology to modify an existing design of wax printer, and to use it as an student project for our laboratory.

well so my name is Christian well many

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:10,650
people has problems with with my surname

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,440
here my surname is guajardo so if you

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,750
find a Spanish surname with with je here

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,869
it sounds like more or less when you are

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:24,510
sick like so is well well I am

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,060
researcher from this University but but

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,480
not in this campus I'm a researcher in

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,550
Mancunian campus and it's pretty

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,550
exciting time for me this time because

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,800
it's the first time we we do all we work

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,500
actually with an an open source project

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,739
actually based on an open source project

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,200
that is existing now and so will I will

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,719
show with you and share with you my

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,280
experience and experience of my students

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,350
with this project so as you see here it

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,660
is building a wax printer

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,260
well actually we took a 3d printer and

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,480
we turn it into our explint and for

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,659
using it in the lab I work in sensor

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,150
technology laboratory and we fabricate

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,960
prototypes of scent sensors and develop

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,700
sensors so mostly what we do is chemical

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,060
analysis and and this is the printer

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,479
form is for fabricating this kind of

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:25,310
devices for chemical analysis so today I

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,810
will talk about mostly two things one

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,000
probably many of you don't don't know

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,150
about chemical analysis so I will give a

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,060
short motivation of for chemical

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,970
analysis the current technology that you

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,439
may have seen in the market the the new

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,210
technology that is not in the market

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,299
that that we are working in the research

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,549
and how to build this technology this

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,220
technology is is called paper based

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,159
micro fluidics and mostly for

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,920
fabricating these we need works printers

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,979
so that's why your project and then why

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,469
wait to build the wax printer and then

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,180
we go into some some details of the

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,869
projects that we deal with our students

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,000
and then some final words regarding l

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,379
like open source and and our experience

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,740
so this is more or less with you what

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,220
you can

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,980
fine now in the market and chemical

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,380
analysis normally was welding still now

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,560
but more in the past was done mostly in

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:31,380
the labs but from time some some some

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:34,350
years ago this analysis these tests have

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,240
been moving from the lab to devices that

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,720
that you can you can buy in the pharmacy

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,400
or do that you can hold it in your hand

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,910
for example these three are the three

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,360
most most famous probably the first one

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,750
is a urine test the second is the

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,340
pregnancy test and the third is a

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,160
glucose sensor for patients with

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,050
diabetes so in this one if you have a

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,210
sample of urine instead of sending to

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,970
the lab to analyze you just buy this

00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:05,760
strip you put your sample of urine here

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,340
and it will flow and when it flows it

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,460
will change colors here each each of

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,370
these squares measures one one component

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,430
let's say of the urine and depending on

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,190
the intensity of the color then you will

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,440
know whether you have more or less of

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,870
one of these components in urine for

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,090
example albumin or glucose or protein

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:32,730
whatever yeah another one that is

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,300
probably most common is the pregnancy

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,090
test here the woman pulls a sample in

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,970
the in the pregnancy test and if it

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,560
appears this this bar here then it means

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,810
that she is pregnant if it doesn't

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,970
appear it means that she's not and it

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,970
measures some proteins that are present

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,340
in the body of the woman this one as I

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,370
told you before is for the patients with

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,960
diabetes this one is not as simple as

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,390
this two because it requires an

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,880
electronic component which delivers the

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,850
the resulting numbers how much glucose

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,950
you have in your in your blood and the

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,140
way it works is just to put a sample of

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,940
blood here and and it tells you how much

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,770
blue a viewer you have in your blood so

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,109
this three kind of devices are quite

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,229
simple in general because the sample

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:24,270
that you put in these devices either

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:27,570
stays still like in this case in the

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,390
sensor or moves only in one day

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,310
and the detection is pretty

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,950
straightforward you just put the sample

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,680
there and immediately you measure the

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:41,160
the concentration of the analyte that

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,470
that you you are interested in these

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,620
kind of devices they they don't perform

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,770
analysis in in several steps they just

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,010
do it in one step so complex analytes

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,990
that require let's say filtration or

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,710
pre-processing before measurement you

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:03,050
can not do it with with them so this is

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,250
where the new technology comes so

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,990
difference from this one with the

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,050
previous well the name of this

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,530
technology is called a paper-based micro

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,390
fluidics well this technology allows you

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,080
in difference with the previous one that

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:21,210
the flow here is not not linear it how

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,760
or the liquid doesn't stay still in a

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,400
single spot you can direct the flow of

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,190
liquid in your device to different

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,290
stages where each each stage of the

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:37,680
device perform different steps in

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:42,360
complete analysis or test of some

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:47,280
sampling of the protein or molecule in

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,590
your samples so in this way the sample

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,010
can can follow very intricate patterns

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:56,520
to go from stage to stage and the way to

00:05:53,010 --> 00:06:00,030
detect the liquid in these devices is by

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,970
using channels and these channels flow

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,260
in paper in defined directions because

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,360
these these these channels are made from

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,610
from a hydrophobic barrier yeah it means

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,740
a barrier that doesn't let water or

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,450
liquid go out a one simple material for

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,700
fabricating these barriers is wax

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,710
because wax is hydrophobic and it won't

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,100
let the liquid go out from from the

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,140
tracks that you define so for example in

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,860
this case the sample doesn't flow

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:34,710
linearly this one detects a glucose in

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,080
blood as well and in difference with the

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,330
previous one this one is is optic not is

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,070
not electronic so you put the sample

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,320
here in the middle

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,350
in the middle it has a lot of antibodies

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,560
that are gluten it the red blood cells

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,900
so you can somehow separate the plasma

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,600
from the big bodies of the blood and

00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:00,030
then the plasma goes to each of these

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,910
ends of the device where it has a

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,070
control signal and it has the signal of

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,690
your measurement in triplicate which is

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,690
different from the previous one in the

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:13,500
previous one this electronic version

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,790
only gives you one measurement but this

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,890
one gives you the measurement in

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:21,690
triplicate so you can make sure the the

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,960
measurement is is more accurate well

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,450
visually it can give you a an estimate

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,600
of the amount of glucose that you have

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,090
employed but if you want something more

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,640
quantitative like with a specific number

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,100
the people couple these things with

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,650
mobiles everyone nowadays almost

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,200
everyone has mobiles and you can analyze

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,090
the intensity of the color by using

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,970
applications on the mobile and that will

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,520
give you a number of how much glucose

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,650
you have in your body this is more or

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,460
less the kind of intricate patterns that

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:59,160
that the fluid can can follow within the

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,760
device this device is printed in a sheet

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,970
of paper yeah but this cheat of paper

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:09,390
with these nine squares can be folded

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:12,300
yeah so the sample comes and passes

00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:15,240
through each of these well following the

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,340
arrows here it it passes through each of

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,800
these different squares and in each of

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,080
these different squares and they they

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,020
perform different stages of the process

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,930
of analyzes of the of the sample that

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,840
you want to measure this one also

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,120
detects glucose and an protein in in

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,300
urine it's much more complex than the

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,380
previous one and this one also it

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:44,490
detects a nitrate in water yeah that may

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:49,560
be dangerous and this one detects in in

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:53,190
a sevenfold so each of these circles

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,520
here very likely allows a detection of

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,209
nitrate

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,779
in different ranges yeah so it can span

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:03,970
a wider range for detection and also the

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:06,610
the color here indicates the intensity

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,010
of the of the analyte nitrate and you

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:17,170
can make it quantitative by using

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:19,810
Mobile's so for this we need wax to

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,730
fabricate this kind of devices and how

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,620
how they are fabricated actually the

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,020
process is very simple that's why people

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,180
researchers are moving to this platform

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,000
and experimenting with this technology

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,709
of paper-based microfluidics so what do

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,860
we do we just draw a pattern in the

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:38,770
computer and later comes the magic here

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,839
we paint it with a wax printer there are

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,790
commercial wax printers where you can

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,029
print these patterns and after printing

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:49,870
the pattern will be printed on top of

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:53,830
the surface of paper so in order to let

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,350
the liquid flow the direction specified

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,079
by the wax patterns you need to reflow

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,390
this wax so how do you do that you melt

00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,060
it in an oven or in a hot plate so the

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,060
wax enters the paper and defines the

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,740
channels inside the paper yeah this is

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,600
very simple and the process of

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:17,410
fabrication is super short well for that

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,350
we bought at wax printer we bought one a

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,600
couple of years ago and it was working

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,410
good until we ran into some problems

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,020
that will technical problems of the

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,970
thermal here so we call the company once

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,250
and then they came and they repair and

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,540
then a couple of years later one year

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,339
actually we had problems again so when

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,829
they come they said no no we don't have

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:44,140
much spare parts now so you have to wait

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,329
for a while and then when we call them

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,130
the third time then they said no no we

00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:51,510
don't have the spare parts anymore and

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,070
the thing is that Xerox in this case is

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,250
discontinued the fabrication of these

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,649
this models so then we say well we boy

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,370
we buy a new winding so we bought a new

00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:05,199
one and then this one hasn't run into

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,050
problems but we saw also in the webpage

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:13,750
that Xerox is not fabricating new models

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:18,339
anymore and later we wanted to buy a wax

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,470
cubes for printing and now the our usual

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,630
supplier is not providing them anymore

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,230
so we are looking for other suppliers

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,959
and probably they will disappear in some

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,980
time so if if we don't have this anymore

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:36,700
then we can not do our research anymore

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:39,329
so so here is where we're free and

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,860
open-source hardware comes to rescue a

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:44,079
couple of years ago and read this book

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,930
it's very good when I recommend it to

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,850
you is called open source lab and it was

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,480
very exciting to read it because it

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,700
basically says that you don't need to

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,010
buy a very fancy equipment you can

00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,490
fabricate your own equipment and set it

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,529
up in your lab so from from these from

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,620
this researcher is his name is Yu Shu

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:08,890
appears so once I read this book it was

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:13,300
very excited and later this was this was

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,490
released in 2013 and then into 2016 he

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,020
he wrote this paper it's called

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,120
open source a wax replica 3d printer and

00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,670
when I saw this one this is the solution

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,430
for us if we can build on our own wax

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,250
printer if we can build our own wax

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:33,579
printer then then we're safe and we can

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:37,750
maintain the printer by ourselves so

00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:39,220
this is what they did they took well

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,180
this is more or less old right

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:46,420
so they took RepRap a Prusa Mendel and

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,329
they modified the extruder here to be

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:54,720
able to extrude wax now this is more or

00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:54,720
less how they the extruder looks like

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:02,560
wait I saw this paper we had the idea to

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:06,240
to build our own but we didn't hand we

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:10,089
didn't have hands to build the thing and

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,060
luckily this year thanks to this program

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:15,130
from km u tt is called Taiwan km u TT

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,130
internship program we go three students

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:21,700
from from Taiwan during two months in

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,490
our lab and when I saw their backgrounds

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:28,600
I thought well this is our chance to to

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:31,390
make the project real so two of them are

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,950
mechanical engineering and well in the

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,330
program of mechanical engineering and

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,490
one in the program of material

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,610
engineering so it was perfect for the

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,100
project so I think to them for

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:46,150
initiating the the project that that we

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,980
hopefully continued and approved so it

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,260
was a challenge for them as well because

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,610
even when they are mechanical will they

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,350
end the program of mechanical

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,130
engineering and they can do this kind of

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,410
things very very easily with not much

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,780
problems they didn't have much

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,450
experience on on programming and in

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,110
electronics so it was good experience

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,890
for them because it is sort of

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,590
multidisciplinary project for them

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,990
because they had to get in a bit of

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,590
informatics and programming and also get

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,140
into a bit of electronics as well so

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,000
they had to study the the film work well

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:26,080
at least the settings of the film were

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,280
from Marlene and adapted to make theirs

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:36,310
they extruded words and this is after

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:39,880
after two months of hard work what they

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,650
got I thought yeah this is more or less

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,190
what I expected that they could build a

00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,750
machine but I I was not sure whether the

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,050
machine would work properly

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,750
after these two months so well they did

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,150
they didn't they work very hard they did

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,250
very well and the machine is partially

00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,050
working so far but now we have to

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,320
continue ourselves because they they

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:06,430
return to to Taiwan like like a couple

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,670
of weeks ago so the machine now is is

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,430
built with a precise iteration three and

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,060
this is how they their extruder looks

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,980
like we had to modify the parts to to

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,780
fit the components that we have in our

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,360
lab so we didn't spend much money on

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,290
this and it consists of a motor that

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,650
pushes the piston of the syringe and the

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,170
outside of the syringe is covered with a

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,060
copper tube so the copper tube is

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,350
connected with a heater a normal heater

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,110
of a 3d printer

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,300
so that you hits the syringe and the

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,490
syringe contains wax and when the wax is

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:49,060
is molten then the piston pushes down

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:52,180
and a couple of days before they left

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,400
they try to to print wax actually the

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,880
only ones we had that at that time in

00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:01,150
the lab was candle wax so well we tried

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,820
with that and the results were not good

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,420
because candle wax from from the

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,910
experience we got melts very quickly

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:13,210
yeah but also gets cold very quick

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:16,450
quickly as well so when the the wax is

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:19,480
molting here and then reaches the end of

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,930
the syringe it gets cold very fast and

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,930
blocks the the tip of the nozzle so it

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,280
was very difficult to paint with wax

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:33,400
with candle wax at least and later a

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:36,190
well due to time mostly we told the

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,930
students ok when just try with with

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,210
Vaseline because Vaseline is also

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,090
oil-based so it should block water as

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:45,460
well and it is a bit viscous so well you

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,780
you can clean with that and they tried

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,070
and they actually could print the

00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,190
pattern I don't know whether you see the

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,890
pattern here and the other good thing of

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,650
the of the 3d printer is that is that it

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:59,320
comes here yeah is that it comes here

00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,450
with a with a heater so with this heater

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:07,089
we can melt the wax again and reflow it

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:10,060
to get inside the paper so this is how

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:13,360
the printed pattern looks like and after

00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,100
melting a well you see that the the wax

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,300
got well device I mean in this case got

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,829
inside a the paper and could actually

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,260
fabricate the channels later the

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,140
students tried with with liquid here and

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,630
the liquid actually could flow but

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,330
Vaseline is not it's not very good so

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,170
some of the sample you see that that

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,270
went out so what is remaining for us is

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,970
to try with different kind of works so

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,160
instead of candle wax that doesn't work

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:45,970
that because it's too let's say it has

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,360
low in thermal energy let's say

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,419
Vaseline that is not it's like very

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,909
viscous it's like a paste these are very

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,980
to to very extreme cases so we would

00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:00,370
like to try with something like in the

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,759
middle like these waxes that that girls

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,830
used for for depilation or also paraffin

00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,649
wax as well yeah they are more or less

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,169
in between in terms of physical

00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:14,950
characteristics so we have to try with

00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:19,720
that first and we'll at least the thing

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:23,139
is working now well to close the top I

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,299
will give a couple of final words for

00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:27,759
the students it was a very good

00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:30,129
experience because they they got aware

00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,909
of the importance of free and open

00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:35,679
source hardware because they they

00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,659
realize that if we build our own

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,879
machines then we can give ourself

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,759
support of the machines and get more

00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:44,379
independent from the companies also it

00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,269
was a good experience for them because

00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:49,870
they required like multidisciplinary

00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:52,330
knowledge and in terms of design they

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:55,330
got aware of of these five well these

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,200
four freedoms from software that we can

00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:01,809
also apply to hell with the first one

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,539
when you have a design of her wall you

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,879
need the freedom to to make to make the

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:09,309
device yeah and this is related to

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,750
patents so they they got aware of of

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:16,750
patents or patents as well and second

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,059
they they got all of the information to

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,179
read about the design and modify the

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:24,779
design so they got that we're also of

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:28,919
copyrights yeah

00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:32,200
and also ordered in copyrights

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,080
they got aware that the the format's

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,960
they were using we're not open so not

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,940
everyone could read their files if they

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,100
wanted so we have to translate it to

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,840
open open formats and also these open

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,690
formats would enable other people to

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,970
modify our design if they want so to

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,980
close the cycle we still need to put

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,309
this in the internet so other people can

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,970
modify our designs and and complete the

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:03,670
cycling

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:07,970
do I still have one or two minutes yeah

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:10,850
no yeah to mean it's good because I want

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:16,510
to show you the videos of the of the

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,510
printings these are very short actually

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:31,990
what is the VLC well doesn't matter yeah

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:42,230
yeah I will just double click oh yeah oh

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:47,680
it was working but no it's not okay yeah

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,680
oh no it's no it's not it's this one

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,850
yeah that one so this is a video showing

00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,550
when we are printing candle works you

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,850
see that at well at the beginning it was

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:06,350
very liquid oh yeah at the beginning it

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,840
was very liquid because the temperature

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,760
was too high and we couldn't control the

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,590
printing and later we decrease the

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,230
temperature to control a bit better the

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:18,770
printer but still we couldn't control

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,780
the the printing correctly and this is

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:24,760
because of the the temperature that

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:28,360
changes too quickly in candle wax and

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,360
the second one

00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,170
the second one is when we printed with

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:41,900
with Vaseline you see that the control

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,900
is much better we actually could print

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,130
but as I told you before the problem

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,320
with with the Vaseline is that it is not

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,200
strong enough to contain all of the kind

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,059
of samples that we use so that's the

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,700
reason we have to try other kind of wax

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,400
but now we have a good starting point

00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,970
anyway well thank you very much for your

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,100
attention

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,500
and well if you have any questions

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,360
you're welcome to ask or if you don't

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,180
have questions now you can ask me later

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:13,279
during the breaks thank you very much

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,279
