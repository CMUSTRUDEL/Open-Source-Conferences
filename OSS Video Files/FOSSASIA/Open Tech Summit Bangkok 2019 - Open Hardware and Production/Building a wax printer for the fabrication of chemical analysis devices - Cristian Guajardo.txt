In the last decades, chemical analysis has been moving from the laboratory to hand-held devices, of which the glucose meter (for diabetes pacients) and pregnancy test are two successful examples. Paper-based microfluidics is a new technology that holds the promise of removing expensive and cumbersome instrumentation from chemical analysis devices, while still performing sophisticated medical and agricultural diagnostics. These devices are commonly fabricated using paper containing fluid channels made out of wax, which conduct the liquid sample during the analysis. In this talk, we tell our experience of adopting free and open source technology to modify an existing design of wax printer, and to use it as an student project for our laboratory.
