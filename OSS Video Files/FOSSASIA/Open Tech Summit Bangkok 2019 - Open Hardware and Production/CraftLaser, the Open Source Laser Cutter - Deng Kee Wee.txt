Description: 
	Deng Kee Wee

The CraftLaser is the first Full-metal enclosure CO2 laser cutter that provides maximum protection to you and your family, much like owning a Blu-ray Player, it is a Class 1 Laser equipment. The CraftLaser is lightweight and has a luggable design that makes it the only CO2 laser cutter that is stowable and perfect for users with limited space. Also, you do not need to plug in an extra air extractor (also means you donâ€™t need to be close to a window or door to vent the extracted air) and you also do not need to plug in an external cooling system to use it. No ugly water pipings and pails of water to deal with.

all right okay so um probably is very

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,349
sweet 40 watt co2 laser cutter but

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,030
Before we jump into what trough laser is

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,500
let's just talk about what laser cutter

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,480
is um for a lot of maker spaces or

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,590
schools universities you can see that

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,680
yeah this very good rapid prototyping

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,920
tool called the laser cutter so you can

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,529
see that the for allocation if you want

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,770
to do rapid project fabrication you can

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:40,320
see can do a lot of like toys

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:42,750
applications projects so the for if you

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,520
want to do like for theory education you

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,070
can do like enterprise training for

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,199
instance you want to train students to

00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,090
able to run business develop products

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,210
and then you want to like user

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,090
University facilities to allow them to

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,309
test out some of the things they can

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,320
sell tender and the price range so laser

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,979
cutter is one of those tools that allows

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,610
you to produce ready for market product

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:15,000
versus conventional plastic tree

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,740
demeanor so like we all know that if you

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,240
pretty print something I mean I'm

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,740
talking about a normal tree Peter

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,259
there's nothing much that you can

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,610
actually sell to the market from the 3d

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,100
printer whereas for laser cutter almost

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,329
when you produce the product you can

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,710
almost sell immediately um then he we

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,869
are talking about steam education what

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,950
about science technology engineering

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:45,060
arts and mathematics so all these can be

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:47,159
what we could apply learning curriculum

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,850
that students can apply the science

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,070
knowledge engineering knowledge into a

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,829
chopped or that way for example right on

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,360
the screen here teaching the teachings

00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,790
kids like what is

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,590
planetary gear gear system just

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,270
laser-cut and you can design your own

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,099
gear system then the for those who are

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,539
using these for home or for small

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,539
business it has its own

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,040
use also for instance I think I'm

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,240
missing a picture here but anyway so you

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,430
can see that you can make things like

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,520
cross and gives home in Tikal this is

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,170
actually a laser cut lamb-lamb shape

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,140
there's a lot of things you can do with

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,050
laser cutting from chairs to table to

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,420
kitchenware and you can sell this for a

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,870
lot of money so it's a big industry Tony

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,480
so people who do fashion like for

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,470
example you're going to cut a fabric

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
leather so we can create a Paris for

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:51,630
people to wear so all these are also a

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,630
good industry powered by laser cutting

00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,970
okay so the so what makes a craft laser

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:05,080
so special compared to the other laser

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,150
cutter is that despite the fact that

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,310
craft laser is actually a open-source

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,230
project is actually met every single

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,310
safety requirement in the industry just

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:21,040
a name a few for the safety wise we are

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,430
class one laser safety for laser cut for

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,250
laser they are actually for level of

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,769
laser safety class 1 class 2 class 3 and

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,500
class 4 cutting laser are definitely a

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,560
class 4 laser so 2 for class fall is up

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,870
by right by right you need to have

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,570
license right you need an export license

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,130
you need to have ownership license for

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,610
the user to use in the co2 safety

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:50,049
training before you can use a class 4

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,850
laser cutter however crop is a despite

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,890
the fact that he has a class 4 laser

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,640
cutting power it's certified as a class

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,430
1 laser

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,010
class 1 laser is no different than your

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,350
CD player so you don't need any license

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,870
your do any any special training you do

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,870
need any safety features like for

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,269
example safety the lock for the door

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,160
only students only a technician can open

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,140
in enter into this room to use a machine

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,239
you know any any of these so you can see

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,750
that we have the machine park just

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,280
before children's or anybody in the

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,480
public hedges use the machine is ok

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:29,770
because it is a +1 laser

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:32,710
so that means it is not the machine is

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:38,530
certified class one not by me but by ul

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,419
so ul is underwriters laboratory they

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,840
are actually the u.s. completes the

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:47,020
company so the one of the few

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,700
professional salvation company certified

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,210
products so we actually get them to

00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,130
certify our product the reason is that

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,070
we want to enter into the US market

00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:01,600
so by once we are certified by ul we can

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,260
enter into US market very easily so the

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,900
second part of the city is what I called

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:11,140
NFPA it is extended that is the National

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,180
Fire Protection Association standard so

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,910
they set a lease or recommendation in

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,910
terms of how you should design your

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:22,180
product such that it can meet fire

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:25,229
protection requirements so for craft

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,090
laser we actually develop in accordance

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:30,820
the equivalent standards of in scenery

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,290
other means you actually oven they

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,300
actually but have things burning inside

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,290
we are the only laser cutter as design

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,120
according to that standards so the

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,080
because if you were to go to the market

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,200
you take a look

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,150
laser cutter do not have the on fire

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,100
protection system so craft laser is all

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,979
the only laser cutter with its own fire

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,680
protection system the next part here

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,810
it's a why craft laser is I show you a

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,660
flexible system the holding is compact

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,300
and portable the machine is way on in

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,150
less than 50 pounds that is actually to

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,330
meet the OSHA requirement is occupations

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,490
safety hazard Association that

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,310
recommends that the maximum weight a man

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,350
can carry is 50 pound that's why you're

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,690
checking luggage

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,610
cannot be more than 23 kg that's reason

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,250
because the the person who carried

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,400
luggage into the cargo bay

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,430
cannot carry one person more than 23 kg

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,729
that's why for our crop is it designed

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,330
to be only 23 kg stupa like later I'll

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:37,770
show you a video of why I mean that the

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:40,949
portability of the machine also

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,380
not least the our system is also

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,169
all-in-one system normally Socata will

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,400
need his own smoke management system

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,009
because when you do cutting that's a

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,699
lost me he needs to have his own air

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,039
compressor to provide Asus without a

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,569
compressor your material but you need to

00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,940
have compressed air to push the fire

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,009
away from the material then lastly you

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,690
need to have a cooling system so for

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:10,080
profit you don't need any external

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:12,990
support system is all built inside so

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,759
the important here is that Kravis

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,530
despite the fact that he saw open source

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:21,810
project he is already in full production

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:25,650
so these are all our happy customers

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,229
that actually has the machines so just

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,259
kind of give you a glimpse from left to

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:34,110
right so on the on your extreme left top

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,400
left hand corner that's career so you

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,759
can see the machine you went to career

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,409
so there are current friends and from

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,940
there is our schools so there are teas

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:44,960
of summer school makerspace to actually

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,780
own a machine and then at the bottom

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:54,150
left this is you can see students using

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,889
machine themself right and right in the

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,539
center this you'll be surprised that

00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,340
this is actually actually a singapore

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,650
library so we actually brought the

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,340
machine into a library to run a workshop

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:08,550
so this is a testament to how safe the

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,909
machine is so other things and more

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,650
schools more happy teachers so we also

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:16,740
doing a lot xbs are doing now

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,039
this was done in Singapore during the

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,719
Mexican national day festival so we can

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,860
see that a lot of kids I really love the

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:27,960
machine and as a power publicity stand

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,569
down here this is actually a restaurant

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,310
or Hawker Center a coffee shop so we

00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:38,130
just bring the Machine de laser cut

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:39,930
something for the four customers so so

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,659
basically what I'm trying to show you

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,600
here is that crop laser is not just a

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,180
concept it's not just a prototype he is

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
a open source project is in full

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,390
production delivered

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,360
improvement

00:08:51,390 --> 00:09:02,610
by it our customers that is a product

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:05,300
that works sorry it was just clicking on

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,300
yourself this lights

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:18,400
all right so before I jump into why

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,610
about my sauce I'll just show you some

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,610
video

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,110
look like you said speaker yeah

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,810
yeah oh I just uh put the HDMI Dory

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:16,000
you know yeah

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:17,470
no just using my PC like Sookie so we

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,090
achieved brought these to come on garden

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,520
so this is the second time the cottage

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,440
has been in Thailand the first time was

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,690
in Comicon

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,150
so we actually fly the machine to Koh

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,820
Samui then for some way which she take a

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,770
motorcycle and then after that we bring

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:38,830
it on a boat ride all the way to come

00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:50,140
back on yes I need to be a vides every

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:52,150
time so you see it's really 23 kg so so

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,150
it's a village so what we did here is

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,260
that as part of the recruiting about

00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,240
almond sauce is that I'm willing to

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,100
share the schematic so that they can

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,100
service the machine themself

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,520
so that is the again one example of the

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,030
portability so I'll show you a second

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,030
video these me in Singapore delivering

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,160
the machine who to the customer I can

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,330
see how easy he is to just put in the

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,330
car and just take you

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,210
so I hate my hair was longer than so you

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,100
can see you can just like this long on

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,260
the floor you don't react heavy and you

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,540
can see the smoke ha it's very easy for

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,700
her to just put behind a cobble it's

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:24,870
designed to be like that I need to take

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:26,340
out is also very easy and before that

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,570
actually we actually climbed the stairs

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,570
with the machine

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,840
so this is a business owner so they

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,150
actually do a business they are using

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,540
the laser cutter to do the packaging for

00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,540
their products

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,920
yep so the so you can see that see the

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,160
the product has been quite well proven

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,280
so whatever that we set on the design

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,090
criteria for the machine to be like pod

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,650
bow safe

00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,130
so we've met all those criteria so we

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:46,330
actually launched an IndieGoGo campaign

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:49,060
back in 2018 June so and campaign

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,510
completed in end of July and we make

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:58,210
delivery in May and we come May this

00:13:52,510 --> 00:14:02,440
year and by july 2019 we completed 100%

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:05,590
of our local and overseas commitment so

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,110
the whole process is only one year so

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:11,890
the end this is only big possible

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:14,890
because of open source if we do not have

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,600
adopter open source s the way the model

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,900
that we produce and develop product

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,510
there's no way we are able to push out a

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:27,310
product in one year including

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:31,630
certification so the so so in a way in

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:34,570
this open source forum so what is a

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,360
quick off Lisa how to do a open source I

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:40,420
just want to share my experience in the

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,600
journey of bring crowd leads into the

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,570
market what are the actual experience

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,910
why puppet sauce is so useful to develop

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,370
own products so the first point here is

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,340
that open source lower the barriers for

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,710
product development and also for

00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,510
production the reason why it lower the

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,520
barriers number one you do not have to

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,860
reinvent views though they are software

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,710
from where electronics component already

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,570
has been proven by the community over

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,000
many years so there's no need for you to

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,850
reinvent wheels so you also always

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,460
integrate open source solution or open

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:23,170
source development into your product and

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:25,360
in so doing weapon here that minimizes a

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,630
lot of your program risk and the cost

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,700
that comes with the risk so this one

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,830
body lowers the barrier and also from

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,350
the perspective of your technical

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,330
background if I were to develop the

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,940
software from scratch and not a software

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,380
engineer

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,780
if I need to develop electronics from

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,790
scratch I am NOT electronics engineer in

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,460
fact I'm not even an engineer but

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,020
without been any background true

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,550
open-source I can't give other products

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,530
from scratch so I don't care whether

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,880
Easter mechanical design I don't care

00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,120
whether it's the electrical design

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,790
electronic design firmware design I have

00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,590
to do this myself it's a one-man show so

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,490
this is only mcpaul

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:07,040
because of open source so remember I do

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:11,050
not have a team of engineer it just me

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,700
right so the next point here is that

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,610
just because the fact that you can you

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:20,000
can able to run your project so lean

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,520
without so many overheads in terms of

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,020
course you can now do why called a

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,700
competitive pricing so the energy is up

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,160
to you whether you want to make the you

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,620
want to lower them you want to lower the

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,970
cost increase your profit margin or you

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,180
want to lower the selling price and

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,120
benefit the customer so for me I choose

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,250
to benefit the customer so happen here

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,590
is that quad razor is six times cheaper

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:52,520
than your average laser cutter in the

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:54,590
market the next point is that as a open

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,870
source project the cutting here says

00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:00,220
once your product is open source by

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:03,860
design you always have growth potential

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,960
this is in the DNA of open source so

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,720
which means that as a product I want to

00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,810
increase more features it can be done

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,420
easily as compared to let's say I use

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,940
example if you buy a very fancy food

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,150
washing machine from some song or from

00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,640
LG so you try to upgrade that washing

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,530
machine is not going to happen right but

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,700
what if the Samsung's a fancy spa

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,510
washing machine is open source project

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,430
can it be upgraded and sergey's for sure

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,990
so what we did here is that in our

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,840
products we try to make sure it's open

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,700
source just because all so that it can

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:46,040
give us growth provision and potential

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,440
last but not least in the way you saw on

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,880
the video it can be open source allows

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,740
you to integrate into your servicing

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,810
solution just because the fact that you

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,820
have no problem with IP rights you can

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,460
now publish or the from where you can

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,290
publish all the schematics so that in a

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,570
way when I go to the the customer I can

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,670
teach them how to use and how to service

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,950
and that's it I don't have to find

00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,540
myself servicing the machine or forced

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,920
them to use my service to service a

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,010
machine they can service the machine

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,860
themselves so that actually give you an

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:20,010
advantage against other professional

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:28,980
company that forced them to buy the are

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:32,700
servicing package if not then the tests

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,290
or I have in terms of what Coughlin's I

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,730
can do is more importantly here that if

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,370
you're interested please come over to

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,610
the roof and do a quitter musician or

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:50,460
untrue at it as easier if not I'm ready

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:54,590
to take the question for the floor right

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:57,590
now is a 3,500 USD there about excluding

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,590
