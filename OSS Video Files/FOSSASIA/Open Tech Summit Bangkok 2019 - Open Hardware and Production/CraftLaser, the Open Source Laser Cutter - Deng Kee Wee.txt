The CraftLaser is the first Full-metal enclosure CO2 laser cutter that provides maximum protection to you and your family, much like owning a Blu-ray Player, it is a Class 1 Laser equipment. The CraftLaser is lightweight and has a luggable design that makes it the only CO2 laser cutter that is stowable and perfect for users with limited space. Also, you do not need to plug in an extra air extractor (also means you donâ€™t need to be close to a window or door to vent the extracted air) and you also do not need to plug in an external cooling system to use it. No ugly water pipings and pails of water to deal with.
