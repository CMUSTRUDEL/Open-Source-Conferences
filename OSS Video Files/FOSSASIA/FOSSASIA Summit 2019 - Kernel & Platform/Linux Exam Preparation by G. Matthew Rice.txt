should do well first off welcome

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,010
everybody thanks for coming

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,760
just a quick poll hands up if you've

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,840
heard of the linux professional

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:17,810
institute before all right well then I'm

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:22,590
glad I'm here just a quick background

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:25,080
about LP I as most people know it well

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,630
first of all hi I'm Matthew rice I'm the

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,369
executive director of the Braille P I

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:33,120
have been for the last three or so years

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,440
I am a certified by the organization

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,270
that happened while I was still a

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,190
volunteer so yeah you know the linux

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,079
professional institute was incorporated

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:49,500
as a non-profit back in 1999 we do have

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:54,570
regional offices in a couple of dozen

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:58,399
countries and in that time we've

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,109
developed a track a graduated track of

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,780
education standards that people can use

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:16,909
to learn how to use linux in a

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:19,590
professional setting here this

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,530
presentation here is gonna be very brief

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,290
because what we use the rest of it for

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,729
is an opportunity to dive into some of

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,470
the objectives of some of the

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,049
certifications and it depends on what

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:40,340
you guys are interested in which ones we

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:43,979
cover so it's very short agenda LP i

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,450
would exams inserts we have most

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,369
importantly how prepare for the exam

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,259
it's whenever frequently asked questions

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,799
not just how to prepare but how to

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:57,030
actually go and take the exam for some

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,189
reason we make it hard for people and as

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,439
well if you do go to take the exam what

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,930
you should expect you know format how

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,659
long the exam is how many you need to

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,220
take and then also what happens

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,500
afterwards you know how you get your

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:18,370
results

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:20,740
to expect just standard disclaimer I

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,000
might not know what I'm talking about

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,870
but until you're certified you won't

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,550
know magic so you learn this down a lot

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,130
of people just use our objectives

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,930
actually for a study guide many don't go

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,360
on to get certified usually because

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,330
they're already working in the field and

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,830
you know they're happy about it but they

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,070
want to make sure that they're not

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,150
missing anything and for LPI

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,840
certifications we sort of cover do the

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:51,860
80/20 you know we cover the stuff that

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,459
you need to know daily to do a job using

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,690
Linux and there's no way we could cover

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,400
everything so we rely on a group of

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,989
volunteers around the world sometimes up

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,489
to a thousand guys that end girls that

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,989
answer some surveys tell us how

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,600
important certain things are and how

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,519
often you have to use the that knowledge

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,350
and based on that that's what we used to

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,350
create the objectives for various exams

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,130
so our mission is actually not to be a

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,650
certification but our mission is to try

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,560
and get everybody using open-source

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:37,100
everywhere and not just for professional

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,070
use but home use hobbyists anything like

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,750
that

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:45,320
no they slip this one slide in that's

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,300
why I did this earlier all right the

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,290
other thing about our certifications is

00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,670
they're not tied to any particular

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,140
vendor we do cover the two main streams

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,790
of distributions

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,070
you know the RPM based ones and the D

00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,810
packaged ones so by the time you're

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,850
finished preparing for this

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,830
certification you should be comfortable

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,520
in both of those environments in fact

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,500
you strongly suggested you you use both

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,320
of them regularly you know whether it's

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,760
Debian or bun 2 or Linux Mint Debian

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,040
Edition which is my favorite or you know

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:24,230
CentOS Fedora souza

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:27,410
any of those we don't cover the gooey

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,180
parts of configuring a system because to

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,740
be quite frank most of the time you're

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,730
going to be using Linux on a server or

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:38,330
in a virtual machine or using containers

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,890
and my personal preference is not to

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,280
install gooey stuff on those servers

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:46,420
anyway so we do expect you to be very

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,420
comfortable in the command line

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:57,229
this is a very boring map but it shows

00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:59,869
you actually where we have at least one

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:04,579
certification holder in in any country

00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:07,399
so a country in gold or yellow there we

00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:11,619
have certification holders there's 13

00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:14,449
countries so far that I've been able to

00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:17,149
find someone or they I've been able to

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:22,449
find us but you know it's the it's the

00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:24,910
usual suspects North Korea Syria Somalia

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:28,029
Central Africa

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,029
[Music]

00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:38,819
over the last 20 years we've had about a

00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,309
quarter of million people attempt to get

00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,039
certified and a hundred and sixty-five

00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:47,239
thousand of them have have managed to

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:52,429
pass at least one of our certifications

00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:56,399
we've delivered over 600,000 exams and

00:05:52,429 --> 00:06:00,239
they're delivered in nine languages and

00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:04,409
and growing I'm hoping this year we'll

00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:06,269
be adding perhaps Arabic and Korean but

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:13,529
right now it's English French Spanish

00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:20,779
Portuguese Japanese Chinese missing one

00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:20,779
Italian and we'll add Morris we can

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,430
so one of the benefits about our

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,920
certifications is they're not tied to a

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,370
particular vendor or their product these

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,360
are skills that if you learn them now

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,570
you'll probably be using them still in

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,720
10-15 years I I got my level 1

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,870
certification back in 2002 and quite

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,000
frankly underneath the hood except for

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,040
you know some fun things like systemd if

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,020
you've heard of it

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,650
Linux is still the same Linux it was 20

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,950
years ago

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,470
yeah the other thing is certification

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,310
it's not a panacea this is usually a

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:07,380
warning to hiring people HR managers

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,630
that sort certification is not the

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,640
absolute proof that you can do a job all

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,250
right so it's an indication that they've

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,500
studied they've learned more than

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,020
probably the person interviewing them

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,940
and they're you know dedicated to

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,610
becoming a professional and they're

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,310
taking this area it is a globally

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,810
recognized credential actually we do

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,570
have some partners that use these

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:36,750
credentials as a prerequisite for their

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:43,320
credentials right now I mean it used to

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:46,020
be Susa did that Ubuntu for a while but

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,570
also some you know partners that have

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,630
open source based products where they

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,890
have engineers going off into the field

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:57,810
they're not a distribution they're just

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,760
a an appliance or something and you know

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,220
they think this is is the appropriate

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,480
preparation for those engineers aside

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,830
from getting training in their products

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,560
of course we don't man and mandate any

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,080
particular type of study or method if

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,160
you like video learning and you want to

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,350
go to Linux Academy or plural site or

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,440
NDG you're welcome to do that if you

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,900
like books you can do that as well if

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,180
you want to set up study groups lots of

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,190
people do that to support each other and

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,610
encourage each other to continue

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:36,120
learning instead of you know get into it

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,190
later and some people just like to print

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,370
out our check you know our checklist for

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,680
the

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,650
objectives for some of the exams that

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,860
can run into six to ten pages of details

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,260
of exactly what we expect you to know

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,140
for the exams we try not to surprise

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,650
anybody will tell you exactly what we

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,750
think you should know and we don't try

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,520
to trick you with tricky answers to the

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:11,279
questions you either know it or you

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:15,630
don't and and we try and keep it fair so

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,060
this this is our current track okay we

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,130
do have an educational certificate so if

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,110
you're brand-new to Linux you've never

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,620
touched even the computer or even never

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,750
touched a Linux desktop we do suggest

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,170
you take a look at linux essentials

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,600
first it covers the basis the very

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,990
basics about getting alone around on

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,950
command-line some background about open

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:46,830
source and free software and it's a very

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:48,959
gentle introduction to using Linux we do

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,810
target it more towards you know high

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,250
schools and universities but also a lot

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,830
of professionals that are you know

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,990
switching careers will take this as a

00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,400
you know get a taste of what they're in

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,470
for

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,440
we also find that if you don't have any

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,740
prior experience to look in Linux it

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,910
also does improve you know how well you

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,130
do on an L pick one whether you actually

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,910
go and get a certificate or not it's not

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,450
a requirement it's really just - it's

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,120
it's one of our ways that we use to get

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,160
you know Linux and open source education

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,339
into you know high schools you know it's

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,770
it's some education standards just teach

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,420
this to them and at that point they'll

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,260
be informed enough and know whether or

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,260
not they want to continue

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:45,870
on the professional track we have

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:49,530
they'll pick one that's been 1999 or

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,670
2000 when it was first launched it's now

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,610
at version 5

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,460
okay Linux does change a little bit so

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,350
every three years we take a look at how

00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,860
you know whether it's versions of

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:07,950
software a brand new changes and we

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:12,270
adapt the what we expect you to know so

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,650
once you know your system well then we

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,400
start getting into other things like

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:20,040
network services and and some advanced

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,020
topics which is I'll pick two and then

00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,270
we get into the enterprise level which

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,410
is mixed environments

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,540
mostly a Samba for exam at this point

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,550
security enterprise security topics and

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,030
one that we're actually breaking into

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:38,310
two different certifications later this

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:43,770
year virtualization and high

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:46,130
availability and two years ago we also

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:49,680
released a DevOps tools engineer

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,990
certification the reason L pick one is

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,180
not a requirement is we recognize that

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,330
these tools are not always just used on

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,490
Linux so we recommend though before you

00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:05,210
do it that you're extremely comfortable

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:09,810
in your operating system of choice and

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:11,550
then going off stocks and trust me it's

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,650
it's easy to just jump to the fun stuff

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,110
which is you know they'll pick two

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,730
topics and the DevOps but it means

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,550
you'll be missing a lot of stuff that

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,870
you don't know you don't know which come

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,460
in very very handy later on and keep you

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,570
you know prevent you from becoming a

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,570
security nightmare as well

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:38,140
so for linux essentials again this one

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,200
breaks the mold for our professional

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:48,190
track in this one it's it's 60 minute

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:50,770
test and there's 40 questions okay if

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,690
you're prepared it's plenty of time I've

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,580
never seen anyone that's prepared for

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,990
the exam run at a time trying to answer

00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:02,650
the questions and again it's a

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,060
completely separate track for from from

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:08,400
the professional level track although

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:10,960
some groups do use it for helpdesk level

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,240
type jobs where someone just needs to

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,540
know enough Linux to get onto a remote

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,280
server maybe check some logs runs to the

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:26,230
s you do do you guys say yes you do or

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:33,900
su do well because I I call the command

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:38,620
su all right we won't belabor that point

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,660
the DevOps tools engineer it's exam 701

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,090
it's a completely different track from

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,730
the L pick ones that we call our open

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,970
technology track I don't think there's

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:52,780
any slides on it but later this year

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:56,200
were releasing a bsd unix certification

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:59,860
as well there is a group that's been

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,920
going for 15 years or so called the bsd

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:06,760
certification group and they've merged

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,980
their efforts with us so that we could

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,010
help them get that certification more

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:19,330
broadly available worldwide they'll pick

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:25,080
one each exam is the next slide each

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:29,500
exam is 60 questions sorry 60 questions

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,480
90 minutes but for level one there's two

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,660
exams you have to take and we break it

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,130
up so it's not too much studying at once

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,650
you can just tackle half the subject

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,900
area and then you know get an early win

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,940
take that exam if you want or you know

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,300
continue on and prepare for both at the

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,300
same time

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,000
level two the same thing

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:55,010
this one oh sorry for your attention

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,410
again I'll pick one you're still on your

00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,780
own system you do set up a few services

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,090
like making sure that your your own

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,620
system always has the correct time but

00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:10,280
it's just more things to keep your own

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:12,410
server internally then we let you attack

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,650
the network all right so some advanced

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:21,110
system topics but also you know setting

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:24,250
up Web Services FTP DNS you know

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,750
essential network infrastructure that

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,320
Linux has been doing since the 90s and

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:33,710
doing very well

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:35,630
oh the other thing I should mention is

00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,210
because this is a graduated

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,880
certification track you do have to have

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,980
your L pick one in order for us to award

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,050
you an L pick to you and the reason is

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,090
it's a cumulative knowledge stack and

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,460
just because you know how to set up an

00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,640
FTP service doesn't mean you know and

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,500
understand permissions ownership files

00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,730
well enough to make sure that you're

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,730
going to be doing that securely

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:10,129
and usually once unless someone's a

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,769
dedicated student you know if they're

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,600
doing this during their work life and

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,779
they're you know adding skills as they

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,149
go normally it takes about five years of

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,160
experience or so again depends on the

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:33,410
person before they're ready for some of

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:39,379
these enterprise level topics so how to

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:43,059
prepare for the exam so again 90 minutes

00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:47,149
60 questions except for essentials and

00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:50,059
we have two main formats of questions

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,549
multiple choice believe it or not it's

00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:55,339
harder than you think and each of those

00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:59,269
multiple choice questions will have four

00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:01,730
or five potential answers you just have

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,769
to choose the correct one if there's

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,959
more than one correct answer we tell you

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,519
again there's no tricks if there's two

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,380
correct answers in that list we'll ask

00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:14,449
you to choose two all right

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,519
three right and then we also have to

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,740
fill in the blank ones all right

00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,630
the the the answers to the fill in the

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,380
blank questions are always the technical

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,539
term or or file name or something like

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,159
that we do that to make sure that it's

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:33,950
easy to translate otherwise written in

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:37,970
English or French answers it's that's

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,159
tough to to score automatically okay now

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,350
again there may be multiple correct

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:45,440
answers you know if you get a question

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:50,659
asking you you know a basic tar command

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:53,149
line there's usually about 12 to 15

00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:56,260
variations that would be acceptable you

00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:59,240
only have to put one in some people will

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,889
try to answer you know this is the

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,809
answer and then they'll put a comma or a

00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:04,850
colon or something and this is the

00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,740
answer and this is the answer and if

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,429
you're taking the test through the

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,889
through the view Network which is

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:15,710
regional local test centers that are set

00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:27,770
up with partners of theirs

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:30,120
don't do that the one thing to know is

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,650
it's kinda like that joke what do you

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:41,970
call the guy who finished his last in

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:45,810
medical school doctor all right

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:49,890
you basically get a pass or fail we we

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,780
do what's called scaled scoring right so

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:56,100
the score is always between two and

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,680
eight hundred a 500 is pass it doesn't

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,960
mean 50% it doesn't mean 75% of the

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,780
questions were right it depends on each

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,910
version of the exam that is given

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:09,090
because each set of exam questions have

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:12,450
different difficulties all right so the

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,310
reason we don't give a percentage is we

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,850
want you to know that if you take this

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,710
test and you score 600 and you go and

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,100
take this you know a different version

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,700
of this test two or three or four months

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,160
later you should get about the same

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,750
score if not the same score again

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,400
assuming you didn't learn anything those

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:37,080
last three months that's covered on the

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,330
test and we do this so that you know you

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,900
can tell you know how well you did

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:48,200
relative to the pass one relative to

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,200
everybody else

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:03,440
all right we put the exam objectives up

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:06,330
on our website but we also have a more a

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,410
printable version that you can get on

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:13,380
our wiki it's also where we put updates

00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,760
and new versions that are in draft so if

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,230
you want to see what's coming if you're

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,030
you know if you know that we're going to

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,280
be releasing an update to the exam in

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,680
three or four months and you want to see

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,200
if there's some additional things you

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,090
should be studying take a look at the

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,140
wiki we'll be putting all the info we

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:34,950
put all the information that the other

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,840
thing is we have versions for these so

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,800
right now we're at version five four

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,450
I'll pick one and I'll pick two and if

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,430
you're going and buying books or

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,530
anything like that and you know they're

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,510
discounted they're probably discounted

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,630
for a reason you know they're back on

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,590
version for version three in their

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,770
posters just getting rid of some stock

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,500
okay so always double check before you

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:02,130
take the exam which version you were

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:06,420
studying guests when we do release a new

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:08,130
version we leave a six month overlap so

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,630
that people that are going through say a

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,900
high school or a university program

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,550
that's a four or five month semester

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,530
they still have an opportunity to take

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,810
that exam even though they were studying

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,780
the previous first all right

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:25,860
but again Linux doesn't change a whole

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:29,190
lot every you know week or month so you

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,630
know an old version still okay hopefully

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,940
you'll take a look at what the changes

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,340
are between versions we do print to a

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,590
diff or for everybody so that you can

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,590
just study the updated materials as well

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,420
the other thing we do and we'll be doing

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:55,300
this

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:57,610
actually if you want oh okay all right

00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:01,840
the other way we delivered the exam is

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:07,870
not just at events like Lynx fest scale

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:10,450
Z but next year hopefully Foss Asia but

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,000
we also do this with some partners in in

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,680
remote areas where you know quite

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,870
frankly the test centers and the

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,450
network's they just don't have any test

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:22,330
centers there but we have some partners

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,560
that are teaching people there and we'll

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,520
arrange for them to do a paper version

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,470
of the exam the the only downfall to

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,110
this approach is that they do have to

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,320
send the the answer sheets into us and

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,760
we scan them in and you know score them

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,440
that way and so we tell people it'll

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,230
take you know up to a month for them to

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,890
get the results it's quite often less

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,830
than two weeks but people usually want

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,180
to know right away although that's not

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:53,050
how it worked for me in high school and

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,370
university but you know people are used

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,930
to taking it with view where you get

00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,160
your score immediately and yeah they're

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:05,500
disappointed when they find out it

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,450
doesn't work that way at the paper - if

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,540
you take it through the Pearson VUE test

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:15,060
network the easiest way to book the exam

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,050
is just go to view comm / LPI all right

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,490
over on the right side of the page

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:23,740
you'll see find a test center there are

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:27,430
quite a few there's a few at least here

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:29,740
in Singapore the nice thing about it is

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:33,000
they don't have to be a you know quite

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,850
often as a training company or or school

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,950
we'll set up a view test centre and they

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,560
actually quite often make it available

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,850
for any test that views delivering for

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:48,460
their partners you know whether it's

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:50,170
Cisco test Microsoft IBM ours most of

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,720
the tech certifications out there right

00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:57,600
now that are generally available to

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,600
public they're available through the v8s

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:08,370
so on exam day try not to stress

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,050
yourself out rest up before you do it

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:16,890
don't cram and do any last-minute

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:18,390
cramming helps and you know dose

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:23,820
yourself appropriately with your

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:27,450
caffeine and sugar you know you guys

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,010
know all these things right the other

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,720
thing you'll have to do is bring some

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,390
photo ID all right

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,550
you are verified it has to be something

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,190
usually issued by the government whether

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:41,340
it's your license your passport

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:44,700
citizenship card residence card anything

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,150
like that would be acceptable the other

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,360
thing you need to know is your LPI ID

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:54,300
it's a it's a nine digit string and you

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,800
can get that oh well you can get that by

00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:02,880
else just going to LPI that org slash

00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:04,320
register if you do go to view and that's

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,320
especially important if you come in to a

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,720
paper version of the exam if you go to

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,030
view and you just take the exam and you

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,340
just ignore that question because they

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:22,530
do ask for the ID will automatically

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:24,990
assign you one so read all the questions

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:29,040
carefully okay we don't try to trick you

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:33,650
but you know sometimes something does

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:37,170
look like a correct answer but it's not

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,760
and in my experience taking tests the

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,970
first answer I pick is usually the right

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,970
one

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,400
multiple choice there's always one

00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,420
correct answer again unless you see in

00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:00,170
little parentheses

00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:02,480
please select X number of answers for

00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,340
the fill in the blank ones if we if

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,520
you're expected to know the path to a

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,790
file or a directory will be explicit and

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,270
say that if we if we just want the

00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:21,770
command name or an option name just put

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:23,480
that part people miss this part of the

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:28,130
question all the time I don't know why

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,870
and it's and that's usually you know it

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,630
you know you've got a lot of time to

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,880
review your answers before you submit

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:39,470
the you know you're finished the exam

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,450
take the time review the answers you

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,690
know if when you're going through the

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:47,780
exam if you're not certain about an

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,430
answer or a question you can skip it and

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,770
you just come back to it later you know

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,450
take these ones do the ones you know and

00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:57,410
then you can focus on the ones they hear

00:26:53,450 --> 00:27:01,300
less certain about or might need some

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,300
math because we're asking about subnets

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:11,000
you're also not penalized or penalized

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:13,430
if you answer a question incorrectly so

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,630
there's never any reason to leave any of

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:21,980
these or any of the questions unanswered

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:24,410
again for some reason people do and hey

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,630
we we do we use something called cycle

00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:30,860
metrics to make sure these exams are

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:34,160
fair and consistent between versions and

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,920
we factor in the you know twenty percent

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,190
of guessing answers will possibly be

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,290
correct which is why if you get twenty

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,880
percent of the questions right on the

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,570
exam you actually get the same scores if

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,570
you got zero right

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:58,160
we have a number of people spend a lot

00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,500
of time poring over these questions as

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,570
none of just asked me write them but if

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,250
anyone challenges you know the validity

00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,730
of some of the questions we are

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,110
constantly reviewing them and just

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,340
because you think there's no right

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,780
answer they it doesn't mean there isn't

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,550
one the other thing is Proctor's are not

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,960
allowed to answer any questions about

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:23,000
the content of the exam and you know

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,150
this happens sometimes because you know

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,530
you'll have a proctor who's technical as

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:36,080
well we're gonna play dumb interpreter

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:37,820
for you but please you know if you do

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:44,860
think there is a problem with the exam

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:49,370
let us know so once you're done the exam

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:52,600
will get the results from view within 24

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:56,320
hours and I think they promised 98.5

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,760
results will show up within 24 hours

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,190
probably over the last 15 years we've

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,650
had to ask them where one of the exam

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,720
results for after three or four days and

00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,300
the candidates wondering why they

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,140
haven't received any any emails notice

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:16,030
from us but most of the time you'll get

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:24,850
an email from us within 24 hours either

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:27,620
congratulating you or so you'll get a

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:30,440
score report it'll tell you how you did

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:36,200
in the major areas as well as whether

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:41,060
you passed or not if you just won show

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,440
it yeah if you achieve the certification

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,750
as well you'll get a separate email

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,330
telling you about that as well right so

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,000
the first 101 exam won't get you

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:52,250
certified you get the 102 and then

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,080
you'll get the certification and they're

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,240
they're good for five years as well or

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,360
they're active for five years we never

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,300
expire

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,550
or delete them from the database it's

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,370
just after five years if you haven't

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:08,940
moved up the level or retaking the exam

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:20,160
which I'll get to how to avoid that

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:22,260
later we just mark it inactive yeah the

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,440
other thing is you don't have to take

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,170
the exams in order if you go and take

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,270
the level two exams and you pass them we

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,040
don't award certification until you go

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,140
and take the level one exams and pass

00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,490
those as well and then we'll issue both

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,110
at the same time quite frankly it's most

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,090
people are way more prepared for level

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,540
two because that's where the fun stuff

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:48,360
is I'll pick one it's kind of like you

00:30:45,540 --> 00:31:01,620
know taking algebra and boring subjects

00:30:48,360 --> 00:31:04,140
before you get to go for all of our

00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,420
professional certifications when it is

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,970
awarded we'll also mail out so do make

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:12,210
sure your registration has a real proper

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:14,640
snail mail address will mail out a

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:20,250
congratulations letter a full

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:27,900
certification paper that you can frame

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:30,770
or laminate or I'm sure they will and

00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,610
will also give you a wallet size card

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,610
for that certification as well

00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,700
if you don't receive it within a month

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,550
let us know double-check your address

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,540
and then let us know and we can always

00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:55,220
send it as well you can also download a

00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,220
PDF version of it while you're waiting

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,500
the other thing you'll notice if you go

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:06,140
and check your certification online is

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,680
there's some verification codes so if

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,270
you want to let your employer friends

00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,400
you know see that you really do have

00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,650
that certification you just have to let

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,350
them know your LPI ID and one of those

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:27,320
codes and they can see the service that

00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:30,860
you have and this is the URL to it LPI

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:34,880
dot org slash verify I believe if you

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,560
just go slash your ID slash that code so

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,420
you can just put the URL and people

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:51,560
don't have to enter it it'll it'll work

00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:55,640
as well as the form so so after five

00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,800
years your certifications inactive we

00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,920
you know used to recommend recertifying

00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,780
every two and a half to three years or

00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,370
moving up level which is actually way

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,290
better than just proving that you knew

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,230
how to do you still know how to do what

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,970
you know how to do for three years ago

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:13,670
but we actually are in the process of

00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,240
changing our member our model for

00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,480
governance

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,060
so like the PMI the project management

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,930
institute if you know them or the ISC

00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:25,520
two that do the CISSP certification

00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,680
holders are the ones that are going to

00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,510
be the members of or eligible to be

00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,480
members for the nonprofit and they'll be

00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:34,190
the ones that get to vote for the board

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,620
anyone could be a board member because

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,110
we need more than just tech guys you

00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,780
know on a board to make it functional

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:49,940
but it's the certification holders to

00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:52,160
get to choose them so if you are if any

00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,370
of you are certified and you don't want

00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,460
to retake the test I mean that vote we

00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,220
will be using a more professional method

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,780
for maintaining your credentials we're

00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,970
just calling it that PDU system

00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,860
professional development units so it

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,100
will involve you know continuing

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:13,070
education work experience whether it's

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:15,410
you know for pay or volunteer work or

00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:19,270
you know contributing new knowledge to

00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:24,140
to your field you know writing books

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:29,930
blogs articles online well as volunteer

00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:31,820
stuff mentoring people you know study

00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:35,150
groups helping organize study groups

00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,940
things like that those things show that

00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:41,150
you're not only just actively using what

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,250
you certified in but like most

00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,870
professions you're going beyond the

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,030
certification which is really just a

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,190
minimum like this is the minimum you

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:52,730
should know to really be a professional

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,380
with these tools in this field but you

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,720
know just like any other profession when

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,650
there's a doctor or a lawyer we expect

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,400
you to go

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,400
beyond that and so do your employers

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,400
it is a tough exam a lot of people get

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,620
offended when they don't pass and

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,840
usually it's because they've been using

00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,970
Linux for five or six or eight years and

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:25,770
they figured I know all this stuff

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:29,760
already and they just wing it and most

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:34,800
the time that's not a good approach to

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,020
take in the exams if you do fail an exam

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,270
you have to wait a week before you can

00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,120
take it again and if you fail it a

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:46,140
second time you have to wait 90 days and

00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,390
then 90 days 90 days because there are

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,910
some guys that will try and just retake

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,550
the exam over and over you know once a

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,290
day and they just throwing their money

00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,940
away and then trying to brute-force

00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,150
something that they just don't have the

00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:02,970
knowledge for yet so we try and slow

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:06,000
people down from you know same sort of

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,410
thing in a casino right we don't we

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,960
don't want your money we want you guys

00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,160
to learn this stuff and and then we want

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:18,690
to help you prove it to the world that

00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:20,940
you do all this so that's about it if

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,010
you've got any questions we can answer

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,190
them now if you'd like to look at some

00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,500
of the details of the various

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,710
certification exams we can look through

00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,790
that discuss some of the topics if if

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:39,000
you like but otherwise I'll let you guys

00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:41,940
go early I did bring some discount codes

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,660
so if anyone is interested in taking the

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,000
exams before September this year there's

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,370
some 50% discount codes to basically

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,190
just cover their hard cost of delivering

00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:59,210
the exams so don't forget to take some

00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,210
of you if you're interested

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:10,060
so historically we divided the work that

00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,640
world into two sides the skills

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:17,470
assessment the testing and the training

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:20,440
and we don't do any training it's you

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:23,110
know the firewall that you you don't

00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,090
cross right because otherwise there's a

00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,060
trust issue right we don't want people

00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,580
thinking that we're just doing this to

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:34,320
get training revenue or something and so

00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,030
yeah we're just the test now that said

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,370
there is that sort of middle ground

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,340
which is the learning materials right

00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,480
the courseware and things like that

00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:46,180
historically we stayed away from that as

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,060
well we relied on partners you know

00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,640
whether it was a Riley or Cybex Wiley

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,410
you name it or commercial vendors that

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,940
are doing corporate training course

00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:59,890
where that worked the first decade but

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,560
we're now at the you know the tipping

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,030
point where everybody realized yeah we

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,950
gotta learn this stuff and so

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,720
everybody's trying to set up education

00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,120
programs for this and having a lot of

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,220
difficulty so last year the board

00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,750
changed the policy and we're now

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,840
creating a base set of learning

00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:19,060
materials that will that be you know

00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,820
free to use for any student that wants

00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,110
to and then our partners as well would

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,440
be able to use that in commercial

00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:28,090
settings and we're doing it that way so

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,920
that you know we have a relationship

00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,690
with the people that are using it for

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,370
teaching others so that we can make sure

00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:38,290
they are aware of updates and things

00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:41,560
like that if you if you go to learning

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:47,100
LPI org that's where we're going to be

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:50,140
releasing that the structure for them is

00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:56,830
remember there's 60 questions on the

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:58,870
exam so in the actually let me so you'll

00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,460
see it's broken down into some major

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:04,480
topic areas and then there's further

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:07,839
subdivided alright so for instance

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,700
and let's take this managing shared

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,730
libraries you'll see it's got a

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:15,000
weighting of one that means there's one

00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:20,770
question related to that topic area on

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,119
each exam and again these are the things

00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,950
you should focus on while you're

00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,470
studying you're welcome to learn more

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:30,970
but these are the things we'll be asking

00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:33,099
you about and so for those learning

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:36,369
materials for each weight of the exam

00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:39,099
we're going to write one lesson plan is

00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:41,410
structured very academically because a

00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,430
lot of it this is actually an exercise

00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,400
that's coming out of our academic

00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:48,720
advisory committee and so each each

00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,369
lesson plan is fairly standalone

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,490
there'll be about four or five pages of

00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:57,280
content and then another four or so

00:39:54,490 --> 00:40:00,400
pages of guided exercises so questions

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,470
and exercises with the answers and then

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,910
for anybody that gets past that you know

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,560
so if they're in a school setting and

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,000
some guy just runs off and gets it all

00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,670
done well everybody else is still

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,319
working on it there's then going to be

00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,810
another set of exercises without any

00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:15,520
answers which we encourage everyone to

00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,339
do because honestly that's where you're

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,200
gonna do your most learning it's going

00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:22,869
off to look for answers that you just

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:27,280
start accumulating site knowledge which

00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:27,700
will come in handy later that answer

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,589
your question

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:35,859
sorry that was a long answer yeah yeah

00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:37,900
yeah that's yeah the we don't tell them

00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:39,790
how to structure their education

00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,730
programs I mean we sometimes help them

00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:45,760
set them up but yeah I mean they you

00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,980
know however they you know that pedagogy

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,630
word you know however they think they

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,630
should set up their their programs

00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:04,640
yes in a while on our exam development

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,640
list which last time I checked him eight

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,220
years ago there was over a thousand guys

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,230
sorry a thousand opinions on that

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,790
mailing list you know quite often

00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,710
they'll look at this and they'll say hey

00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,150
this is all out of order you shouldn't

00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,050
be teaching it this way and then we

00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:23,480
point out this is not the this is not a

00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,640
teaching thing this is just a list of

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,280
what you need to know and you structure

00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,940
it an order it any way you want for

00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,650
instance when you know I've classes you

00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:37,190
know in corporate settings and you know

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:40,040
some lugs and I usually leave the

00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,420
installation for last because that

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,330
actually requires a lot of knowledge

00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:47,210
about the hard disks and partitions and

00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:49,790
formatting file systems and you name it

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,640
that why do you start with

00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,350
hey let's install Linux right better to

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,020
learn all the components and then the

00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:58,640
installation is easy right not to

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,280
mention if you mess up your installation

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,380
you now spent the next two days trying

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:12,460
to figure it like install Linux instead

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:15,620
of actually learning all the content so

00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,300
we are actually if any of you guys know

00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:21,140
this material well we're constantly

00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:24,290
looking for more writers to help it is a

00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,050
paid gig we do pay people for this and

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:29,120
it's broken up in very chunk able bits

00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:33,050
so people get to cherry-pick what they

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:37,220
what they teach and here's a sample

00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:42,190
actually of one of the lesson plans the

00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:45,290
in it we're still working on everything

00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,910
but I'm told that a significant portion

00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:50,570
of its gonna be released sometime around

00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,280
June but by the end of the year we want

00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,710
to have full coverage for all of our

00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,210
exams and then afterwards we won't

00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:01,430
release a new certification or anything

00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:02,780
with this content as well and we're

00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,340
starting with the lower level of stuff

00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,300
first so Linux essentials that's why

00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,430
this exam

00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,610
essentials Linux essentials and I'll

00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,500
pick one we'll cover first usually

00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,420
because that's the one that people need

00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,090
the most help with all right quite often

00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,590
I'll pick two guys they don't they often

00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,180
don't go take courses they just start

00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,620
learning it on their own because you

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,990
know the bootstrap their knowledge

00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:27,890
enough that they can deal with problems

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:32,090
as they go and you know Stack Exchange

00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:33,650
or you know redhead or wherever they can

00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,110
go and ask some questions and there's

00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,730
lots of people that oh I've actually

00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,110
I've learned that the best way to get

00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,210
any answer is to go on there and say

00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,710
this sucks

00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,380
well I can't even do this and then

00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:48,470
people will go yeah whereas if you just

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:54,170
go and say hey how did I do this nobody

00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:56,740
wants to answer those questions you get

00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,740
some answers

00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:11,170
any other questions are the my email

00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,580
address is not on there but if you do

00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:16,180
have some questions you're welcome to

00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:20,140
email me it's not at LPI org well

00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:24,390
officially it's m RI c e m rice at OPI

00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:29,740
org because I had that address before we

00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:31,960
established our email policy I just in

00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:36,850
case you know someone from 20 years ago

00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,790
wants to email you never know long-lost

00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,690
friends know someone that went to you

00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:47,530
know we've got what we call a good job

00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:49,600
in consulting and stuff there's highs

00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,270
and lows and so a good job stands for

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,590
get out of debt

00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,540
yeah so they need go back and be a

00:44:53,590 --> 00:45:01,180
consultant again after a few years once

00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:09,850
your your spouse recovered I'm not

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:11,560
triggering any nerves here yeah was

00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,540
there anything from this presentation

00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,180
you were expecting that we didn't do

00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,990
quite often people come here wanting to

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:23,200
you know thinking it's going to be a

00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:25,780
class and there's just way too much to

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,369
cover even on Linux essentials to make

00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,410
that sort of exercise worthwhile so

00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:31,750
usually we'll use this to try and help

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:34,080
organize some study groups or things

00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,080
like that

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,050
through view yeah actually here let's do

00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:56,109
a live demo of that go to view and so

00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:58,599
technically view is our partner they

00:45:56,109 --> 00:46:01,090
promise to deliver our exams everywhere

00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,010
they can and then they set up the

00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,280
relationships with training senators and

00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:15,180
universities military bases you know

00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:15,180
random hot dog vendors that's today

00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:24,849
so you can see the exams here although

00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:31,690
they're also listed down here oops here

00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:36,070
click on find a test center oh okay they

00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:38,920
really mean it alright there are test

00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,940
centers here yeah and and actually if

00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,550
any of you are going some of the

00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,720
universities here as well through the

00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,540
WorldSkills do you guys know the

00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,030
WorldSkills competition they actually

00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:51,070
use our L pick two as the basis for

00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,420
their linux competition I didn't know

00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:56,619
that until two years ago but they've

00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,849
been doing it for a long time and we

00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:00,160
were actually talking to some of the

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:05,020
universities here about helping them set

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,670
up for that competition but you know

00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:11,140
nonprofits are sometimes slow-moving

00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:13,210
trains and so and we get there well

00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,650
we're also trying we're also trying to

00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,260
convince them to add some the DevOps

00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,700
topics to you know and so are some of

00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,230
the people in the world skills you know

00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,290
the tech guys yeah it's time to change

00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:26,200
this around a little bit and fortunately

00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:30,250
we managed to you know match there's a

00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:38,230
guy stand and you know our DevOps

00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:40,920
certifications but yeah once once this

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,920
sites back up

00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:51,380
I'd be surprised if there were fewer

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:55,160
than five places in in Singapore that

00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:57,650
you could take the test and regardless

00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,150
we're talking to Mario we're hoping that

00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,790
we'll be able to do some paper versions

00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,440
of the tests here as well and also

00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:06,260
reduce the cost for people all right

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,770
well in that case what I'm going to call

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,000
it a day

00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:12,440
and I do have some voucher codes for

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,300
people if they if they want a few

00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:20,000
additional ones that'll get them the

00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:24,140
exams for half off I went really high

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,120
tech and bunch of slips for everybody so

00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:28,850
anyway thank you very much I actually

00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,160
appreciate everyone showing up quite

00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:36,160
often this is voted the most boring

00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:49,010
presentation of any conference but hey

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:51,580
yeah anything worth doing is alright

00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,580
