Title: Bare Metal Provisioning in Data Center, including Network Switches by Steven Shiau
Publication date: 2019-03-29
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Kernel & Platform

Bare-metal provisioning in data center normally covers the server, computing, and storage nodes. Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) is an open source initiative that defines an open “install environment” for bare metal network switches [1]. ONIE allows users to have a choice among different network operating systems, and also to keep the network configurations. In this talk we introduce the way to use Clonezilla [2] to deploy the systems for the whole cabinet, including the ONIE network switches. This presentation will give you a picture about how to fast deploy the system environment you need.

the news oh okay thank you for coming

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,790
okay

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,410
give talk about it okay payment or

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,920
provisioning in there are Center

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,650
including network switches okay there is

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,640
a joint project I mean this Walker is

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:30,179
joined by on Jersey and I care not

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:31,920
Western University in us okay almost at

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,840
the same time we also presented without

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,719
in Open Compute Project summit

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,210
okay so let's put the basic idea for a

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,600
system developing and provisioning so

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,840
nobody you you need a tour tool for to

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,750
use for the like this a single machine

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,079
backup and restore or you may need to

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,480
deploy to copy to the Chrome mini USB

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:04,439
flash drive just like a one machine and

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:07,170
many disks in a machine you you have a

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:11,070
cluster and then you want to deploy an

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,540
image temperate machine from an image

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,110
you found the temporal machine and too

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,700
many computers that's the scenario one

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,670
of the scenario in a computer classroom

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,950
so you you need this counter in Chrome

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:28,140
as one of this kind of solution help you

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:31,680
to do something like this so it is

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,470
suppose Mena's make always windows BST

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,000
previously something please so that's

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:42,890
the a spectrum for pornea

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,720
yeah you can see many users and from

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:53,689
2004 until 2018 8 18 years it's about 19

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,210
million downloads but until recently

00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:59,100
actually still in a machine noon if we

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,280
want to do a system deployment or

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,439
prevention for a server node computing

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,390
node and the storage node is okay

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,819
because it's no community based on our

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,870
linear system and the inner season is

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:18,330
Warsong miss can

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:22,230
wrong but for us which is always issue

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,019
because later we will have more about

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,170
the switch but as you know that the

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:32,400
switch is a not in in the past before

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,709
it's only a proprietary solution and one

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,440
vendor they have a hard way or they have

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,750
learned they were resistant and then

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,379
they have their own application so it's

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,049
not open technology and people can not

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:49,859
you know have your own solution you want

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:54,150
to turn onto something the the idea the

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:56,700
idea came from Ikea they because they

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,340
are naval centers and they need to some

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,840
to do some more tests especially a war

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:08,370
rate in the world wreck and they can

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,940
before this kind of not but but because

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,430
it's an as I mentioned it's an NIC wall

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,030
center so they also have to some

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,160
experience about a newest which and

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,590
that's sometimes that's a headache they

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,870
have to you know put different networks

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,639
which and they have to buy more for some

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,910
because they just want to tune something

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,930
or some different network appearances

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,730
and Antonella

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:40,950
so until the only only networks which is

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:44,730
a variable before it's impossible to do

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:48,959
this kind of or provisioning but I'm

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,660
wondering anyone here has anyone has a

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,069
only switch or familiar with Sony's

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,870
switch if so yeah so you must be

00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:00,510
familiar and administrator for Sam's in

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,599
Ireland yeah so the only switch actually

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,930
as I mentioned before it was a latest

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,489
model one vendor they have their own

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,720
applications neighboring system and

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:17,010
their own hardware so you cannot you

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:21,060
cannot like a computer PC you can have

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,370
your own never your own a persistent and

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,440
you can install your own package you can

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,690
tune a system it's not easy to do

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,260
these kind of things in a pest with only

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,920
it's open at networking so the hardware

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,160
maybe a fender see and the new opera in

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,530
sir maybe found a Fender B and

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,400
application maybe from finder a so it's

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:48,360
because it's open so you can do many

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,960
things only is actually create spiral

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,730
humorous network in 2012 and later yah

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,630
it was a tapped by the Open Compute

00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:03,150
Project in 2013 an oven computer project

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:06,060
is funded by I think funny bunny

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,510
Facebook because they have another data

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,700
center they need to wrong you know no

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,650
service and with the open copy approach

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,440
a lot of fainter they join and they

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:20,370
provided this kind of open hardware open

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,680
solution so it's much easier for for and

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,470
just like a PC everyone can join and

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:30,180
like IBM PC Santa Mary's so if the pair

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,550
except a metal high pass solution and of

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,250
course like open source of a never open

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,410
hardware so it's much easier now if we

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,640
want to just like we from the machine

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,400
every system we have a mirror which we

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:48,000
can install our own operating system in

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,410
this kind of oneís switch and let me

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,190
show you that actually is not cheap this

00:05:52,410 --> 00:06:00,169
kind of sweetie because it's used in all

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,169
tech machine Newton there are centers so

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,120
amazing you can see that if we search oh

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,430
nice

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,510
switch and you can find out like that is

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:16,430
the kind of edge car it's about 48 I

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:20,070
think for the airport and take the a bit

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,160
the price is about forty four thousand

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,440
US dollars and like this this kind of is

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:32,760
like maybe this one for 40 gigabit

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:35,970
ethernet it's about ten thousand US

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,150
dollars so that's expensive to go

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,150
actually

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:48,629
okay let me back to my size so because

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:52,080
he's opened so there may be no no it's a

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:55,710
variable so like these there are some at

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,770
least some some providers support so

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:03,270
that some are really expensive but some

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:06,000
alpha so and they are free variable you

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:10,409
and you can own you can have a wrong

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,770
solution like this here many they

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:16,440
provide support it's all based on

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,080
different kind of operation like this

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,909
one's for Debian from Debian and this

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,729
one we found till you found the BST

00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:27,569
something olives and they because it's

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:33,360
just like that only switch is just like

00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:36,990
a PC so the Nina's can run on this kind

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,110
of machine so you can even see that most

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:45,870
of architecture layer support like it's

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:50,569
86 PowerPC ARM architecture and let's

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:53,550
talk more about the inside of Bologna in

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:57,210
its like a PC by nature is not really

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,089
the putting sequences and like nah it's

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,440
not like a the PC we have so in the

00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:06,379
beginning of course it still have per

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,379
daughter so this part is the same but

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:14,839
the second part is only in interphase so

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:18,830
the first time if there's no race no

00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:23,789
noise is ID on inside the only so which

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:26,729
it will try to find installer may be

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:30,479
found a fresh drive may be found a TV

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:33,510
server HTTP server then it will get the

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,390
the installer then start install the

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,180
network operating system in the only

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:45,390
switch not for the first time and when

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:47,819
they the the only switch the net was our

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,850
incision is installed in the honest

00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:53,700
which many were bypassed the only mentor

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:59,220
they put into the never in season that's

00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,620
the basic post sequence and now I know

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,080
it's interface actually provide another

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,590
provide additional interface for example

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,690
it's provided restoring its provider are

00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,500
installing and is private rescue or

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,630
operating mod so when you want to

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,740
reinstall the noise you can use the

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,540
existing annoys but choose to reinstall

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,570
the operating system

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,850
ok and special special here there's a

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:32,010
rescue mode you can enter a rescue mode

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:35,640
and to tune or to modify no system if

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:38,670
you want not as the basic idea and with

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,400
this one rescue model actually that data

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:46,980
we will show how to use cornea to to

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,110
enter the risk to enter a rescue mode

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,770
and switch to corneal I then you can

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,060
deploy or pick up your only switch

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:59,880
that's the basic idea

00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:02,460
so here remember the the the put in

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,200
sequence right for the first time the

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:10,830
Pirotta or enter only but in place a

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:17,610
noise then you have to switch to rescue

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:20,480
mode however because it's not like the

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:25,950
installer for the only it's not like a

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:29,550
regular ISO file or something like you

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,910
used to install Debian or bomb - so you

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,870
is a laser a special mode spiritual form

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,840
a Tony

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,000
for the Installer on own is in solar so

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:44,450
here we have to convert from here live

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,980
ISO to the file and the file sure is a

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,470
self-extracting put-putting file for

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,100
owning we have a command and we can you

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,170
can come

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:58,290
comfort the Kamiya ISO to this kind of

00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:03,290
fire then with this sequence you can

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:07,740
assign the only switch to put from this

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:09,360
image then switch to cornea life so

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,879
that's it effects the idea and then

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,509
after that it's just like a normal PC or

00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:18,689
you can pick up reading so so so this is

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:22,370
some of screenshot this one is a tale as

00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:25,439
40 40 40 48 um

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,959
only switch a lot some of the screen

00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:31,589
shop is little bit small I explained to

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,410
you released like a crop and you can see

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:38,220
later I have I will do some other live

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,819
demo and you can see someone put put a

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,800
lotta put menu and the one I mentioned

00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:47,639
you know I know I know it's interface is

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,480
provide a rescue mode and reinstall in

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:54,509
something like that and this is about a

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,329
the command you enter in a rescue mode

00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:00,089
and you you can switch to chrony alive

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:02,730
okay so that's the background and about

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:06,389
a screenshot so here i will do a

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:10,230
demonstration about this so let me spend

00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:12,990
the first because as i mentioned we need

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:18,059
to download corny alive then comfort

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:21,059
convert to the cept self-extracting put

00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:24,149
in five okay so last one pal here

00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,089
because I didn't bring the heavy the

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:30,319
heavy no nice Russia now I'm really

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:33,000
happy I think is about 10 or 15

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:35,699
kilograms now that's really heavy so

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,790
actually I will use the Roger pass

00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:45,959
virtual machine to simulate this kind of

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:48,990
only switch and in in the only project

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,680
Teja you happen you can talk you can

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:58,410
chrome the only project then you can

00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:01,250
create the the ISO file for for the

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:06,209
virtual machine then you can enter the

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:09,629
only rescue mode okay that's the the the

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:13,559
basic step is very normal

00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:15,929
just get chrome and in sort of in Debian

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,610
you can just install the essential

00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:20,299
package

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:24,470
then you could make this rescue I saw

00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:28,089
then you file will be ready so I I will

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:35,839
prepare I have prepared I so fired and

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:38,239
and because for honest which I maintain

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,049
its daikyo PC by actually is a header

00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:43,660
this is there's no VGA port for

00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:47,329
switching normally it's only you know

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:51,559
serial console serial port so it's the

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:53,600
same this the one you the right sofa you

00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:56,600
create actually this no VGA driver

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,369
inside and still you have to use the

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,129
serial console to connect to the virtual

00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:03,259
machine so that's the basic idea so they

00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:06,829
thought what these are preparation I

00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:09,470
have I were to and we can enter sq motor

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:12,170
for only then switch it to chromia then

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:21,799
to the backup or restore okay here

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:27,919
I want to a demonstration okay

00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:33,079
this virtual part I have and also you

00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:36,589
can see that here lots of all the one I

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:44,929
mentioned is a only recovery or rescue I

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:49,669
survive not I mentioned we have made ok

00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:52,069
because it's I think it's check maybe 20

00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:55,730
means to create this ISO file so I want

00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:59,029
to this year I have prepared so if I

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:02,239
right now I put into the virtual machine

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:05,499
it's like a the only switch and you can

00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:08,360
see that exactly something I release but

00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:10,399
as you can see you see just grub and

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,160
nothing nothing happen because it's

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,610
entered headless you had to use the

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:21,619
serial console to connect so here I

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:27,919
prepare some of the comment okay let me

00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:29,810
turn it off first then we can okay so

00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:35,029
it's again is friend

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:37,970
mean the first uh-oh

00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:41,090
bring on the battery anyway the first

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,160
one is a we compare the cornea iso file

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,230
first you have to download a kernel

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,420
chrome leader I survived on our website

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,660
I will just show you because it is take

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:56,420
a few minutes to download so I won't

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:59,950
spend too much time on this oona and a

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,950
new working what's wrong

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,950
anyway

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:15,470
anyway you can tangle Laconia I saw from

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,940
the cornea dialga a wise once is ready

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:22,259
for the cornea project that you had to

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:25,319
install Laconia fire cornea package then

00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:29,130
laser come in in inside cornea package

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:32,339
is called or OCS I saw to only so with

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,420
this comment is more convert no I so to

00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:45,329
set it straight him put him fire they me

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:48,889
to this okay here I have done oh one

00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:51,690
file per actually adding to another

00:16:48,889 --> 00:17:00,740
price but it's fine you can see that

00:16:51,690 --> 00:17:05,309
okay so let me compare the ISO file -

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:07,650
yeah it will take 1 to 2 minutes to

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:12,059
convert to resize of art because it will

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,260
extract the ISO file and repackaging to

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:17,309
serve it straight

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,039
Tim put in file actually is inside

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:25,620
everything into the initial Ren Ren file

00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:31,400
so here yeah it's taken the total file

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:36,240
size may be 280 megabyte so another

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:41,520
maybe turn in second no yeah 20 seconds

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:44,909
ungodly and and you will see it will

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:49,919
convert the PIM PI and data we can put

00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:53,340
into the HTTP server for for my let's

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,909
hop III Rana HTTP server so the file

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,789
will be put on the HTTP server and the

00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:05,179
only switch can connect to the HTTP

00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:05,179
server and get up in Storify

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:19,809
oh yeah so so it's done and you can see

00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:24,190
that there's a cell is trading port file

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:32,350
ready that's here okay so we can call

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:42,099
copy this file to the Apache talking

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:44,349
Manute okay so we have the fire here and

00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:49,269
I make it shorter that would be easier

00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:54,220
to type okay so once it's done then we

00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:59,220
can pack to the only switch first I use

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,220
the serial console come in to connect to

00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:07,389
the Oni switch by because it's not on so

00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:17,470
right now is still is the file it's not

00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:24,759
the nice list so okay here all right

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:29,229
is let me - it's okay because you didn't

00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:31,899
see the now put menu here you can see

00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:35,220
that's the only important menu first is

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:37,749
because the ISO file we have created is

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:42,249
especially for recovery for a rescue

00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:46,479
model so Pat Evo Rapa menu is in only in

00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:51,190
rescue so here we entered a rescue mode

00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:54,190
for the Oni switch okay you yeah so it

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,289
it because it's quite small so right now

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,799
we are in the only recovery mode and

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:05,979
with this actually you can see this IP

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:08,649
address here okay and you can see

00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:11,679
actually because it's in a virtual path

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:15,460
so by the vol the Gateway for my machine

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:20,349
is this private IP address then right

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,880
now we can use this command only

00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:23,679
I know its installed

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,980
as I mentioned this fight is for the

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:35,080
soul in solo 5 so you can use to become

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:37,570
into convert to Korean life okay

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,660
so here you can see is connect to the

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:44,280
HTTP server then get a not only self

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,440
extracting port file then you watch a

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:51,100
torah checksum check in okay

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,650
then enter switch use KCC to switch to

00:20:51,100 --> 00:21:00,960
that distribution then right now is

00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:00,960
enter the normal Chrome we are live mod

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,640
just curious anyone use cron we are live

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,940
here people okay okay so later you will

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,360
see the familiar the interface so

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:23,500
suppose you choose the keyboard layout

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,620
and you can choose to start from your

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:30,130
life and for for samurai I will just do

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:32,530
some of the menu just show some more

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,470
remaining part I will now because it

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:37,870
will take a few minutes to to run so

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:43,210
here we can choose to several image and

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:45,960
we can choose to no I can choose to

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:49,419
serve in SSH server something Aries and

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:55,350
Kara Beatrice the HH server is like they

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:55,350
stand apart okay so I can use this

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,430
okay so lots of imagery repository I

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,300
have we prepared its analyzer jisub

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:12,740
it's actually server then then you can

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:16,010
start to save the Nahor only switch so I

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,050
won't do that anymore because you will

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:21,680
check maybe five minutes or ten minutes

00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:25,070
and yeah you compress the whole system

00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,620
to reach a server and you can prepare

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,650
different kind of an OS and you can take

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,230
a also image and you are immediately

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,300
pass sorry when you want to switch to

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,970
different kind of annoys you with this

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,300
disk animator that you can switch you

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:45,080
are only switch to different annoys and

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:48,500
a different configuration so that's the

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:54,080
end of my talk and a demonstration and I

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:56,090
will show you some other yeah I will

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,150
pull this side and come here website so

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,400
you can get it with you but some of ya

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:05,150
know you are or you can just Google is

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,490
all open document so it's not difficult

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:16,490
to find any kind of the document

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:19,280
reference okay any questions great easy

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,170
to understand right okay actually how

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,760
many of you have used network switches

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:28,280
in the lab I guess many of you right

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,070
okay I have and I've gotta say there's

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,600
two of us here and I can say that all of

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,120
them have been running on closed source

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,520
software so actually using open source

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,700
software that you can access and control

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,990
it's a big game changer and of course

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,840
you can put your security issues or run

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,330
diamonds or whatever and it's then not

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,220
just a black box you can't control so I

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,300
think that's a game changer really yes

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:59,140
only distribution yeah okay let's thank

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:03,479
Stephen for him talk okay thank you

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,479
