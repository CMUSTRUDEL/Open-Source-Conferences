Bare-metal provisioning in data center normally covers the server, computing, and storage nodes. Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) is an open source initiative that defines an open “install environment” for bare metal network switches [1]. ONIE allows users to have a choice among different network operating systems, and also to keep the network configurations. In this talk we introduce the way to use Clonezilla [2] to deploy the systems for the whole cabinet, including the ONIE network switches. This presentation will give you a picture about how to fast deploy the system environment you need.
