This talk will begin with a brief introduction to the problems which revolve around the software build space from the perspective of the developer and the perspective of the system integrator. Then we will present the solutions we've come up with in the BuildStream project; which is now used to build the base Flatpak runtimes and GNOME releases. As this will be a brief session, we will try to discuss the build space in the abstract and hope to raise awareness through the Q&A session.
