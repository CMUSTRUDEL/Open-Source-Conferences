An internet kiosk is a special use case. A single computer is shared by an indefinite number of users. Lots of security concerns arise. In Asia and elsewhere multiple non-latin languages have to be supported. We decided to create a custom lightweight distribution, Meilix and a generator web app that allows you to preconfigure an ISO with the wallpaper and desktop settings in place.

so the topic which I will want to talk

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,790
about here is a building customized

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,450
Linux based operating system using

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,250
Malik's script and I am recognized by

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,609
Arun Kumar I'm a final year

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,180
undergraduate student with Electrical

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:27,060
Engineering as my core and I did G saga

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:30,900
in 2017 2018 I was a mentor in DCI 1718

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,110
code hate 17 and 18 you can find me with

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,110
mitsuharu not get out I'll Facebook

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,489
LinkedIn github with the same handle

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,329
meets two theorem so Malik's which I

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,719
used for building the OS so if we subset

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,829
it so Mele stands for beautiful and Alex

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,399
loving it

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,489
so it's like an operating system which

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,559
is beautiful and everyone loves it so

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,660
the basic qualities of Malick's it's

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,040
based on alex QT as the desktop

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,020
environment it's based on Ubuntu

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,600
architecture the basic philosophy behind

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,150
this it's very lightweight as compared

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,590
to others and the thing that makes

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,000
different from other Linux distribution

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,560
is that you are able to customize it

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,140
talking customizing of Malick's is

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,729
through customizing and altering the

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,799
codes and you get a pre configuration in

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,840
Malek's there is a proper documentation

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,210
with the help of which you are able to

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,210
make certain changes in the operating

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,549
system there is a system lock feature

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,780
which will be describing then in the

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,149
upcoming slides so let's talk about

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,950
Malick's generator so I explained what

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,399
is malloc smell exists just an operating

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,290
system and we can make changes into it

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,799
with the help of changing and altering

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,770
the code and there is a web app known as

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,250
Malik's generator so Malik's generator

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,740
is just a web app and it is made for all

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,560
the users out there they are not able to

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,500
make changes in the code to make to

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,510
customize their own OS so we created

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,560
Malik's generator with the help of which

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,890
one just

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,310
to go through this particular form and

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,290
make changes to this particular form and

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,930
whatever changes he or she made it will

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,630
get implemented in that particular Linux

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,640
OS so you don't need to customize the

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,310
code don't need to changes the code and

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,280
at the end of the day you are able to

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,560
create your own customized Linux OS so

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,260
let me go through the form quickly first

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,920
you need to have your email address on

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,850
which you have to put your email address

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,069
and there you get an ISO link at the end

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,900
of the build you have to name your

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,970
distribution so as you create your own

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,850
distribution you want it to name

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,739
something special for yourself there is

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,950
a browser home page there is a browser

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,049
search engine so if you selected some

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,090
browser to get installed in it so you

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,480
want that particular link to be the home

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,670
page of that browser or that particular

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,110
link from which all over all the strings

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,569
will be searched that will be the

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,180
browser search engine and there is a

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:21,030
32-bit as well as 64-bit support by

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,299
default if you didn't check this button

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,150
it would be 32 it would be 64-bit and if

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,459
you check it you will get the OS into 34

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,079
bit so we have support for about 32 as

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,180
well as 64 bits and there are some

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,890
queries over here like notifications

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,970
screensaver sleep modules so if you

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,630
check those ticks so it would be like

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:48,090
you'd be able to see those features in

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,000
that and there is a third-party

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,000
software's like chromium Firefox so if a

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,980
person just want that particular package

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,500
in it he will check it and that only

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,250
package will be installed there is a

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,040
logo so you have to upload an SVG where

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,760
you will you will find that particular

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,380
logo for that OS there is a wallpaper so

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,019
you just need to upload a background

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,200
image that will be set as a wallpaper

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,180
over the OS and there is the dexstar

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,579
file so you can upload here a zip file

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,919
are a bunch of files that will be

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,260
present on the desktop click on the

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,850
build button wait for 10 minutes and you

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,680
will get a link on your

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:34,890
email with a ISO then you can run it in

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,800
VM live booted and you will see all

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,480
those features which you created here

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,150
will be present and then operate

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,080
operating system so basically what

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,050
happens here talking about a workshop

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,840
talking about a conference we have to

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,820
set up the computer which is going to

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,590
project or the computer which is going

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,630
to be used in the workshop with those

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,140
particular settings which is needed for

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,330
that workshop our conference so just

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,780
consider a scenario there's a workshop

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,970
and the person is going to have around a

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,730
hundred participants in the workshop so

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,490
a particular software like something is

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,550
going to be needed throughout throughout

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,320
all the computers so that single person

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,660
has to set up all those hundred

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,310
computers with that particular software

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,270
and that particular settings in the

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:31,710
software our Malick's can be a solution

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:34,320
for him so he can go through go through

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,470
a single time set up he can use Malick's

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,690
to generate that particular I so with

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,240
all those desirable customizable

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,200
settings which he wants all through all

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,690
those computers so we have future plans

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,270
how to set up all those computers we can

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:54,660
use ansible now this ideas not yet

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:58,590
implemented this is just a prospective

00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,900
to to implement in the future Malick's

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,380
we can use ansible and with the help of

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,170
SSH we can put it run on all the

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,640
computers throughout so going through

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:14,760
all the so this is a variances snapshot

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,660
so Malick's generator was like this whew

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:21,120
just one year before it's around six

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:26,640
months before and currently it's like

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,500
this so Malick's gives us a Malick's

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,040
generator gives us power to customize

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,020
the OS so we use Travis in the

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,120
background in the dough in those 10

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,160
minutes Malik generator triggers that

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,169
particular Malick's repository and

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,599
Travis build it and

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:49,110
plot it on github we use a SendGrid to

00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:52,499
send the ISO link users can upload

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,599
wallpapers setup packages and customize

00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:58,680
it and the ISO will be mailed to the

00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:01,379
user so in the last year sock I went

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,779
through lots of milestone but one of the

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:08,069
important milestone is that before that

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:10,379
it's just 32-bit but now the system most

00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:14,879
of the machines are 64-bit and they

00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:18,120
required that particular 64-bit OS so we

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:24,629
are able to convert it into 64-bit just

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,580
this year only ok so the takeaways for

00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:29,310
Malick's generator is that we are able

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,849
to generate our own customized Linux

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:37,439
distribution in around 10 to 15 minutes

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:40,849
even with our mobile phone also we can

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,319
generate OS for conferences summits and

00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:49,259
workshops with all the desirable

00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:52,979
settings we can likewise our people one

00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:56,159
of my friend just saw my computer and he

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:58,439
was just impressed by my workspace most

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,229
of the developers are here they must

00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,870
want to show their own computers to our

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,839
their friends or they may get impressed

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:11,279
by seeing their workspace and they say

00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:13,939
wow how do you do that what's what next

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,460
of flavor you are using what is that

00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:20,009
screensaver what is that

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,919
terminal that you are using so you can

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,020
make all those changes and you can

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:31,039
generate an ISO and distribute it to

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:34,289
your friend say for future so you set up

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,810
your own way of working on in an

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:39,930
workspace in your computer but somehow

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:44,699
you find some bug and you have to shut

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:48,120
have to remove all the things and reset

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,519
the operating system so it will be it

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,130
will be back is straight to the original

00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,310
version and you have to

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,990
again start with the he start with the

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,830
fresh operating system you have to setup

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,870
all those things in that so you can set

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,890
up your own operating system and then

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,950
save it in the ISO format and again when

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,740
you find some bugs something you don't

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,390
need to go through the proper operating

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,340
system you can install that particular

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,030
ISO and it will have all those

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,550
customizable settings so there is few

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,040
ideas that I would I would like my

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,210
fellow developers to implement so we can

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,440
use in Siebel we can use docker image so

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,570
now today

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,900
Malick's is only usable to generate an

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:40,290
ISO image so what we are thinking we can

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,530
use virtual machine images we can use

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:48,000
docker container for Bev based interface

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:51,900
so the idea behind is that we can use an

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,840
link we can use a link and with the help

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:59,730
of which the person just go to the link

00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,680
and find that we find an opera way to

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,870
operate that operating system on that

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,630
particular link and it will have all

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,180
those features which which is given by

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,750
which is made customized by some other

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,600
user so is suppose that I give you link

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,720
and there is a contract there is a

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,010
workshop and a person is there who just

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,540
distributed a link and all those people

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,710
directly go to the link with the help of

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,140
internet or Internet and find a

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:35,150
workspace which is suitable for working

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,150
in that work shop

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:45,620
okay so Malik's generator and Malick's

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:49,220
has some Malick's add-ons so one of the

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:53,600
important add-on is Malik system lock so

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,540
basically in a library there are

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,160
computers in computer centers they are

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,650
very there are computers and people go

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,620
there students go there and make dirty

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:09,410
everything they'd make dirty on the

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,410
desktop they alternate the files the

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:16,040
changes it they install their own miss

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,110
installation is not a given there so

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,000
they make dirtiness over there they

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,170
create folders they create files and

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,150
then what the manager of that computer

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,560
Center do they he went to all the

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,690
computers over there and he cleans it so

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,540
Malik's system locked it's just with the

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:39,530
help of this you just need to go you

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:42,830
just need to enable that and ask thy

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,680
students to attend that lab lab and

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,500
after the students leave that you just

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,210
need to restart your computer and at the

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,160
point at the instant when you just

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:55,070
enable the system lock it will go

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,140
straight to that particular instance so

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,990
all those changes which are made after

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:05,390
enabling the system lock will be

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:10,160
vanished there is a package called as mu

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:13,070
so basically we are here and we are

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,990
working on different Linux distributions

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,860
someone works on Debian some works on

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:23,320
Fedora someone on different different

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:27,380
operating system so if you wanted

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:30,500
someone work on a yum wants to install

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:34,610
some packages using yum some works some

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:38,300
installed using sudo install app get

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,240
install so if in the case when you are

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,960
not familiar with Ubuntu you are just

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,839
familiar with fedora you want to install

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,630
some package for example yum install

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,940
package one

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,690
and if that particular package one

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,510
exists it will automatically translated

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,440
to apt-get install package 1 and you are

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:06,420
able to install that package so here a

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,210
few links the first one is where the the

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:13,170
web app is deployed you can find it here

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:15,510
the Malik's where the original is so is

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,970
there this is the link for Malik's

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:23,910
generator the web app where you will be

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:26,340
able to find the web app source code

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,920
this is the system lock source code this

00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,320
is the meu system code mu source code

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,540
and this is the Gita channel where

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:39,870
Malik's discussions goes on so on the

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:44,460
very first slide I went through this

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:47,660
conversation so this is the idea behind

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,580
that if we are able to customize an

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,380
operating system and use that in that

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,570
verse shop I think there would be no

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,910
problem if we turn off the screen saver

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,980
feature if we turn off the notification

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,750
feature and install all those

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,170
requirements which are needed for in

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,240
that particular workshop so no one needs

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,500
to be take care that a screen saver will

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,500
not get on in the middle

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,339
so these are the few peoples who were

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:27,459
starting with development in this

00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:31,300
project so you can find me here Thorin

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:33,149
this is harsh this is a my co developer

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,029
in the past - from the past two years

00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:39,850
Nico Yau and Andre these are the mentors

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:44,410
which helped me able to do all these

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:47,560
things without them it's not possible so

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,579
I would like to thank her on behalf of

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,820
mal extremes it's my honor to represent

00:14:50,579 --> 00:15:02,050
Malick's and Malick's generator on

00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:04,690
behalf of Melek steam thank you I hope

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:09,100
it makes some sense out of these 20

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:17,500
minutes so I welcome all the questions

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:23,860
from your side yes system Locker is

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:27,720
basically just a GS base code yeah there

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,610
is a little Python there so what we do

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,880
be in the in the windows if you use

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,019
Windows there is a system restore point

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,589
there is a way to create the system

00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,350
restore point so when you create that

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:46,810
point or it's similar like it's create

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:48,699
in Windows there is as Drive CDE so C

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,329
Drive will get restored that particular

00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:55,019
restore to that particular point so we

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:59,920
use exactly the same philosophy there in

00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:02,709
the system lock as as soon as we turn on

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,899
that particular system lock feature we

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:10,839
fix to that particular instance and all

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:14,019
the changes made after that enabling of

00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,250
the system log will will not to be the

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,529
permanent changes that will build

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,779
temporary changes and that will switch

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:22,320
again to that instance after restarting

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,320
the system

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,160
for the time being

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:47,210
users home directory yeah for the time

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:49,070
because yes yeah that will be maintained

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,890
only the changes made in the home

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,800
directory will be vanished yeah because

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,290
it is designed basically for workshops

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,160
like and laboratory like things so when

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:03,020
a person goes here I went I also went in

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,990
lab so I see that people's make

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,870
dirtiness on desktop and they make

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,449
changes the file they may also delete

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,250
the important files and they may also

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,280
create their own dirtiness on the

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,530
desktop so and the instructor of the lab

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,589
then goes to each and every computer and

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:25,160
then cleans it for the next next batch

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,689
to come again so he dough he that's a

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,880
solution he don't need to do that he

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,010
just need to restart the system and it

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:42,550
will get east again to that particular

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:42,550
instance okay

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:08,520
yeah yeah so why why just for whom

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,520
directly why not the whole workspace

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:16,020
yeah that would be much better now

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:18,610
the whole workspace which has all those

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,530
configurations all those packages all

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,000
those desirable settings which you

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,000
wanted to work for just suppose you

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,890
forget your laptop in your home and you

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,300
need to do some work you need to edit

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,510
some slides you need to edit some

00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:36,610
documents on a system this is not a

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:38,800
particularly ORS and using some other

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,370
systems make you feel that oh this is

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:47,500
not I'm not able to do that because it's

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:50,650
I'm not a happy able to do that so you

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:54,550
just have your pen drive your flash

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,130
drive you put it in and exactly you get

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:04,440
the same desktop screen that you have on

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:04,440
your laptop yeah

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,019
[Music]

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:51,240
yes yeah so so basically what I get you

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,670
locked here so people doesn't able to

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,870
use the pendrive

00:19:52,670 --> 00:20:02,550
yes they can not good live would that

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:07,280
also not possible yeah so the the

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,280
solution to that that I thought is here

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,860
we want to build docker containers for

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:20,429
web based interface so yeah so you just

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,410
get an address you have to go to that

00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,510
particular address with the honor

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,640
browser you are able to have you have

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:31,290
internet connection on your computer and

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,470
go to that particular link and there you

00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:37,710
will find the interface which is similar

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:41,160
to your working space computer it

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,380
depends it depends on the internet speed

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,559
it depends the packages you are

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,110
accessing so if the package is heavier

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,390
it would take time but for the

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:55,140
lightweight packages and just for the

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:58,760
convenience of us for the convenience of

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:02,580
us of in working that particular space

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,150
can be a solution to your issue did you

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,150
get my point

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
yes

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:51,700
yeah so you are changing the amount to

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:56,410
rather than whom okay okay yeah yeah and

00:21:51,700 --> 00:22:19,370
that needs to be changed from BIOS

00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:22,580
changing so we can set the priority over

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,510
there first look on the USB if there is

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,090
something to boot

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:34,490
then boot it from there otherwise go

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:35,420
straight to the harddrive so okay okay

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,690
okay

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,930
so these these changes can can be made

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,930
through

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,110
okay yeah this can be a solution just

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,110
for

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:14,549
okay so our working space will be from

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,530
the hard drive but the home directory if

00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:21,960
present in the pendrive will be copied

00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:24,179
straight to the yeah it's yeah is use

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:41,419
directly not copied yes it will be used

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:47,160
directly yeah this guess we can use that

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:52,169
idea too yeah thanks I can help others

00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:54,240
means to implement this also so for and

00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:58,760
for the web-based interface will it be a

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,760
solution for your case

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:16,700
okay and booting from pendrive where yes

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:30,360
okay and in the case where booting from

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,920
pendrive is possible means they haven't

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:43,160
logged the system so we can use in that

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:49,320
case our one person I distribution yeah

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:51,900
yeah yeah so in those particular case

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,900
where the works work systems are locked

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,160
you are not able to boot from pendrive

00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,250
you have to be with that particular

00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:07,130
feature okay I get something to learn

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,130
here also thank you any more questions

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:19,070
what is the home fit

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:31,299
with this OS hardware like generation 1

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:44,540
yeah it's 4.9 right now

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:50,770
yeah I have that image so sorry 4.4 it's

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:56,270
working on 4.4 but Sarah's asks about

00:25:50,770 --> 00:26:00,640
the hardware so it's basic so I tested

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:05,120
it on on a machine which has around 500

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:10,929
1212 EB of RAM and it works on Intel

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:15,950
Intel platinum coated you the oldest yes

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:17,809
500 megabyte of RAM Intel Platinum code

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:22,429
to do I booted live boot the system

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:28,490
doesn't install on it and the phys the

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:31,610
memo the hard drive is around yes yeah

00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:35,270
yeah so so it's it's completely

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:38,450
lightweight if you get through get

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:41,210
through the link here get through this

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,850
particular link of Malick's so this is

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,669
the root link you will find everything

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:50,990
here so you will able to find all those

00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:53,419
packages which are inside that and if

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,400
you find that ok this is this is the

00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:57,290
package that I don't need it there are a

00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,400
few packages we saw already installed in

00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:06,250
here you can just remove that and it's

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,250
very lightweight yes

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:22,090
yeah comfortably so our next task is

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,640
like all those operating systems today

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:29,800
have some personal assistant over there

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:35,380
so Felicia wants to implement their own

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:38,050
Susie based desktop so a desktop which

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:41,650
has Susie as their person as their

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:46,300
personal assistant and it can be used to

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:50,140
make user experience more and more

00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,830
personalized and so it gives suggestions

00:27:50,140 --> 00:28:02,400
based on the based on the work past a

00:27:53,830 --> 00:28:02,400
past experience so any more questions

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:13,780
