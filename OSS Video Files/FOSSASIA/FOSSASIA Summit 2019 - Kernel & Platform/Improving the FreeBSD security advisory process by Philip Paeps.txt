The FreeBSD Project is an old and well-established open source community. With volunteer developers around the world, handling security advisories in a timely manner while respecting third-party embargoes poses unique challenges. This presentation introduces the FreeBSD security officer team and the processes in place for handling security advisories affecting the FreeBSD open source operating system itself and the third-party components the project distributes.
