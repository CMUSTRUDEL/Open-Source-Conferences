From project development to translation and then packaging for distros like fedora seems tedious at times. Project development has its own release schedule which may or may not always fit availability of translators, timely execution of localization steps like push or pull strings, packaging and building, etc. As a result improper localized interfaces, delay, last moment breakage, poor user experience, etc. can be seen.

One solution to this is complete translation tracking at all there places: source repository, translation platform and release build system. Transtats does this, for every package! Plus, there are a few tools to track string loss during the process. Let's have a closer look on Transtats and discuss it's use cases.
