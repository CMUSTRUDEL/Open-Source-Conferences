Concepts in quantum computing have been around for over 30 years but only recently have practical quantum computers started to become available. While today's quantum computers are still very limited it's enough to start putting some of these concepts into practice. With the development of these machines there has been open source tooling developed to use them. One such example is QISKit, which is an Apache Licensed SDK for developing quantum applications. It lets you mix classical programming and quantum computing together to build applications that leverage the advantages of both. This workshop will explain the basics of quantum information theory and how you build quantum circuits. It will then provide a hands on introduction into using qiskit and how you can use it to implement quantum programs, how that can be integrated together within a larger application, and will also demonstrate how you can run your quantum program on real quantum computers.
