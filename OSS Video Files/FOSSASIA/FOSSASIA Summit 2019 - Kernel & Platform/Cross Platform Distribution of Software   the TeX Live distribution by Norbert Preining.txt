The TeX environment has grown slowly but steadily to a huge collection of programs, fonts, macro packages, support packages. Current TeX Live ships about 4Gb in more than 3500 different "TeX Live packages". As teTeX stopped to be developed and supported several years ago, TeX Live has taken over as the main TeX distribution in practical all areas, not only on Unix, but also Mac (MacTeX is based on TeX Live) and is also gaining on Windows (where MikTeX is still strong).

In this talk we recall shortly the history of TeX Live, its transition from CD/DVD based distribution to net based distribution, and the difficulties one faces when distributing a considerable piece of software to a variety of operating systems and hardware combinations. Topics touched are cross-platform distribution, security, release management etc.

Furthermore, we shortly will touch the topic of re-distributing TeX Live into Linux distributions like Debian, Red Hat, SuSE. Integrating TeX Live into any distribution is a non-trivial task due to big amount of post installation tasks that have to be performed. Although over the last years the quality of packages has improved, we (TeX Live development list) still get often bug reports that stem from incorrect packaging.
