It is impressive how much time and resources a team can save by using the OBS infrastructure to manages their packages creation and distribution. OBS is a generic system to build and distribute packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way.

Andrew Lee will cover the benefits of using OBS, explain some of it features and workflow for all your packaging and releasing needs, like automatically build package from scratch on multiple target distros and architectures, and show you how to setup OBS infrastructure to build your own Debian based distro easily.
