Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts, implemented in Computer code on a blockchain. They are immutable, tend to control asset flows and can be a major security risk.

Over the last 18 months, I have audited more than 20 complex smart contract systems. In this talk, I argue for smart contracts to be published as open source and their audits to be made public.

I highlight a number of high-profile security incidents, how they could have been prevented, and how open source significantly increases the security of smart contracts.

I also provide an insight into the auditing process and common mishaps.
