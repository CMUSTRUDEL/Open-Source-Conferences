	15 March 2019 14:55, Lecture Theatre

Flowchain aims to implement a blockchain that can provide a distributed ledger technology for the IoT and AI. And Flowchain already proposed the virtual blocks technology that can ensure chunked data (data streams) transactions in a near-instant manner. Furthermore, the virtual block technology can integrate with IPFS, an emerging distributed storage blockchain and can work as an off-chain mechanism to transfer your digital assets from one trusted party to another. In this presentation, Jollen will show the implementation of a distributed storage using Flowchain and IPFS open source technologies.

final speaker before our much-delayed

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,540
coffee break his jaw and chin the

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,790
founder and lead developer of flow chain

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,830
and open source based IOT block same

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:21,000
solution both areas in which he has

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:24,680
research interests also so Dolan how

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,680
many ways can we mess up a technology

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,489
from fraudulent project today I'm going

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:43,550
to introduce the approaching project in

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:49,500
a bit and show how it's how II in

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:54,329
integrate with the IP FX as we know the

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:59,460
project is an emerging technologies may

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:02,910
be is changing our life and what's

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,150
approaching it's also in Russian

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,909
technology especially in night for the

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,670
Internet of Things and the most

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,200
important future of Brad approaching

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:21,240
it's a capability of real-time

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:25,860
transactions so the Bitcoin it's a the

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:31,770
central centralized protein system but

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:36,180
now we distributed so on our disability

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:40,280
a technology the IP effects which is

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:45,380
passport also changed our life as fully

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:50,549
disability so the approachin is a

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:55,909
technology that not only the centralized

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,329
but also fully each eluted protein can

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,329
integrate with

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:06,420
ipfx but it turns meaningless the

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:09,509
protein is beyond ipfx h9 protein is not

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,930
built and ipfs

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,420
it's denied from the garage I mean it's

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,630
in

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:21,310
from the label especially he has this

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:25,270
own algorithms architectures other

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:28,860
algorithms and architectures has already

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:37,720
published in several explaining papers

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:41,580
last year so what benefits approach and

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,830
print ipfx one it's the real-time

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,290
translations community and the other

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,400
it's the library branch and architecture

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:56,370
so I will show a very quick demo shortly

00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:00,250
to explain class has high hydrogen

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:06,970
activation power so frozen to remove the

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:09,640
PKI and use the PP PP ki the PPA is also

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,780
called pseudonymous or supplication it's

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:20,079
a 10 and our education technique starts

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:24,160
in 1990 I think so the PK p p ki

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:27,040
comprises of two random numbers one is

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,540
linda in nara it's a puzzle a puzzle

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,690
it's a question so the IOT devices have

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,260
to answer the paddles and use the

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:44,410
answers in the translations as well as

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:47,730
nature's so that's a whole picture of

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:52,150
reproduction technology the IOT devices

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:57,910
are so self organized as a peer-to-peer

00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:01,510
network in the pileup Roger and the PPK

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:06,760
I in a puppy browser and generates a

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:08,920
pair of PB ki for IOT devices and IOT

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:15,880
devices can use the rental value as a

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:19,090
public key so the public key can help

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,810
the public option to also Oh such the

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:26,320
IOT devices and an error when the number

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,410
is a puzzle the problem is very

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,440
Longstreet I mean is a large size of

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:37,390
shield robbery

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:40,510
Fangio bites even longer the puzzle is

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:45,030
protesting to private went through IOT

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:48,690
devices and IOT devices had to answer

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:52,570
questions of a parcel after a subpoena

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:56,560
subpoena questions over a puzzle you can

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,340
use its answers in the Russian data

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,380
structure

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,580
I assured a data structure auditory

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,970
image rise later

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:10,300
so in short it's a most important thing

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,840
for IOT devices because as previously

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,980
mentioned the IOT devices less less

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,810
computation power and less memory size

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:26,230
so we have to use another technique for

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:31,540
devices authentication so in short I

00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:34,510
want to cut the fraudulent network as a

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:39,340
IOT trust machine as we know there are

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:42,640
many newspapers mentioned the internet

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,240
approach and the Internet of trust the

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:52,590
idea is good because we have to improve

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:56,050
the internet for better light so that

00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:01,510
trust machine of fraud chain comprises

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:06,190
of three important features one it's the

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:09,430
translations of the data and the second

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,580
one is nice in nature which is generated

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:17,430
from the parcel and search that's why

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:20,610
it's public key the public key are

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:24,160
generated by the published version

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:28,690
actually it's generated by the miners

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:34,060
the public option so if you are running

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:37,650
a frozen known and join proteins popery

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,919
Russian Network you can receive

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,919
bracketed words

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:51,850
like a Bitcoin so the algorithm is

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:56,230
simple but I think I don't have too much

00:06:51,850 --> 00:07:00,160
time to explain the algorithm to details

00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:04,360
today so if you need some technical

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:08,020
details I mean the number ones so it's

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:13,030
very secure because the public kids are

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:19,110
very hard to predict and very hard

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:22,270
through heck so that's where our

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:26,710
fundamentals of broad shanks real-time

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:31,170
translations technologies from real time

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:34,840
it's very important for us it's because

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,470
according to our approach in the future

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,790
we may have about such a person of

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:52,210
record data which would be real-time

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:56,190
data so the PDK is a fundamental of

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:59,140
protein to achieve real time data

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,990
translations the narrow important

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,710
technologies of protein it's virtual

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:09,850
brock the idea is very simple

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:14,410
every IOT device has its own local

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:19,510
brushin you can find the term virtual

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:23,620
trend in some research papers so idea

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:28,270
it's quite quite first and every device

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:32,860
head support the folk means that every

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:38,520
iot devices has its own branch from the

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:44,260
Genesis block and this stay up in April

00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:48,090
the Russian network to remove the needs

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:51,220
of handling half walk

00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:56,260
like the traditional processes terms

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:58,990
such as Bitcoin and Syrian so what's the

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,680
relation between the virtual fraction

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:06,190
and the authentication solutions so

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:11,010
let's go back to the ipfx interplanetary

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:14,380
file system ipfx cuts a file into

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,590
several pieces of data each piece is

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,550
called chance so for example I have a

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,170
file and

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:27,220
ipfs cut it into four data chunks and

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:32,320
each trunk is a translation to proteins

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:39,540
private network so let's pay attention

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:44,260
to let your right right hand corner so

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:49,770
there are four pieces of stream data the

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:53,400
third one is labeled as the E string and

00:09:49,770 --> 00:10:00,400
by using pro-trans peer-to-peer algorism

00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:03,930
the data III so that's the note of Labor

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,490
or the five of its successor node

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:13,510
restoration of processes or not it's

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:16,930
rendered and the restoration it's very

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:20,670
secure because the solution space and

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:25,000
hash key and hash key is very hard to

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:30,870
predict as very hard to attack protein

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:37,000
technologies so I'm going to finger our

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:42,520
cert and for the fraud of the fraud in

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:47,890
this whole picture so we can pay

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:50,230
attention to just the red red words so

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,830
that stuff from the virtual branch

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,830
mining

00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,839
each IOT know that's a virtual brat

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,630
minor to generate virtual brats locally

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:10,500
are a rock quarry means the low Shiprock

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:15,029
brats stored in the fresh or I mean in

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,300
the local storage of IOT devices you

00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:22,560
don't need to send a virtual product or

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:27,209
internet so it stay up I mean this

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:30,560
agitator reduce lots of penguins and can

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:33,620
be used in several

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,120
how a constrained devices such as

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,880
Arduino

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:43,260
actually we have a you know an IOT

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:49,709
devices tend more on the first fraud in

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:54,000
our booth so and there is also a protein

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:57,209
node called happy note it's ok with

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,569
between the private option and public

00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:03,300
projects after preparing the virtual

00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:06,930
brats the IOT know can stop me the

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,940
virtual drugs to have we not for cam

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:15,300
sensors and after the virtual products

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:19,050
were verified successfully all

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:23,790
transitions of Bhoja brands will be sent

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:30,290
through ipfs node for storage

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:35,819
transitions and data so i'm going to

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:39,060
simply introduce the whole process in

00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:43,350
this simple diagram so if you are

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:47,610
running approach and had we not then you

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:52,290
are mining frozen products and you you

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:56,250
will receive Brock rewards as well so

00:12:52,290 --> 00:13:00,029
the process quite simple the first day

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,160
is to verify bunch of brats to see if

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:06,210
rebel ship rocks are varied

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:11,050
Oh bird named had we know

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:14,580
well be responsible for building ehe

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:19,780
former coach in the virtual browse then

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:25,060
the virtual brats goes to a new Brock

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:30,490
and broadcast to a Russian network after

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:35,430
new Brock has been verified by protein

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:44,400
Network you will be received Russian

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:48,790
private words so I just give everyone

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:53,290
Christ simple idea about fraudulent

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:58,510
projects and the whole project supports

00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:02,500
the IOT currently we are working with

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:06,670
our vendors in China to bring our IOT

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,400
brush I heard to remark as in us we

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,070
don't have a investigate schedule of BA

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,270
actually I think we were all shipping

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,830
the products in October this year piracy

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,830
by the end of this year

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:30,430
so I'm giving a demo

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,670
everything mentioned that there it's

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:45,740
unlucky Harvin of course everything is

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:50,030
open source and how to create start

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:53,120
using protein oppressed cultural

00:14:50,030 --> 00:15:00,320
approaches github and and oral response

00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:03,880
periods of erosion hybrid it's a still

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:09,710
under test net I mean the private beta

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:13,300
we will be wrong cinnamon and nest monks

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,300
April uprising

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:34,029
so I I already had have brought your

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,149
high dreamily top so you can just Stalin

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:39,610
main application the file names are

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:45,250
indexed archers yes the frozen in

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:49,410
fermentation X or 100% in JavaScript and

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,410
from the screen console

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:58,440
this message shows that she is

00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:05,490
connecting to resonance approachin and

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:09,880
start to mining the Cobras and here I

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:15,690
have a West African I'm sending

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,690
streaming data to the height we know

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:27,460
so there it's no virtual products or now

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:32,290
the data cannot be verified but we have

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:35,800
to wait an ro1 meaning to see the

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:46,060
results but it's ok we can wait for

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:49,450
another 1 minute so I have a recap video

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:53,740
that's about 2 minutes I will show a

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,920
video later so if you are interested in

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,440
broadcast technologies a priest video

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,190
our website project our CEO and check

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,370
out the source codes in our github and

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:11,470
for more news press power follow my

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:14,790
Twitter my name is Joran so I think it's

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,790
very easy to search

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:32,300
okay yeah two minutes video totally kept

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,770
my presentation

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,110
flow chain is a distributed ledger

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,080
technology for peer-to-peer it could

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,880
cost 3.3 billion US dollars when

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,670
compared to centralized cloud computing

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,790
now flow chains computing pool is here

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,500
to resolve the issue of high costs

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:52,140
private blockchain represents IOT

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,510
blockchain with flow chains exclusive

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,600
flow chain tokenize chip and software

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,760
development kit sdk the iot companies

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,190
can build their own IOT block chains on

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,690
float chains and private blockchain the

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,430
advantage is that companies can

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,220
customize their products and service

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,960
based on flow chains the entire system

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,960
can be seen as an ecosystem called

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,470
hybrid blockchain it uses pseudonymous

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,840
public key infrastructure PP ki to audit

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,940
the IOT device identification to ensure

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,820
the data security and the auditing speed

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,470
with PP ki the modes on public

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,220
blockchain can efficiently and rapidly

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,220
