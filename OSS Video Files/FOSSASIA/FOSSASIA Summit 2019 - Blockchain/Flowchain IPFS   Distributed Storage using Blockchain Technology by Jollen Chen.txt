Flowchain aims to implement a blockchain that can provide a distributed ledger technology for the IoT and AI. And Flowchain already proposed the virtual blocks technology that can ensure chunked data (data streams) transactions in a near-instant manner. Furthermore, the virtual block technology can integrate with IPFS, an emerging distributed storage blockchain and can work as an off-chain mechanism to transfer your digital assets from one trusted party to another. In this presentation, Jollen will show the implementation of a distributed storage using Flowchain and IPFS open source technologies.
