Description: 
	15 March 2019 14:30, Lecture Theatre

Blockchain can do for business what the internet did for communication. Powering that transformation is Hyperledger, hosted by The Linux Foundation. Innovators in finance, banking, healthcare, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing and technology are creating open, standardized and enterprise-grade distributed ledger blockchain frameworks and code bases to produce tangible business results. In this session, we will discuss IBM's Blockchain strategy, from its ongoing contributions to the Linux Foundation Hyperledger project to how it is helping clients build, grow and accelerate Blockchain networks.

okay why is the right Wow from IBM is a

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,330
cloud solution specialist specializing

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,130
in particular in blockchains and hyper

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,210
ledger yes all right

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,839
well take your way right good afternoon

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,570
everyone

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,189
so my name is hi Wayne all right so

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,230
today we are going to spend some time on

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,760
the blockchains part of it right how

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,240
many of you how many of you heard about

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,810
blockchain the fundamental stuff oh okay

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,760
Wow

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,070
alright so I'm not going to go through

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,469
that the basics right but I want to

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,079
share be in terms of I'll say I've been

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,210
experienced in starting this journey

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,160
right so copy I start with telling Asha

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,290
stories right well howdy this journey

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,710
has started I can start that with

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,090
something called Bitcoin as well for tv3

00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,399
so we started Esther with some size to

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,410
be such project right so IBM's with the

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,070
color blue so we call it blue coin right

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,000
so we dissociate we understand what the

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,100
technology does Oh

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,500
bitcoin is not the technology right the

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,660
technology is called rock scene and it

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,110
seems like this technology can deliver

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,510
the kinds of capabilities all function

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,540
T's that is needed by advise customers

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,460
right so it becomes a research project

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,470
if you come up for a development this is

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,500
where we start to develop I become a

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,450
full skills solutions right and this is

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,670
where we start to get into outside a

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,799
full force of building this as a

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,640
business from IBM perspective right

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,159
however right what I wanted to go into

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,229
more details will be the wavy edges

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,329
started into the open source Janissa of

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,670
course as we know machines we talk about

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,170
Ledger's me to about immutability s we

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,390
talk about finally disappearing right

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,030
there are key elements we always

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,159
mentioned between the blockchain right

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,640
we talked about yes they disputed

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,770
Ledger's be centralized everyone keep a

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,780
copy of the same transaction right

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,229
within the network so which mean we are

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,210
talking about building a network right

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,070
what does it mean from you what does

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,649
mean from our customers or our user

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,170
perspective it can be a neighbor of one

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,160
person so it needs to be a collective of

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,020
people within that community

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,720
right then this is where we start would

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,430
have to contribute the code into the

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,900
open source community itself but of

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,270
course this is where we talk about what

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,770
to be stored inside the blockchain this

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,290
way we start talking about the

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,720
transactions how we should execute the

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,910
logic right consistently as as my

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,920
contract for all the participants this

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,320
is where the code start to develop

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,060
become more and more mature and we

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,670
started with a project called open

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,580
blockchain initiative and eventually we

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,710
donate the code into these communities

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,950
all right how many of you heard about

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:51,160
hyper ledger oh okay

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,960
most of you alright so the journey

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,970
started back in almost I would say the

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,280
end of 2016

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,020
where by hypothesis projects is formally

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,630
so-called being established under

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,540
leaders foundation right and of course

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,910
this is where our IBM's an apostle panel

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,830
of the committee itself contribute the

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,080
source code try contribute our knowledge

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,300
in terms of setting the directions how

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,940
the blockchain can be beneficial to the

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,340
industries and this is where the growing

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,530
of the community start to happen right

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,250
and today's as far as I know we have

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,930
more than 250 members right from various

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,300
technology provider I believe like a

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,580
service in in the committee as well but

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,250
we also have our a lot of so-called

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,590
industry players right in supply change

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,930
in health case even in government

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,770
agencies who participate and contribute

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,630
their knowledge into the project itself

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,090
just like any others I would say open

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,410
source community right Hubbard edges of

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,950
course in this case it's not belong to

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,500
IBM

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,290
right very important right and there are

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,530
multiple projects multiple projects

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,930
under the umbrella of Apple edges the

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,580
one I would say actively being

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,890
contribute in terms of source course

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:08,440
knowledge experience will be something

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,730
called habala Derek happily forever how

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,030
many oh you heard about have a lady

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,820
frapping oh okay much lesser compared

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,919
then aspect this Hubble adjuster epic is

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,380
one of the outset of projects right we

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,750
call it block chain operating system to

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,190
be set up to build the network right

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,639
interconnected network right we're

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,580
concept of order

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,340
with concert appears right separating to

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,350
endow cynthia's committing peers as well

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,070
with the consensus mechanism built into

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,410
the order we have car technology so we

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,110
have been gradually starting the journey

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,210
right when does when so-called a

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,500
community is fall back into December

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:51,680
2016 by introducing question 0.5 version

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,389
0.6 then we started a regulars so-called

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,550
release my working closely with

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:59,510
community so right now we are in the

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,880
stable version of 1.4 right and should

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,860
be end of this man on end of a Linux

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,010
quarter then we should be releasing

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,810
apology for a big 2.0 and of course

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,540
there are a lot of new exciting features

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,110
has been built along the way from parody

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,000
recollections multiple channels zero

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,610
knowledge proof so those are some of the

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,310
key features our customers needed right

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,039
and Industry need us as well in order to

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,320
build a comprehensive solution based on

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,260
population trapping or based on option

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,669
as a technology so of course the key

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,100
question always ask right these

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,470
technologies seems to only happening for

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,350
the past two years right is that we

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,419
Bitcoin in 2008 but something relevant

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,970
to industries right only happen in the

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,500
past two years is it real right I know

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,900
she how many of you whether to you ask

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,539
yourself is this viewing rightly these

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,610
articles you see on the newspapers this

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:56,560
solution is real does it release help to

00:05:52,610 --> 00:06:00,680
solve industry problems and this is way

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,110
with a past Englishman now I'll say IBM

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,840
helping our customers right in terms of

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,720
building will and solid boxing driven

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,840
solution in various industries right

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,200
with the technology of our ability of

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,210
rapid ISA it allowed us to be defense my

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,880
contracts right to a scheme model

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,979
different business processes and based

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,470
on the same technology which is called

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,300
happily differently and this is just as

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,539
some of the customers that we have right

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,389
across various industry some the logo

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:34,640
you may city you may get familiar with

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:37,760
it some of the logo you may not even

00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,940
heard about it right there are few areas

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,580
that I will say

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,310
thing I will say that that is actually

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,880
the key focus of what items heading into

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,490
as well

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,890
so Don the evil example in Tiffany's

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,130
right so we're by collective of banks

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,290
set up in the network between banks in

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,630
order to allow a financing facility to

00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,810
be provided to the importer to the

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,790
exporter in a much more easy and

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,100
streamlined way all right we also work

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,050
with customers with such as former such

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,720
as Nestle right in order to build and

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,060
ensure that facility right along there

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,980
for supply chain we also work with a

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,660
customer in this region right customers

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,540
in highlights right in order to build a

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,360
letter current is so-called processes of

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,820
so those are some of the I'll say the

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,030
example whereby how have a ledger

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,940
therapy right okay to be implemented and

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:33,510
run as a production solution on the

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,970
market itself of course this logo looks

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,100
nice right it seems like those eyes

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,660
thing IBM customers as well but that is

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,840
not a main point for today session right

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,580
the main point is how we derive these

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,210
problems thickness this business use

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,550
case

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,550
hi Balaji phobic can be the technology

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,360
to address those challenges all

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,070
throughout the engagement with the

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,290
customers right we learn it ourselves we

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,380
learn it from our customers we start

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:01,230
identify a few key major characteristics

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,360
right which is needed by our customers

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,740
and this is important in order to grow

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,450
our hydrophobics projects successfully

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,080
right so as you put it into the six

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,900
category six category right is there

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,880
never exist in these problem statements

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,040
in this particular challenges right is

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,350
it only you is the only a set of people

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,390
or you need to work with upstream

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,000
downstream with different set of

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,100
participant within the industry in order

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,770
to deliver something in order to execute

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,770
certain processes right so this is

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,589
whether this system work on each picture

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:42,510
second where are those information are

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:44,730
stopped right in a CRM solution is it in

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,890
a piece is it even one part of the photo

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,480
and some of it you may be surprised they

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,000
are still written in paper right

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,130
especially in supply chain so how all

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,410
this information

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:58,130
we share in order to streamline the

00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,580
business process and who will consume

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,190
those information multiple writers right

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,260
who will contribute the data who is

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,690
going to use the data for certain

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,200
activities right multiple writers should

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,870
be involved in that process itself and

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,970
instead a trust do I believe the

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,760
information you share to me can I use it

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,770
immediately for the execution is there a

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,930
level of trust between you and me for me

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:27,740
to proceed with the business transaction

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,980
and process is it a process to balance

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,440
it

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,270
oh it's just ad hoc activity we are

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,880
killing me and lastly right roof right

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,580
what other execution rules what are the

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,890
logic we need to access so call depends

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,830
on it in order to sqp the big this magic

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,250
process example do I tell you after you

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,560
do your shift or delivery to me right -

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,390
I pay based on this interest rate has

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,550
been agreed upon so those are the

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,270
business different our say different our

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,710
business process involve in the NASA

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,050
right whether you are in financial

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,880
whether you are in supply chain whether

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,240
you are in gamma agency or even

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,190
healthcare industry those things apply

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,770
so this sounds like whoa a lot of

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,280
criteria right in order to so call

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,170
Mickey solution real for the actually

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,410
successor so let's go through a simple

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,480
case right so whereby review a solution

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,000
surrounding it's called fit lens

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,640
I know sure how many heard about it but

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,470
I believe you always seen a lot of big

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,840
container ship shipping around the world

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,960
right and majority of the goods we are

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,150
having today including your shirts your

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,840
jeans the food you're eating right is a

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,990
ship in container right so how how much

00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,660
time it takes right in order to ship the

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,030
container from the exporter to importer

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,800
so this is where our collaboration with

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,090
must right with our customers right

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,760
start to where she had like something

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:59,480
very important the cost of processing

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,660
the documents itself is higher than the

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,879
shipping cost right so especially with

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,459
now nowadays the fuel prices going

00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,989
there are a lot of more and more

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:10,489
manpower is needed automation engine

00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:13,249
isn't that in order to process the

00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:14,329
paperwork it become not scalable in

00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:17,059
terms of business process perspective

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:19,220
all right so we're by rock chain can be

00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,379
a tendency to to bring different people

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,649
in the logistics supply chain ecosystem

00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,509
together and have a common roof set

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,429
right to allow the process to be

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:30,350
streamlined to move forward and don't

00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,789
forget each parties have their systems

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,759
in order to keep track in terms of

00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:37,429
logistics supply change warehouse so

00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,399
blockchain able to help to educate those

00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:42,169
information of course blockchain sounds

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,149
as a interesting technology right

00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:46,549
everyone's want to explore the potential

00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,589
debate to maximize it but of course if

00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:50,839
you have a certain principle and decline

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,089
to move forward as well right so this is

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,279
where the entry point becomes something

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,429
important with the solution we are

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,979
building while we try to address pieces

00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:04,189
differentiation or is for the larger

00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:06,889
benefit of communities or this is more

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:09,049
to us to create a new market right and

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,809
each of the use case will be tailored

00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:15,439
and slightly being position and build it

00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:19,100
according to the entry point into the to

00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:20,329
address the business challenge and this

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,399
will be basically out some sort of

00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,139
guiding principle right so that we can

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,699
build the solution that address the

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:30,289
needs by the user

00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:32,419
my industries and this is just our set a

00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,399
starting point right you may realize

00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,069
that oh you have IBM's right you have so

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,269
many projects right so I heard about

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,489
someone building this network I heard

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,619
about another pearl soko vendor building

00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:44,779
the networks as well it seems like a

00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:46,519
pocket of network here a pocket of never

00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,739
over here and somebody building

00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,499
something information in certain ways

00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:52,429
still in silo but in bigger silo right

00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:55,419
ruddiness

00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:59,079
if the connect connect so the next

00:12:55,419 --> 00:13:02,089
evolutions of or the next phase of

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:06,470
blockchain what we're looking at is

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:09,499
building networks of networks networks

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,899
of networks right we we start to realize

00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:14,209
that it should never serve a particular

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,949
purpose right they need to streamline

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,410
supply chain process they need to

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:21,050
streamline governing process itself

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,000
to streamline kyc process for banks but

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,129
a certain point within the processes are

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,259
they may need to internet or interact

00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:29,779
with another network this is where the

00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:32,360
concept of network of networks can

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,009
picture a certain point of execution can

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,639
we bring this set of information in

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:40,339
image to buoy right move to the next so

00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,779
Kourt never saw so you may start to see

00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:43,579
some the news happening on the ground

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,399
whereby we talk about in the ledger

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:48,410
protocol right collaboration between ET

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,420
r IAM and Hippolytus projects right in

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,519
order to allow this kind of information

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,639
sharing between two different network to

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,589
be happen that is new in our say infancy

00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,740
in terms of the project status itself

00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,839
but the industry and the vendors are

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,050
moving to the same direction right in

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,730
order to solve the problem right

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,560
of course from IBM perspective right

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,329
open source is something I've been has

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,740
been doing right for past I was a twenty

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,199
five years starting from Linux

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,300
conditions to Java to eclipse right and

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,370
even today for happily Furby

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,199
that work is not going to stop right at

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,519
any point I'm are we have had more than

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,120
hundreds and thousands of developers

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,949
contributing codes into boxing community

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,100
as well right and fabric is just one of

00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:34,579
the projects iBM is contributing and of

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,589
course we want to make this easy for our

00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:38,810
user right especially for those people

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,610
who are sitting in this room or I want

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,610
to test it up I want to start something

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,709
right can I test it out with happy lady

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,230
for a bit I can are leveraging on the

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,660
new features within fabric 1.4 in order

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,519
to execute certain activity yes please

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,120
feel free to a PC to club Donna

00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,199
beyond.com

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,689
so we can offers you some beta so call

00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:04,069
Sbisa for you to Tessa but eventually

00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:06,889
the messaging right is to allow happily

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,990
jerax to offer as a service to our

00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:11,569
customers right to you guys to continue

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,149
to a CPU interesting solution on top of

00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:15,829
it right so that is obviously at least a

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,529
commitment for my p.m. to allow the

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:20,750
technology adoption to be easier right

00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,819
for everyone on the in the industry to

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,649
move over

00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:28,759
so of course so far what you see is

00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:31,410
still to select right how blockchain

00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,269
application may eventually looks like

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,539
right so I want to give you a simple

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:38,759
example of how the solution actually

00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:42,829
looks like oops

00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,829
amici me right

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,160
right so this is one of the examples of

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,760
the solutions that we have this call IBM

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,340
to trust right I'm sure hire many of you

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,970
never heard about it imagine today you

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,850
have a packaging of mango in front of

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,550
you how many of you rather wonder where

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,770
it is item coming from he from

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,890
Philippines is it from the United States

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,770
is it from Europe or Vietnam and in

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,480
between who has actually process it who

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,280
has as it cleaned up right today

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,780
actually implementing sustainable

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,300
plantations right

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,950
are there has been certified right with

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,320
the factory to process it with the

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,880
cleanest certifications so those are

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,760
what we call full supply chain right

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,850
whereby in u.s. itself last year alone

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,070
they are people forcing or actually

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:48,440
passed away because of e.coli bacteria

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:51,260
wishes exist in the veggie itself so

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,660
those are the four supply chain reality

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,730
right people had confidence with Eric

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,770
you stop believing what they are getting

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,350
from the story is actually so-called

00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,450
safe to be consumed but in reality is

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,600
after item are actually separated in

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,870
every piece in the world and it may

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,180
change hands in between with multiple

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,520
suppliers with multiple disputed with

00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,730
multiple logisitics provider to ship it

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,579
from the farm all the way to the video

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,550
shop right so this solution work at NTC

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,820
help us to keep track in terms of the

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,670
activities as well as who is involved in

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,010
that supply change for the disability

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:35,030
and this is where I have a product

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:38,030
basically luckily carrot to be track

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,610
right and I was he punching okay this

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,500
particular palette or this particular

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,520
box during the shipment they I want to

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,780
track the origin from so this is where I

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,680
 the lot number just for it

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:58,190
alright I want to use it for the

00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:00,440
selections then I run the trace so this

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,140
solution has been connected to various

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,390
for supply chain provider I all the way

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,890
to the farmers right to the food

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,930
processors

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,780
people like Walmart as a retailer to

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,910
logistics parties so that each of them

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,520
still continue to use their system to do

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,680
data entry to do management but piece of

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,680
information based on gs1 standard will

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,750
be actually sent to the auction and each

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,630
of them where she keeps her like a copy

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,910
of ledger for the transaction itself and

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,460
this is where wallah we started she

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,170
built the full topology for the food

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,270
supply chain for the first time so I

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,520
know exactly this box of the veggies

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,710
shipped to the British Ibiza

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,559
he said she Oh getting from which

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,520
particular disputa right it has been

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,490
processed by this particular

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,230
manufacturer it has been so cocky in

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,820
which particular warehouse and all the

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,980
way to the farmer right and always

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,320
remember the item you're getting may not

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,970
sauce just from one had your fun right

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,700
because the producer always sauce for

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,940
multiple fun collective process it

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,240
before we dispute again to the different

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:11,390
video shop so this is the VCB did

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,830
everyone right for to ensure the food

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,380
quality we are getting to ensure the

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,640
food safety marketing you do want to get

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,790
into situations whereby

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,040
oh the item required to be recalled due

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,470
to bacterial infection due to expiry

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,390
date and you may not know this

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,910
particular item skills being set leading

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,190
around the market itself so that is

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,830
quite dangerous right foot put it this

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,780
way and today with a effort based on

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,090
what we have studies now with format we

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,440
are the supplier they saw is easily took

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,970
more than one way to discover any item

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,840
or to trace back all the way to the

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,210
suppliers

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,790
right which is where it all I mean right

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,710
just imagine if you have someone you're

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,809
close with emitter to the hospital and

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,000
they don't know where it's a soft of the

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,160
infection happen right so that is

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,900
something that IBM working with the

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,960
players in the industry we try to

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,190
actually build a solution to address

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,870
right of course this wouldn't be

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,360
happening without the contribution of

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,309
open source right without the so-called

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,440
industry player committing to the open

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,480
source technology as well right so we

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,340
realized this is something beneficial to

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
everyone and this is where the

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,440
directions of IBM to continued support

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,420
open-source technology all right I think

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:44,700
we have three minutes I am open for

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:47,160
questions if Jays just curiously

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,470
I think it's really fun and interesting

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,950
to use the blockchain technology to

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,540
trace the source and all of the

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,270
different pit stops and checks that's

00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:01,260
happened through your food supply chain

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:04,590
yeah but we're placing a huge amount of

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,650
trust on people who are handling these

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:11,700
goods from one place to another and I

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:14,880
wonder how is it any different from just

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:19,980
having a manifest and a list and maybe a

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,330
table in a database yeah right so thanks

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,860
thanks for the question right so it's

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,600
important right this is something that

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,580
we realized I can we come up with a

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,710
solution whereby all the information can

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,110
be just using a suspect sheet or even

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,000
you as comprehensive database to do but

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,060
where we'd realized that is there has

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,700
been done and it's not practical right

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,910
because for those suppliers right a lot

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,500
of outside parties with India so for the

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,810
nursery change a value chain is

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,000
ethically they are not they are ready

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,460
reluctant to pass that information to

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,350
other people to manage right so that

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,120
becomes like the key concern right each

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,130
one of them have their own security

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,890
policies and the way they want to manage

00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:01,020
the data right because if they pass that

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,180
responsibiiity to you then the question

00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,960
to you is is it you taking the risk of

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:08,760
managing my data all right so so this is

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,980
where the trust issue coming to come to

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,530
problem so trust on the item itself and

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,790
also the trust you can help me to

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,320
protect my data right we saw two

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,880
reaction one is I would like them to

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,250
pass it to you I

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,410
NVC provider reluctant to take that

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,540
responsibility all right don't say sorry

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,670
I'm just a technology provider your

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,380
information is your information right

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,750
then this way become a chicken eggs

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,340
scenario so block chaining that is

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,260
nicely fit to address that pamphlet said

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,570
well I Stacy you have a control of what

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,790
to be to share it lets the the

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:46,830
participants have a greater amount of

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:49,170
trust in each other but it doesn't do I

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,350
know that they actually did this well we

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,240
don't know yeah yeah Oliver has been due

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,830
to an improv change this is a general

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,760
supply chain issue the good news is I

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,230
can take another question

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,020
in the meantime does anybody in the room

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,260
have a mini DP to HDMI adapter I thought

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:07,920
I had one but it badly don't mini DP or

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,360
Thunderbolt two HDMI and whoa anyone's

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,100
asking answering that question that any

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:24,780
more questions

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:27,990
fabulous I wanted to ask about how the

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,600
blockchain development is going on in

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:34,920
the future and I think last year was

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,990
like the height of the blockchain craze

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:41,790
and now the hype is starting to die down

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:45,330
with the values of the Bitcoin and so on

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:49,260
not growing anymore so how do you see

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:51,960
the future there I see the futures

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,940
whereby there's a certain train went by

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,190
it so call a cool down a bit right in

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,380
industries but I also start to realize

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,690
that the industry taking more serious in

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,850
by looking at what it tend to soften

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,950
right you are right as in last year

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,260
yourself we see a lot of so-called PLC

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,700
kind of proof technologies right whether

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,700
it works in supply chain whether

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,420
important in healthcare but we always

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,880
ask the user of aspect accustomed us

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,500
what actually you tend to solve right

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,470
does the technology help you to prove

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,390
case those so called chalice itself

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,880
right whereby technology is convincing

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,790
to axis of it now this year we start to

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,320
see maturity going up whereby we first

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,240
have to realize that this is not just a

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,640
piece of thing a technology I can

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,590
implement myself we need a level we need

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,530
to solve real problem statement right

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,120
this is where we do see calling now but

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,760
at the same time beast to see

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,070
user Serena's into getting something

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,560
into production great thought to pick up

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,160
at the same time so far for me so it's a

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,470
good thing right

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,630
I believe this happened not only to have

00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:00,420
blockchain he happened to any other

00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:01,890
technologies as well okay we are we have

00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,950
one thank you very much

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,510
that was my meandering same sort of

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,340
Bakhtin becoming reasonable rather than

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,960
crazy hyped so a round of applause

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,420
please

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,420
