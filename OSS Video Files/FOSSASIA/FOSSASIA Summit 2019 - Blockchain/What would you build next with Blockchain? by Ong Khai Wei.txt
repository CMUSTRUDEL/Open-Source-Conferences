Blockchain can do for business what the internet did for communication. Powering that transformation is Hyperledger, hosted by The Linux Foundation. Innovators in finance, banking, healthcare, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing and technology are creating open, standardized and enterprise-grade distributed ledger blockchain frameworks and code bases to produce tangible business results. In this session, we will discuss IBM's Blockchain strategy, from its ongoing contributions to the Linux Foundation Hyperledger project to how it is helping clients build, grow and accelerate Blockchain networks.
