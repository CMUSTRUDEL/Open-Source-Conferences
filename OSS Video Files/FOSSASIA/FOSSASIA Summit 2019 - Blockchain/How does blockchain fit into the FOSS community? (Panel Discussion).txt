How does Blockchain fit into the FOSS community?

unlike many other projects that are started in the FOSS community, or where the ideals of the project are very much aligned with the FOSS community, many Blockchain projects appear to be following a different philosophy, and the fact that the Blockchain code is under a Free Software and Open Source licence is more incidental than intentional.

A selection of speakers coming to FOSSASIA will join the panel

hello everyone so this is a panel about

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,139
blockchain and the free software

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,929
community how does the blockchain fit

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,699
into the free software community I have

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,650
been hosting this panel at a few other

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,619
conferences with some interesting

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,939
results and discussions and I hope we're

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,949
going to have an interesting discussion

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:31,369
here the basic idea is the question at

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,530
least last year when I started this

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:38,309
blockchain was very very much hyped and

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,590
very much dominated by coins and tokens

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,260
and people trying to make money and it

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,200
seemed really at odds with what the free

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,700
software community is standing for and

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,500
so I was starting and asked a question

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,850
what's what's going on here this is

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,820
coming out of the free software

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,340
community in some form it's using open

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,890
source free software code for the most

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,020
part and everybody is saying it should

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,530
be using free software and open source

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,619
code for different reasons that we'll

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,900
talk about and so I started to organize

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,869
meetups and these discussions in order

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,689
to find out more about what's going on

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,420
and what's the what's the reason for the

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:22,619
state that the things were in so quickly

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,070
introduce the panelists so you have

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:31,350
already heard talk so we have a Stephon

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:37,250
buyer from sorry what was your company

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:46,470
name again from Krypton mix we have mod

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:48,659
sorry Ahmad from get coin we have sub

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:57,110
tak sorry sorry subtract from get coin

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:57,110
and a mod from Mozilla and Jolin okay

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:09,270
I'm gonna start off the questions I'm

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,270
sorry where's my list here

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,519
so yeah on one side of the first

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,099
question is basically why are you using

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,969
blockchain in your project and what how

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:30,849
did you get started with that okay so

00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:33,159
well I'm not actually using blockchain

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:37,000
in a project I'm sort of a consultant

00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:38,709
and I look at a lot of property and

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,260
projects you know other people's

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,099
projects how did I get started with

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,049
blockchain

00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,260
well I'm come from a distributed systems

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:49,450
background and you know we were already

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,849
working on consensus protocols and

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,849
fault-tolerance replicated databases

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,349
back in the early 2000s but people were

00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,720
working on that much earlier but I was

00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:01,510
in the early two-thousands so it's just

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:07,180
a natural continuation of my earlier

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:10,269
research yeah so my project basically

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,150
get going it started off more as an open

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,760
source project so all like including my

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,560
CEO me and most of the other teammates

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,569
we have been involved in Oh pizzas for

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,280
quite some time and we all knew that

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,959
sustainability was the problem in open

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,889
source so we started off as solving

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
sustainability problem in open source

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,780
and blocked and seemed like a good way

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,669
of doing that because anyways blocked

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,609
and allowed you like I said as a

00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,199
technical stack it allows us to change

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:41,190
the transactional state or a

00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:44,650
programmatic change into financial

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,590
rewards right so that's why we feel that

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,079
blockchain is a good way of solving the

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,609
sustainability problem in open source so

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,340
that's how we started off with

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:58,120
blockchain and our application basically

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,829
is open source in itself as well so get

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,449
kind if you go to github you will see

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,139
that it's the source code is basically

00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:07,299
open source and it's the platform mostly

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,949
is a centralized django application but

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,010
then we use blocks in for the stake

00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:16,389
holding parts and the funding process so

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:19,180
yeah that's how we got started so

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,099
regarding me you may say me as a

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,470
blockchain enthusiast because being an

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,900
open source developer I

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,340
must be open to all the technologies and

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,660
the Saints blockchain and machine

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,360
learning those are very much booming

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,160
technologies so if I want to succeed

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,860
myself or ever want to take my knowledge

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,810
further then definitely having no in

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,360
this technology or having a know-how in

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,240
this technology is really important for

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,710
me so having this gob chin and relating

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,170
it to the various industries like I had

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,760
been working in the insurance in the

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,680
healthcare in the media realizing

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,300
yourself so basically what are the

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,890
problems in those industries and how

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,720
exactly blockchain can leverage the

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,910
security in those that is one of the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,290
major concern and if we can enhance more

00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,340
security in it and that will be a really

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,250
great option to do so

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,230
so yes love chain can be used as a

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,550
security and basically my personal

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,080
experience with it is very rarely good

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,060
basically if we can implement our

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,570
existing know how because blockchain as

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,740
I said that it's a concept and that can

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,270
be implemented with the existing

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,640
architecture be it cloud or bit the

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,050
infrastructure to leverage or to make

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,600
the existing architecture even more

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:27,120
efficient and what exactly it is now so

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:31,350
yeah hi my name is jor-el personally I'm

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,550
using browman for research projects for

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,940
couple years then I funky fraud an open

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,520
source project here in Singapore and I

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,280
breathed that repression technology can

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,169
benefits the internet-of-things industry

00:05:44,280 --> 00:06:02,730
for many areas such as data trust Roz

00:05:49,169 --> 00:06:06,330
courage and security so how do you see

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:10,590
in your work the relationship between

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:14,130
blockchain and free software yeah well

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:17,490
most of the projects I see I I see are

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,710
actually open source and they do want to

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,930
make money so often there are I say I

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,490
was involved and and you know you

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,540
mentioned there's a bit of a conflict

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:31,860
but you might say that's why but

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,990
but but that gently opens us in terms of

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,420
I look at this also from a cybersecurity

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,730
point of view and and you know I'm a

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,420
smart contract auditor and and I think

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,210
it's it's essential these projects

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,090
should all be open-source from a

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,740
security point of view and also from you

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,000
know replacing our trust in these

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,940
protocols and projects we are

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,010
eliminating third parties with a

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,220
protocol so we have to be able to see

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,110
what is protocol does so yeah I think

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:10,350
most projects are actually open source

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:12,450
and they should be yeah so I'll talk

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,550
about so when we say free software like

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,350
we all know it's not really about that

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,020
it's not supposed to be any talk about

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,570
money it's a it's more about the freedom

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,940
right so it's about distribution it's

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,220
about the decentralization of everything

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,350
it's about people working from different

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,290
parts of the world and that's kind of

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,080
the underlying thing of blocked in as

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,970
well the idea itself the concept itself

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,070
comes from the decentralization of the

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,230
things so I like saying blocks and more

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,160
like from a decentralization perspective

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,330
than a security perspective so I guess

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,060
the underlying principles are very

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,420
similar so it's about money and then

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,610
open-source we say free but it's about

00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,980
freedom then men though many people

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,810
think that open source means that it has

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,030
to be free but it doesn't necessarily

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,120
need to be free it's more about the

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,280
freedom of the things so I guess they

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,020
are kind of connected in that way that

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,860
they have similar kind of principles

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,340
it's just that many of the open-source

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,000
people say I feel that me it's kind of

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,070
like marketed in a very wrong way or

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,740
told in a wrong way by many people

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,390
because since mostly when we talk about

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,130
blocks and the thing that comes to our

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,110
mind is crypto currencies or tokens

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,630
rather than it being a technology stack

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,960
solving maybe IOT problems or making

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,510
sustainability problems so I guess

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,120
that's why it's thought of as like not

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,630
so open-source friendly but I guess at

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,169
the end of the day most of

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,600
Bloxom projects are also open source and

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:52,000
so yeah those are pretty good connected

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:54,250
in between right I would like to see

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,290
this blockchain from a bit noble

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,540
perspective because the reason being I

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,030
belong to a country where agriculture is

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,730
the primary occupation and still the

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,080
farmers are committing suicide because

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,880
they are not able to pay their tips and

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,350
the main reason for this is being

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,820
they're being cheated or worth being

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,320
fooled on by the landlords that the

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,410
depths are still remaining that are

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,630
already created so imagine in such a

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,340
kind of country where maybe an

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,830
agricultural insurance will be health

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,140
care and these sectors have a lot of

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,640
people surrounding it so in that case if

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,310
you're not going to build a trust over

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,090
here then those administration becomes

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,100
absolutely futile and having liberation

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,710
technology like blockchain which can in

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,380
built have a trust factor in it a secure

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,840
factor in it then we can be able to have

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,880
the basics or they at least the primary

00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,040
occupation of the country being

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,190
leveraged to a very secure and trusted

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,600
channel so he has blockchain it's first

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,150
of all it should be open source because

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,060
that will cater to a wide variety of

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:57,580
developers the especially end users and

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,890
it will help them making a life a bit a

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,750
bit more simpler than what it does now

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,870
rather in in many case in many rural

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,310
areas where people are able to actually

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,530
leverage these technologies or harvester

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,920
technologies or at least this blockchain

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:17,350
can help getting a next step or a step

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,700
ahead than what it is now yes I still

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,870
know properly it's people join the

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:26,260
Proteus ecosystem for rewards but I want

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:29,500
to be rich actually most of them become

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,490
millionaires due to mining bitcoins and

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,180
Assyrians

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,490
so from my own perspective ageless

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,580
to running a sustainable open-source

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,640
project we really need a prey from such

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,700
a skill coin it's because the key hub is

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,880
a open source community platform for

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,030
managing open source projects but we

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,000
actually need a platform

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,250
the coin to running a good party

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,010
programs because a good party program

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:04,330
help us to be a sustainable production

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:06,900
ecosystem but I think people join any

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:12,580
branch and open-source project for

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:16,350
rewards and now I really wish to country

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:19,150
open-source projects we use sorry that

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,360
smackin govt surgeon to write the apps

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,540
but actually we didn't check other

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:35,980
source code for asourian and make any

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:38,500
contributions all right let's get a

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:43,750
little bit more technical how do you

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:46,300
specifically use existing free software

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,120
and open source in your project or in

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,950
your work with the projects that you're

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,130
working with okay so well from my point

00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:00,100
of view there two things when I ordered

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,250
a project I obviously use free software

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,380
free open-source software for all the

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,810
tooling you know system starting from

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:12,910
the text editor and a static analytics

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:15,610
tool tools but in general you know all

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,340
these projects they built on free open

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,010
source and you know if you build on the

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,960
syrian platform you're using a lot of

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:27,790
tools and the actual protocol which is

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:30,100
open sourced and indeed in general i

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,810
think in in any type of software it's

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,340
it's very difficult to develop these

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,240
days without using open source you know

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,620
the api's that you used to access the

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,980
platforms that they generally open

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,310
source lee the the front-end libraries

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:52,000
everything so yeah if that answers a

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:54,250
question City I see it everywhere - I

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,230
agree with Stefan right for example with

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,360
get currently most of the blocks in

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,370
projects if it's not just a white paper

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,290
or token or a smart contract which has

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,770
just been written out there for someone

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,840
to use Sunday

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,490
a token which just says that this token

00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,250
is built on this principle and it's

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,350
actual practical does nothing apart from

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,540
people buying it and stuff so if you are

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,100
actually making a project a blocked in

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,840
project where you can reuse the

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,440
blockchain technology it has to have

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,890
some kind of application right even for

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,900
as simple as making a browser blocked

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,940
and enabled or web channel build as we

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,250
say we use a project of meta mask which

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,930
uses Chrome extensions or Mozilla

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,550
extensions which are written in

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,490
JavaScript which is again open source

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,740
project right we in get con the entire

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,900
kit coin is written in Django so Django

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,790
is an open source project we use jQuery

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,790
in front-end so jQuery is again an open

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,250
source project then we use Linux servers

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,780
for deployment of the entire get grant

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,000
platform which is again an open source

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,950
project so when you finally create a

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,660
project out of it where you are using

00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,880
the blockchain anywhere so you will

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,310
definitely more or less use open source

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,020
project like I was saying in my slides

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,690
like even the closed source companies

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,460
that we have kind of directly or

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,290
indirectly would be using open source

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,270
projects for making their application so

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,740
as to say so it's not like that if you

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,190
are a blocked in application you are

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,720
gonna avoid or not use open source

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,250
projects you are definitely gonna use

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,500
open source projects and most of the

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,810
blocks in projects that are there use

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,670
some kind of reactor Django or some kind

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,400
of language to build a platform that

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,440
where you can go and use a blockchain in

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,480
itself right so which is written in some

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,730
kind of open source project and probably

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,730
deployed in a Linux server or it's an

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:42,650
Android application so it has open

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:44,510
source involved in it anyways right to

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,490
take this discussion forward as

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,140
sub-second already mentioned in its

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,610
previous talk that whether we know what

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,170
is open source of it don't know what is

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,580
open source but we definitely use open

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,620
source without being realizing so

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,120
because we are wherever it whatever our

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,800
project we are working in we are

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,770
surrounded by these technologies that we

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,470
inherent or implicitly definitely use

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,560
use them so as far as I am concerned I'm

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,320
a Java developer so I have definitely

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,690
used all the api's and everything

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,740
and also I'm into machine learning so

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,310
basically two technologies like

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,110
tensorflow and all the opencv etc so I

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,940
am using those to basically create

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:23,410
something like object detection and

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:26,500
image recognition etc so yes I use open

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:31,090
source widely and in definitely in

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:35,610
support of it we are using open source

00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:37,810
projects such as nurtures theaters

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,760
especially I've seen the most important

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,900
parts of our open source because she's

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,310
done easily community so as I mentioned

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,330
couple minutes ago

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,010
I think the most important thing is to

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:54,040
to bring people to open source

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,730
developers into our projects but

00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:01,900
actually we cannot make until now

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:06,400
because of many people join the project

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:11,110
or system for mining coins not really to

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,290
country contributor open source

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,720
Cummins and even they didn't express

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,930
their interest in contributing and

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,220
approach browser open source projects so

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:27,610
I think the major problem it's it's a

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,340
culture of a fraction because it's not

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:40,240
really the problem of the open source

00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:42,100
project so the last question was how to

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,340
use force in your project and since you

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,990
don't have a project we can jump

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,750
straight to the next question and that

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,790
one was not on the list so based on what

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,930
you just said about people joining

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:59,860
projects for mining and so I would like

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,240
to ask now in the in the last year there

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,270
has been a lot of change in the

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,329
perception of blockchain and Bitcoin

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:10,300
because of the value drop and so on

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:16,120
so I would like to ask do you see a

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:19,490
change in the perception of the projects

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,190
or in the attitude of the

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:27,770
the developers or creators of the

00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:29,570
projects in the last year or do you see

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:34,700
a change in the future what what are

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:39,020
your thoughts on that yeah tricky

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,790
question I don't think there's a big

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,700
change in attitude

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:46,280
I mean projects generally want to make

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,890
money and get funded that's you know

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,050
when you create a company and you decide

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,960
to do something based on blockchain

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:59,110
otherwise you need funding usually and

00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,610
the last couple of years we've seen

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,590
everyone do an ICO because that was the

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,860
easiest way to get money so you do

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,500
crowdfunding before that startups went

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,030
to do venture capital now they're either

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,690
going back to venture capital or they

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:16,520
talked about the security token offering

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:20,000
but but in the end the goal is to fund

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,070
their development you know that might be

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,290
at odds with some of the free

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,240
open-source principles but but a lot of

00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,330
these projects are about startups and

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,190
and making money so I don't think that

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,830
has changed and I don't think that's

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,650
likely to change soon obviously there's

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,040
also a lot of misconceptions on you know

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,990
cryptocurrencies tokens and what is

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,840
Bitcoin and and what does it have to do

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:50,390
with blockchain but but you know that

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:52,010
that's slightly related only yeah I

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,590
completely agree like most of the

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:57,230
startup projects so it will be needing

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,970
some kind of funding and based on what

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,130
happened like the last few months which

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,050
which we are like calling the crypto

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,240
into kind of a thing where everything is

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:08,090
going down and stuff so maybe there are

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,670
not many billionaires who can like just

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,890
throw away money to any of the blocks in

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,440
project that's coming up so many of the

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,140
companies the people who throw away the

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,240
money of blocks and are kind of thinking

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,880
more consciously okay whether we should

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,330
be funding this project or not but I

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,550
guess in a way it's gonna reduce the

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,460
amount of people who thought just like

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,680
so it's as good and bad but

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,260
the bad part is obviously maybe many of

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,180
the good projects might now need other

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,310
ways of getting funding and stuff but a

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,800
good part is also that many people who

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:45,280
just thought of it as a investment plan

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,320
for their future so many people will now

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
be using blocks and I guess more like a

00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,090
technology stack rather than just an

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,310
investment plan of like but Hotaling

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,400
what we call in blocks in right we just

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:59,680
hope a new coin right like we buy

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,410
aetherium and keep it and hope that it

00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,170
goes up and then it's a retirement plan

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,270
or so as to say but now maybe they will

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,090
be more like building on blockchain

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,220
which is like using the technology stack

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,810
and trying to make more of stuffs out of

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,330
blocks and then use it in a practical

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:20,620
applications rather than just thinking

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,180
of it as a money source this question

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,790
basically reminded me of one of my

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,710
incidents so when I basically heard this

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,240
word bit counter the first time and I

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,710
went to a sphere of my fellow developers

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,870
that what exactly it is anyone knows

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,030
about it so one answer I received is

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,470
like but bitcoin is or cryptocurrency is

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,290
something which talk people use is none

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,290
of our concern so what I mean to say is

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,300
that it blockchain or these technologies

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,130
will take some time to sink in so it

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,480
just like our internet when it was

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,340
launched around it when it came into

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,020
being around 25 years ago it did not

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,610
became or it did not be famous at the

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,160
first month or the first year it

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,830
basically through various applications

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,110
or through various waves basically it

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,030
went to the developers and went to the

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,910
end-users so it depends on our

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,620
enthusiasm that how exactly we want to

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,200
dive deep into a particular concept and

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,660
how exactly we would allow ourselves to

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,480
research on these further in this aspect

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,070
so even though having a variety of usage

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,460
unless and until we are giving the

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,960
end-users a confirmation that yes or the

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,130
trusted applications or more secure

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,470
applications can be built using

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,620
blockchain and if you are not able to do

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,750
to develop prototype or develop a sample

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,440
application for them which actually will

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,259
benefit them then only it will be

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,419
possible for a developer or contributor

00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:43,889
to enhance or promote the advocacy of

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:47,340
blockchain yeah I think last year winter

00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:49,919
of critter currency people left the

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:55,860
kwhitaker engine market because the

00:21:49,919 --> 00:22:01,289
price was very bad that's they led brief

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:03,779
that the multi peer was come by these

00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,940
couple months is and then compared to

00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:10,799
the acquittal marquee fallenness trends

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:16,350
to make more money not really expect to

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:21,870
use the protein technologies so for me I

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,200
didn't see any changes as well was the

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,960
question

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,210
cryptocurrencies blockchains order to

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,759
deliver generally it's a little you

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:35,879
asking doctrine generally for example

00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:39,899
yeah I said I'm not terribly firstly the

00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:43,080
way about the sort of changing fortunes

00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:45,690
of people who pump up pursue or burst

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,240
bubbles it seems a spectacularly

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:51,799
unimportant it does create short-term

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,799
problems sure we've seen that before

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:59,129
what I think that cryptocurrencies are

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,899
only a subset of blockchains lbf

00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,059
currently a fairly large subset but

00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:06,809
Piper ledger has been sort of grinding

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,740
away on on other problems that don't

00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:11,309
have any thing at all

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,389
ormaline super currency but not yet

00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,419
convinced either way they're good ideas

00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:16,950
but they're largely unaffected so it is

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,220
strictly cryptocurrencies that have been

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,480
sort of subject to this bubble bursting

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,809
type behavior

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:32,059
I have finally allowed myself to become

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:36,210
an adviser to a blockchain company what

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:38,659
I pulled to me in them was that they are

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,800
from the outset running a business

00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:42,510
meaning

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,770
organizing people and systems and

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,190
resources to deliver something of value

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:49,140
to customers who give you money of

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,970
investors not speculators not pcs not

00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,080
put it but customers so who's receiving

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,480
the thing that you are producing and

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,280
paying you for it

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,200
what I'd suggest that the cryptocurrency

00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,420
winter will do is allow resources to

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,300
shift back to company's founders

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,420
developers GPU supply I subpoena an

00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,560
actual issue to move back to other

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,360
things that are actually more valuable

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,000
and so in that respect I would say it's

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:23,310
a sort of gradual improvement but you're

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:25,320
not a gigantic effect yeah I'd like to

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:29,160
dig deeper into exactly what you just

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:32,970
said so the the cryptocurrencies are the

00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:36,690
ones are that are losing whereas the

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,340
rest stays the same is it but I'd like

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,740
to ask everybody else you really think

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,400
that is the case or are other projects

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:48,000
that are not cryptocurrency focused

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:51,420
suffering from the the down hype so to

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,610
speak from the negative publicity that

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:58,530
is coming now or not what is your

00:24:53,610 --> 00:25:00,870
thought on that I'm not entirely sure

00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:04,880
that there are two aspects to this first

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,160
of all obviously it if you wanted to

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,160
start a project now based on blockchain

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,780
it'd be a harder sell to the general

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,450
public

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:21,650
mm-hmm but on the other hand it might

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:24,960
also be you know I think we see a lot of

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,840
really poor projects that have

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:33,020
disappeared and and we we get better

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,510
quality projects now so yeah

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:42,510
cryptocurrencies have been affected

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:46,130
startups have been affected but not not

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,130
only in a bad way I mean

00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:52,410
yeah so means I agree with him that many

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,350
of the projects which like many of the

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,549
projects have faded away as such and

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,309
many of the good projects have stayed

00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:01,500
back but I do agree with ruolan he said

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,419
like I don't believe personally and it's

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,030
nothing to do with my campaign company's

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,130
opinion but I don't believe that blocked

00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,169
in solves everything it's not like that

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,630
unified string theory kind of a thing

00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,150
that solves all the problems right so

00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,860
it's not like that every time there is

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,480
something okay I have to make it in

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,790
block so it's not like that you don't

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,890
use PostgreSQL for all your data bases

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,960
you don't write javascript in your

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,030
back-end all the time so it's similarly

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,890
blocked and you don't use blocks in for

00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,179
any problem that is shown to you so I

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,880
don't believe in the blockchain

00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,530
everything principle that many of the

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,630
blocks an ecosystem people believe in

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,429
right so there is all these projects

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,500
which have a particular thing that

00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:42,960
should be used there are applications I

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,150
believe web blockchain helps maybe in

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,970
trust applications and stuff like that

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,040
but it's and I believe those projects

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,970
will still stay because that's a

00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:56,610
technical they there it has been used as

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,559
particularly application which has the

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:02,880
features that are needed for the trust

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,940
improvement and not like just for using

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,580
of money similarly in get coin we didn't

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,740
really see but we might like I at least

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,679
hope that me like not hoped but I

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,299
thought that maybe because of the script

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,760
of into people might have a negative

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:20,760
feeling of earning in form of blocks and

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,530
because we are but like finally funding

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,570
the projects in the form of ERC go into

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,720
tokens so it might not have been as

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:30,030
attractive of earning in aetherium as it

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,040
was one year back or like two years back

00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,720
then it is now but we didn't really see

00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,000
massive change in that way that

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,710
contributors are no longer contributing

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,950
to the projects because it's in

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,870
blockchain which is a good thing like I

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:50,280
thought maybe that would happen but that

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:52,860
didn't happen and yeah it's like so for

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,440
me it's not new right because for me

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,400
like I work in a us-based company so I

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,040
earn

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,950
US dollars and which gets converted to

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,680
Indian rupees so I have always faced

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,570
this US dollar and Indian rupees values

00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,660
going up and down up and down up and

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,490
down so it's very similar to that if I

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,470
think of it right it's very kind of

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,690
similar to that it might blocked in the

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,430
currencies might again go up and people

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,220
might again come back to it and all the

00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,350
stuffs but it's practically to be used

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,360
where it's supposed to be used and not

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,610
just thrown away everywhere so I guess

00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,530
all these projects and many of the

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,260
projects I've seen in the ecosystem are

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,160
using blockchain so they are like okay

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,230
and have a lot of

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,120
etherium lying about what do i do i will

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,620
make a project on a particular

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,720
marketplace which i don't even know

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,220
about how the marketplace works so this

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,930
is something i've seen again and again

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,750
happening and this kind of projects

00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,730
would have anyways gone down with a bit

00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:50,820
the crypto winter came out didn't come

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:53,030
right so I guess yeah so whichever

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,430
projects they used blocked in because

00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,740
blocked and made sense in using in that

00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,600
project I guess they will still stay

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,790
because they are not really dependent on

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:07,140
the crypto currency aspect of it right I

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,090
have might have a bit different opinion

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,560
about it so basically from whatever I

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,270
have analyzed or whatever I have kind of

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,560
researched about it I some very feel

00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,600
their crypto currency might be the

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,580
future so if any technology or if any

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,380
organization is not adopting crypto

00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,980
currency now then they have will have to

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,350
do it sometime later so it is beneficial

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,530
to have a bit open-minded in that case

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,810
that since if even though right now I'm

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:34,080
not using a technology but if it can be

00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,570
the future then in that case I should be

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,460
ready enough to exchange my current

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:42,780
architecture to incorporate the

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:47,040
technology as well okay I don't know

00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:52,410
it's a heart for me but you know many of

00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:56,210
my friends in Asia they create stopped

00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:01,220
because represent energy it's a hot tub

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:03,930
meaning it's a fashion because for

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,770
entrepreneurs who create stop doing

00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:10,070
project companies they cans then reckons

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:14,870
it right here

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:17,840
give presentations and run me away they

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:21,050
were writing lots of high papers and

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,560
they were running the row shows around

00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:31,190
the world so they feel such things are

00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:33,350
very efficient so I don't know yeah bit

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,690
speculative for me I would I said that

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:39,980
the other applications are sometimes a

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,200
bit questionable and yes a good fashion

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,610
others are probably I was going to say

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,620
sort of a halo effect because of

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,450
cryptocurrencies but but fashion is is

00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,600
as accurate a way to describe the

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:53,720
problem that people are doing stuff both

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,390
startups or setups and corporates and

00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,710
maybe either big letters are getting

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,120
involved in blockchain projects which in

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,960
situations that really don't warrant it

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:09,560
and often because I suspect that it's

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,880
fashionable or in the setup cases a sort

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,500
of halo effect because hey you know

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,020
doctor hands are cool so investing might

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:20,600
set up so yes maybe there's an amount of

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,460
that dropping I can't quantify it but it

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,380
wouldn't be surprised me there were

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,980
places where the benefit is not

00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:32,900
necessarily obvious so point to the MAS

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,460
running a a blockchain trial but for

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,520
clearing with between the central bank

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:40,580
and the local banks the problem they're

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,970
solving is Swift Swift is appallingly

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,630
awful in sort of 1960 zero EDI

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,040
today just sort of encapsulated in JSON

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,460
so there are certainly certainly scope

00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,010
to improve some of those ancient systems

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,430
but yeah is it the right technique and

00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,660
you need to and is the tendency to do it

00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,010
being push too far forward the last

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,570
couple of years because of the the

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,460
ascent of cryptocurrencies and therefore

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,840
at least starting to recede speculative

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:18,710
yes but I don't have concrete evidence

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:20,810
it's a when Z I want to open the space

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:24,140
for for also for questions for the

00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,490
audience so that means we're going to

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,700
continue talking but if you have a

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:31,280
question please raise your hand and then

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,250
you can join the discussion or if you

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,820
have any any opinion to what we're

00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:40,870
talking about please raise your hand and

00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,870
yeah you want to say something right now

00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,280
here we go okay so I've been in a

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,770
startup accelerator for the past several

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,960
months and we've had presentations by

00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:15,170
partners from Sequoia Golden Gate

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,270
Ventures Founders Fund and the consensus

00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:21,200
has always been that blockchain is

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:23,780
cancer and startups that can't explain

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,640
how their business process is dependent

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,910
upon having a blockchain probably

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,440
haven't thought about without they can't

00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,820
explain how their business processes are

00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,350
improved by the blockchain probably

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,050
haven't thought it out too hard and

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,820
that's had a kind of a knock-on effect

00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,590
in the companies that people are

00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,630
starting in this accelerator at least

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,610
and I see people that are doing

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,030
fractionalization projects without using

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:51,470
blockchain which is kind of interesting

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:55,340
and I'm wondering if you all have seen

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,930
that yet or or if you see people

00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,210
changing their projects away from

00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,590
blockchain and just coming back to what

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,050
you're saying before like delivering

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,620
business value for the company or the

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,620
investors

00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:10,540
yeah it's a factual statement but you

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,950
know seeing just a lack of hey let

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,290
you're seeing an actual stigma yeah and

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,790
the cancer part I didn't say that like

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,560
one of the one of the partners over

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:25,149
there that's that was there words for it

00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:27,970
so okay well now we have some data yeah

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:30,310
so I kind of wanted to talk about it in

00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:33,339
a way like well and also say hello

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:37,750
effect right so it's I am not sure about

00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:39,609
the cancer part means yeah but - before

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,560
before blocked in it was a similar

00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,480
scenario with machine learning nei right

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,950
so let me start off which said that we

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,349
are using machine learning and AI if

00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,599
even if it was like - if no if

00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:51,760
conditions if else if you feel safe and

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,310
you say I have used a machine learning

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,919
project I made nei or you just wrote it

00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:59,380
as X and it gives a chatbot and you say

00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:01,300
it's an AI assistance system you're

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,210
probably gonna get funding from some big

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,550
VC and stuff right so that's I feel has

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,619
always been before that I guess it was

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:11,680
cloud then it came to machine learning

00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:13,359
here now it's blocked and surely

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,950
something new is gonna come again after

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,550
some time because crypto winter is

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:20,740
already here so that hello effect is

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,540
kind of always there in startups and

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,079
everywhere right so I like to call them

00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,329
keywords so it's like in keywords you

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,510
use these keywords to get funding out of

00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:34,030
it so many of the projects do use that

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,040
it's not like there are no other

00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,050
alternatives of doing something which

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,089
you can do it with blocks in right there

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,710
are always different other alternatives

00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:45,819
and you should be considering different

00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:48,280
ways of doing things and it's so yeah

00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:49,930
many of the projects I believe do that

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,349
just to get the funding part of it or

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:56,349
because it's trendy but not because it's

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:58,900
actually needed in the project so that

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,760
is there and I have seen that happen in

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,579
the ecosystem again and again yet so

00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,880
that's true but I am not sure I would go

00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:08,650
ahead to call it a cancer but yeah I

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,589
hope that answers your guessin to some

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:15,670
extent so just to have one point to add

00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,740
to his so

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,030
regarding blockchain I am not sure if

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,620
that might be the case because

00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,050
blockchain itself is an expensive

00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,460
technology that we cannot use in just

00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,350
for show off and without any purpose

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,050
and as far as the startup is concerned

00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:32,720
if there is any heavenly investor who

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,070
just is ready to fund fund the startup

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,220
without knowing what exactly they're

00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,570
going to do with the funding then that

00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,880
that that will be the best case but I

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,520
don't think any investor don't do that

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,260
so especially having the incorporating

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,780
technology like blockchain without

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:57,850
having any materialistic use of it would

00:36:47,780 --> 00:37:01,000
be would not be that often scenario okay

00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,980
so to latched onto that you said

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:10,040
somebody here said blockchain winter and

00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:13,970
you say blockchain is cancer do you

00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,930
think the blockchain winter is helping

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:21,830
us to fight the blockchain cancer or is

00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:27,200
it making it worse anybody want to jump

00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:29,630
to this question well in the ecosystem

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,820
we are saying that the crypto spring is

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,880
coming and like Game of Thrones winter

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,730
is coming but I'm not sure how long this

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,430
winter run Silla unlike in Game of

00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,560
Thrones

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,890
[Music]

00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,680
I don't know like I said like this

00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:48,950
surely clears out a lot of the noise

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,810
right so I would say that because of the

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,090
winter it would clear out a lot of the

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,850
noise and many of the projects that

00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,500
remain would actually be good projects

00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,360
like he said that many of the projects

00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,310
which actually need blocking would still

00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,960
be there because they are noted for the

00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,490
technology itself they don't need it

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,610
because it was a money-making machine

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:09,920
for them right so and that way I would

00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:12,920
say that crypto vinter to some extent

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,830
acts as that apocalypse thing that we

00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,870
all often have the reset button that the

00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,099
mother nature uses sometimes to cleanse

00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,369
the earth

00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:23,930
it's something like that where we can be

00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,819
like okay the Kryptonian the kind of

00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,380
clears out all the noises and all the

00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:30,170
pollutions that we had in the block

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,119
technical system and all the good things

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:35,089
that were there for the project's itself

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,369
stays on so yeah I feel that it might

00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:44,329
have some effect in fighting the cancer

00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:46,390
but yeah so you know occasionally

00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:48,680
Gartner comes up with something useful

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,710
the the thing I'd point to at the moment

00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,029
in this case is the Gartner hype cycle

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,730
there's a curve that looks sort of like

00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:59,450
this we've got you know initial

00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:01,609
excitement over the top expectations the

00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,309
trough of disillusionment and then a

00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:07,400
sort of gradual climb into normalization

00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:09,589
and then I'd suggest the crypto winter

00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,089
is just a trough of disillusionment for

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:13,089
this particular character ecology

00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:28,840
middle finger hello

00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,910
yeah I feel the same like a graph I

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,790
think now we will we are at the

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:38,050
normalization climbing up the

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:41,320
normalization graph of it I think the

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:44,380
Linux Foundation is coming and coming up

00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:48,420
with hyper ledger and some of the artery

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:53,280
code rahu are forming and financial

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:55,510
consortium to customize the blockchain

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,440
solution to fit into the enterprise

00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:01,650
needs and I really I think now the

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,840
enterprises or looking into it and

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:08,100
seeing how this can be adopted

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,960
definitely the public blockchain is not

00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,790
suitable for the enterprises to take it

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,410
off straight away I think that is

00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:18,190
already a customization of the

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:20,850
blockchain is going on a few high-level

00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:23,730
things I would see is

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:26,619
business-to-business interface

00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:28,960
interfacing framework I think that's

00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:32,890
where I'm seeing blockchain is going

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,710
towards where it can form like an

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,770
business-to-business integration

00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:41,080
framework on the other side some sharing

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,510
of information across the industry

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,010
I think there are already projects on

00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:50,109
the KYC sharings where you have already

00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:52,510
kyc information is verified by someone

00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:54,340
and all the banks doesn't need to do the

00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,830
same work again so they wanted to share

00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,859
the informations they're already finding

00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:02,380
out some real use cases of it and there

00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:06,520
is one more area on independent

00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:09,340
currencies for an ecosystem for example

00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,930
the full industries or the transport

00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:15,700
industries they can come up with their

00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:19,359
own currencies to use it across the

00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:21,640
different things but I something related

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,119
to the loyalty points we're in now the

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,580
Kings drinking flyer is already going

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,100
into the blockchain to exchange the

00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,370
loyalty points

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,530
other loyalty systems where they can

00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:37,740
exchange the informations I think

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:40,950
there's already the industry use cases

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:44,130
or coming in some serious investments or

00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:49,430
going on on the blockchain so one thing

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:52,860
I really feel is like whether there is a

00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:56,010
value proportion has been rightly found

00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,810
out or not that is these are all the use

00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,360
cases which could be achieved by

00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:03,660
different technologies and different

00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,290
ways that we are doing now whether the

00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:09,630
blockchain can provide that value

00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:12,240
proportion instead of doing it the other

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,040
way like distributor technology or

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,620
whether the blockchain can provide the

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:22,250
value proportion before the real

00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:25,190
question I believe it's just that the

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:30,750
figure is named the IBM speaker on

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:35,340
Thursday no doubt there's other six or

00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:38,040
eight criteria for identifying projects

00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,390
that were candidates for blockchains

00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,310
now generally this is high polity based

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:46,800
but it's the thinking was broader than

00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:49,290
that and I think that sort of is a more

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,100
finely spells out variant of what you're

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:56,640
saying if you don't take at least these

00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,780
six boxes then you'll give up now you're

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,390
almost certainly better off with the

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,820
trustee who's trusted they're all bonded

00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:06,180
or in some other way

00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:08,720
constrained to become trustworthy only

00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:12,090
once you've got a situation where

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,320
probably all six don't apply then yes it

00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:17,280
starts to make sense to look at a

00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:20,460
blockchain and at that point either

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,650
though running costs or the risks drop

00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,660
to the point where there's a there's

00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,020
economic value being created and yes

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,340
then the parties can argue about who

00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:34,040
should get how much of the newly created

00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,040
by so it's happening that's good to see

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,009
yeah I think there's a big difference

00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:44,740
between the practice in the theory in

00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:46,420
theory blockchain can bring a lot to to

00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,170
these sort of enterprise networks you

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,210
described and there's a lot of adoption

00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,789
and and there are two types of adoptions

00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:57,279
that there are companies and enterprise

00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:59,680
network said that sort of get on the

00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:01,779
bandwagon as well and and really don't

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,930
know what to use it for and you know

00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:10,390
sort of force issue but what are some

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:12,220
really good ideas and you know if you

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:15,309
look at supply chain for example the

00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,710
theory of of what the blockchain can do

00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,240
to pick supply chain is it's very clear

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,609
you know everyone agrees of the

00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,680
advantages but then you see companies

00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:25,269
trying to implement this and and you

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,519
know you've seen in there's a big key

00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:30,069
use case with IBM and masks for

00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,869
International shipping I think which you

00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:35,589
know it's a basically difficult to to

00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:38,230
actually get to work in practice and for

00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:40,539
a number of reasons one it's difficult

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,099
to get anyone everyone to agree on the

00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:45,069
common protocol and to get everyone

00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:47,289
involved and and second we just don't

00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:52,019
know how to do these things properly and

00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:55,240
and there a lot of proof of concepts

00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:57,220
being presented as successes and and I

00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:03,160
don't think there are all such

00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:05,019
successful examples so again with all

00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,710
new technology you know you have to be

00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:10,690
careful what works and what doesn't and

00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,430
and thinks it might look like a really

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:14,289
good idea don't actually work in

00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,730
practice in the other way around you

00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:17,859
know some some things that are a bad

00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:24,579
idea really take off you know that

00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:26,950
always happens so yeah means I would

00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:31,230
also agree it's not about exactly I feel

00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:33,400
that it's not more about the industry or

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,740
particular places where we can apply

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,660
it's more about the reason why you where

00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,549
you're using the block generate like he

00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,430
said the six boxes that you need to take

00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:43,930
so this is I would tell an experience I

00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,680
had in the hackathon where I was

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:48,950
mentoring in

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,160
so one of the projects when a group date

00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,620
was like about investigation report

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,170
filing in theft so what they said is

00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,930
like and the application that the maid

00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,820
was because there have been theft

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,620
reports or investigation reports for

00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,720
other reasons which have been

00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:09,410
manipulated by the police or someone

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,990
like that right and they made prod to be

00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:16,010
very simple it's it was built on blocked

00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:18,590
in and to ensure that any kind of

00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,780
manipulation becomes a transaction and

00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,550
the transaction is openly visible to

00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,440
everyone so anyone who makes a

00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:26,470
transactional change to the

00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,090
investigation report that was filed

00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:32,540
basically it can be tracked back to

00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:34,820
whoever made the changes so I can kind

00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,610
of understand the use of blocks and over

00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,860
there because it's it's you're taking

00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:42,650
some of the boxes right but then another

00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:46,520
project it basically was like okay we

00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:48,680
are using RSA encryption but since

00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,050
everyone says blockchain is more secure

00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:54,470
so we will be using blockchain now

00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:57,260
that's some my question is because

00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,480
finally the encryption algorithms that

00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,270
are used in RSA or in blocks in a kind

00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,700
of similar right so the underlying

00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,290
cryptography is more or less similar but

00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,540
many people would be use to make it

00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,980
secure just because it has been trendy

00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,850
that locks in makes everything more

00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:16,310
secure so I guess the reason why you're

00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:18,140
using blocks and also plays an important

00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:23,870
role in wherever the project you are

00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:25,430
using blocks in itself so we have less

00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,130
than ten minutes left so I want to bring

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:34,910
the topic back to free software and open

00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:37,480
source and ask you how can every

00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:41,900
software community benefit from

00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,610
blockchain work now a year ago would

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,860
have said there's a lot of money in

00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:48,320
blockchain so we can use it to fund a

00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:50,810
free software development so that's

00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:54,040
changing so what is left or what what

00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,040
are the benefits now

00:47:54,290 --> 00:48:00,770
well it has changed in a way that I cos

00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:03,110
are not as successful anymore but you

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:07,750
know it's still a way of doing funding

00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:10,010
in in sort of a decentralized or

00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:13,570
democratic way you know you can you can

00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:17,690
actually get a project funded somehow

00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:20,360
using smart contract based crowdfunding

00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,790
you can call it an ICO an sto or

00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,440
whatever you can still do that and and

00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,320
and you can get

00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,330
get funding and and it's different

00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,440
funding you know it's its funding anyone

00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:35,060
can participate and in most countries in

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,510
some countries it you have to be

00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:40,880
accredited investor but but it's still

00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:45,340
possible and obviously then there are

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:49,430
projects such as get coin which you know

00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:51,170
which sort of take this open this up

00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,700
much more I mean you you you you

00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,920
probably more qualified to talk about

00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:58,940
this but the way I see it it's it's it's

00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,880
a bit like a never open I see over you

00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:06,430
can just ask for money in in any way you

00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,430
want and and and get projects funded

00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:16,100
yeah so I also feel that like like the

00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:18,650
thing is we never talk like this about

00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:22,040
other projects right like we don't see

00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:24,350
so yeah Python will spite and still

00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,780
important and open source or like C is

00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:28,370
important in open source so I guess in

00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,440
similar ways we shouldn't be saying

00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:34,280
about why blockchain is important in

00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:38,180
open source versus a so I would say that

00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,830
it still uses like it can be used varied

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,920
ly in different projects if it needs to

00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:45,890
be used if the application asks for the

00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,590
use of it and also blocks and enables

00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:51,050
you still it and like you can maybe the

00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,820
money factor isn't big but the important

00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,650
part about blockchain into health helps

00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,540
you to programmatically like put a

00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,550
financial benefit to the programmatic

00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,410
transaction of any kind which is where

00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:03,890
get coin is also using blocks and right

00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:05,990
so like we kind of change our state of

00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,390
an open source issue and pull request is

00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,000
what we decide

00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,579
as a blocks and transaction right so if

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,549
someone starting walk on an issue to

00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:17,920
someone sending up will request or the

00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:19,390
politicus getting marked now this can be

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,059
tracked as a transaction states

00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:24,819
different transaction states and then

00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:27,730
the final financial benefits comes out

00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:30,220
of it so there are different ways how it

00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:33,910
comes it's not basically like just about

00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:37,829
the money thing or the value of a

00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,829
particular coin going up but now -

00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:43,089
according to a blockchain is more offer

00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,440
with respect to the free and open source

00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:46,329
communities auction is more of the

00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,980
things which they need to implement it

00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:50,710
in order to make their system even

00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,960
better secure because as we know v

00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,779
wherever of decentralization we were

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,160
ever of the encryption and other

00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:59,740
technologies but putting it all together

00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,440
it is something blockchain I would

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,210
suggest so it's like using whatever

00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,430
resources we are having and a technology

00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,289
which you want to add up to in a more

00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:13,029
managed in a more managed or in a more

00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:15,190
efficient way without without ensuring

00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:18,160
that none of these resources go futile

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,970
that is what the open-source communities

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:24,549
need to focus on okay yeah from

00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:29,640
high-level view the open-source

00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:33,430
developers can get benefits from ICO and

00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:37,180
other open-source manning's especially

00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:40,000
we can use traverse such a story 32

00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:43,180
issue our own critical issue our own

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,269
tokens and there are other men in Krita

00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:51,819
currency preference except the Serbian

00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:54,539
for such purpose so I think it's very

00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:57,609
different from ten years ago

00:51:54,539 --> 00:52:00,309
open-source developers can only get

00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:03,640
funds from traditional investors and

00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:06,309
pick a big funds but it's quite

00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,950
different now you can guess more money I

00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:12,910
mean meaningless star money to fund

00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:17,109
companies from Crete all funds and other

00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:19,990
individual crypto investors so I think

00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:22,710
this is a very good news foreign source

00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:22,710
developers

00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:29,580
um that's a bit philosophical but I

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,940
suspect there are some some broad trends

00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:37,530
one is yeah get past the crypto winter

00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:39,180
and normalize a bit stablize a bit

00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:42,330
what's happening with cryptocurrencies

00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:44,430
and they become more broadly applicable

00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,230
as a means of direct payment for

00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:48,600
engineering effort to get coin type

00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,880
stuff

00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,040
the second is that as we sort of climbed

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,520
this sort of left latter curve of

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,980
normalization for bok choy blockchains

00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:02,070
generally it means that the demand for

00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:04,320
engineering talent stabilizes and grows

00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:06,240
along with it and that is an opportunity

00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,010
it requires a slightly different

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,390
engagement to engage with individuals

00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:12,690
but it's an opportunity in the sense

00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:15,210
that the people they're working on

00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:17,910
things that are infrastructure companies

00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:23,490
in that situation have a recruiting need

00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:25,430
and got the tech companies better able

00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:27,660
to recruit if they are allowing the

00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:32,610
developers to contribute meaningfully to

00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:34,020
open source and free software and I have

00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:38,190
forgotten the third thing there was a

00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:42,420
third one but it's gone so I will stop

00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:44,100
it - we'd end up one minute so the

00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,500
sensor out of time basically

00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:51,870
does anybody have any last words that

00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:54,200
they want to add or any any comments

00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,200
from the audience

00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:03,550
does anybody have any comments about

00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:05,440
using blockchain for increasing

00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:08,230
governance inside of corporations and

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,310
banks and how that can be used for you

00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:13,960
know the GES scores of a company I mean

00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,090
I've just heard anecdotally that like

00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,600
people are being offered you know

00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:21,490
blockchain projects to basically use

00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,630
smart contracts to cut out a bunch of

00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:27,430
analysts inside their company okay I

00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:30,160
don't think we have time to answer that

00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:32,080
question now but that's a bigger

00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:36,880
question we can discuss out on the

00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:38,830
hallway so okay what's tough to say is

00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:43,090
thank you for coming and thank you for

00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:46,570
engaging with us and I hope we gave you

00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:48,460
an engaging discussion and I hope we you

00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:55,320
were able to take something away from

00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,320
