How does Blockchain fit into the FOSS community?

unlike many other projects that are started in the FOSS community, or where the ideals of the project are very much aligned with the FOSS community, many Blockchain projects appear to be following a different philosophy, and the fact that the Blockchain code is under a Free Software and Open Source licence is more incidental than intentional.

A selection of speakers coming to FOSSASIA will join the panel
