 Open Source Software and Open Source contributors provide for a massive percentage of today's softwares and web and other technical ecosystems. It provides a freedom and global way of contributing to make things better. However, Open Source contributions are mostly driven by intrinsic motivations. This often leads to burn out due to lack of sustainability. Gitcoin provides a solution to help all the wonderful Open Source contributors earn by doing what they do best. Gitcoin is a bountying platform which helps bounty open source issues which now the contributors can work on and also earn and sustain themselves.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
good afternoon everyone subtopics going

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,649
to talk about how we can basically pay

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,099
people with blockchain for doing open

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:14,009
source code so get on with it

00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:15,480
hello everyone so if you saw if you have

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,510
been sitting here for a while you have

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,760
seen that my laptop just crashed so I'm

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,150
using another laptop I hope everything

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,090
else works out so let's get started yeah

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,550
so this is me this is my Twitter handle

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,250
I have been an open source contributor

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,050
for some five years now and with open

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,390
source obviously community comes as an

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,160
important part so I have been involved

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,969
in that too but I am basically still a

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,800
developer so I write code I do all the

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,039
backend front-end and all those kind of

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,590
stuff that most of us do but this talk

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,539
is not about code this talk is about you

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,629
about all the open-source contributors

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,780
open-source maintainer anyone who has to

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,620
do anything with open-source basically

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:03,409
so I guess by the fourth day of AUSA you

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,670
people are already all convinced that

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,350
everyone needs to do open-source

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,900
everything needs to be open-source and

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,090
that's the best way to go about it but

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,939
then there are still some few people who

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,920
might still have maybe some statistical

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,920
data so I'll show you some statistical

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,590
data this is 96 plus million active

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,869
github repositories but as we heard in

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,700
the indeed talk there are like 50

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,759
percent are the open source activities

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,220
which happen outside github so there are

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:38,610
a lot of open source projects you can

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,189
say 78% companies run on open source so

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,290
it's like the company might not be an

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,000
open source based project or whatever it

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,130
is it might be a closed source company

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,869
but definitely they're using some kind

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,640
of open source other if not anything

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,549
there surely running a Linux server or

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,009
something like that so 78% companies run

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,540
on open source 92% applications contain

00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,670
some kind of open source libraries so

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,340
most probably any website even if it's a

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,180
closed source company whether it be grab

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,430
or anything

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,710
they are probably using some kind of

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,229
open source library right like if not

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,360
anything JavaScript jQuery Python Ruby

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,460
almost all of them are open source

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,080
so as you can understand that most of

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,060
the people whether it be open source

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,400
project or not somehow use open source

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,740
anyways right so open source does have

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,290
an impact on everyone's life so if you

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,700
know if you know about open source you

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,500
don't know about open source you are

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:35,620
definitely using open source so that's

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,870
all but then some money talks so 387

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,790
billion dollars of economic value

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,200
provided by open source though this is a

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:46,000
statistic like black duck software so

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,400
open source itself provide like

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,370
producers for 387 billion of economic

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,910
values all over the world right so that

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,890
says a lot though we say free free free

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,630
all the time but there's a lot of money

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,940
involved right but what motivates most

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,830
of us to do open source right like many

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,840
of us are saying that everyone should be

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,560
doing open source open source open all

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,790
the time but there are two parts of

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,980
motivation intrinsic motivation and

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,260
extrinsic motivation intrinsic

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,030
motivations like personal hobby many of

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,250
us just do open source as a hobby

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,470
project while working in a closest

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,299
company many of us do just for the

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,799
enjoyment of learning because with open

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:28,660
source comes a lot of learning you can

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,100
learn from different parts of the world

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,510
without even have to go into the

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,540
physical place on yourself

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,700
right fun and culture because like the

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,220
community there are everything the

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,200
people around open-source it's all fun

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,260
it's all about the culture of the open

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,910
source right extrinsic so what are the

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,250
extrinsic motivation peer to peer

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,769
recognitions like many other open source

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,260
people who are like really valued in the

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,910
community they come to recognize you so

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,340
that's one of the extrinsic motivations

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,140
Carriere advancement so obviously being

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,510
part of open source conferences being

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,640
part of many open source projects often

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,799
helps you to get a better carrier right

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,650
we have seen this happening again and

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,140
again self marketing right and financial

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,660
rewards so I'm gonna talk about more

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,660
about the financial rewards because we

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:20,200
have seen that that's a problem still

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,060
there in open source so 62% of the open

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,550
source projects are still self funded

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,100
what do I mean by self funded when I say

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,880
self funded means that this project

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,040
basically have no source of money coming

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,770
from anywhere else it's just a

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,770
maintainer who had maybe started off it

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,380
as a hobby project and now they're

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,750
developing on it and yeah it's mostly

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,700
the pocket comes out of their money or a

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,500
few group of people's money so 62

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:52,000
percent of open source projects are

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:55,690
basically self-funded so that's a little

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,640
bit kind of a problem so the problem I'm

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,010
going to talk about is sustainability

00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,260
so is open so sustainable so there are

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,810
different ways that people who are doing

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,520
open source go about sustaining

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,110
themselves some of them have patreon

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,730
accounts so so that kind of solves a

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,650
little bit but it's not very focused

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,240
right for a patron accounts there are

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,610
youtubers who also have a patreon

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,310
accounts they're video of loggers who

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,190
have a patreon account so they the open

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,620
source developers are not like really

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,140
the main use case of patreon so as to

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,150
say right so and there are many

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,610
different other ways of sustaining but

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,760
not always works out and if you are not

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:40,660
convinced that maybe he's saying just

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,940
jargons and it's sustainable so anyone

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,810
who used semantic UI over here front-end

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:51,040
developers okay so see anyone who has

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,460
used bootstrap okay if you have used

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,740
bootstrap semantically is according to

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,690
me it's a better version of bootstrap

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,140
because it doesn't make your website

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,930
look like Twitter but yeah so this is

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,150
the author of semantic UI so there was

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,490
this issue in semantic UI about a

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,590
semantic UI development dead and as you

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,780
can see it has a lot of stars so many

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,690
people do use semantic UI it's not like

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,820
just yet another project and no one

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,670
practically uses it but it's got a

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,150
pretty decent number of users and this

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,190
is what the reply was to that issue

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,110
basically what it says is he has been

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,510
spending quite some time in semantic UI

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,730
but it's not a sustainable way of living

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,310
and he also has to leave here so sustain

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,350
himself so according to that he feels

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,360
that it's not financially stable for him

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,750
to contribute to this project and that's

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,360
why he has been like inactive in the

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,729
semantic UI development here's another

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,139
example anyone know about this incident

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:55,930
event stream so this happened like in

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,090
the end of last year and anyone who is a

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,879
JavaScript developer probably should be

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,879
knowing about this incident so this even

00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,370
stream incident actually kind of wrecked

00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,099
almost all the projects in the npm right

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,900
so what happened is basically this guy

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:13,029
who was maintaining event stream right

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,770
so he also failed the same problem he

00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:16,900
failed that even stream is basically not

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,879
sustainable for him he has to do other

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,620
stuff so I can sustain him so so he

00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,779
became pretty inactive in event stream

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,419
and then there came another contributor

00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,219
and he is like hey so I would like to

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,560
maintain event stream and he's like why

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,270
not sure because I'm not anyways doing

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,250
it it's not a sustainable way of doing

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,139
so anyone who says that they want to

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,969
maintain it I am pretty okay with it

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:41,439
so he gives him the access and what

00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:44,279
happens is like day or two after people

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,860
discovered that even stream has some

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,529
malicious code in it and almost all the

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:55,330
NPM packages which used an event stream

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:57,039
which is a lot kind of breaks so you by

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:02,199
seeing the reactions I guess you can

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,330
understand what happened yeah this is

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,469
another trade that came out so anyone

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:10,120
who has heard about es lint if you're a

00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,129
JavaScript developer and you haven't

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,550
heard about any linting tool it's really

00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,979
sad but okay so this is basically

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,810
another example where he says like yeah

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,580
he does yes lint which is used by

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,949
practically anyone who uses JavaScript

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,069
right because javascript as we know is a

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,409
great language but until and unless you

00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:32,289
write it in a good way it's not really

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,360
great in a programmatic way so yes lint

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,820
really helps in that keeping all the

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,130
linting stuffs good like keeping the

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,099
code clean so almost everyone who writes

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,690
JavaScript uses yes lint right but his

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,529
mom is like how much do you earn from it

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,199
and he is like nothing so yeah here's

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,810
another example Babel J's anyone who has

00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,560
heard about Babel jizz so if you are a

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,820
most great

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,670
developer I guess you have heard about

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:02,110
babble tears because yeah again all

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,610
those JavaScript jargons but so this is

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,710
very practical example right if

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,270
Microsoft says you if you're using a

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,940
service of Microsoft like the normal

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,589
users not like the open SUSE enthusiast

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,350
maybe but if you're using a Microsoft

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:16,240
server whatever be the case and they ask

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,520
you for some money because of the

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,350
service you are like ok but if someone

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,300
says C Babel J's you're practically

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,029
using it every day would you like to

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,750
donate to us why should i because I am

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:30,640
getting it for free so yeah there is a

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,140
problem in the sustainability in

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,029
open-source as I guess it's irrelevant

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,790
so this is kind of the life of a

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,350
maintainer in many cases like most of

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,640
the open-source projects I am NOT

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,110
talking about the big open source

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,450
projects but many of the open source

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,550
projects like es Lane Babel J semantic

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,230
UI they basically have just one or two

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,520
maintained as we were walking and they

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,980
also are not working in the project

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,170
entire time so working in this project

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,600
is not really sustainable for them right

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,280
so this is how most of the life as a

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,410
maintainer goes like it's about learning

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,060
they learn how to make the project

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,310
better do all the stuffs that they can

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,320
create value by the project so that

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,800
other people can like use this project

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,140
and then comes what happens is they the

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,300
cost that they're giving into the

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,710
project is basically time right more

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,170
than the money it's the time and they

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,180
are not getting much out of it so many

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,780
of the time what happens is it leads to

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,660
burnout so this is kind of the design

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,180
space that I envy and get kind of

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,610
walking in so it's like the blocks in an

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,920
open-source place so when I put blocks

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,770
in and open source together and put a

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,010
plus I know many people might get offand

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,440
it in the open-source community but I'm

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:48,880
going to try a little to convince you

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,410
so in blocking the most of the things in

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,990
blockchain are still open source right

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,630
and we are still trying to make most of

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,750
the things open source there are some

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,029
things which are closed source and it's

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,650
not really good as we heard like smart

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,980
contracts should also be open source

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,490
right so those kind of things the good

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,980
thing about blockchain is

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,350
I would say it kind of helps I see

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,200
blocked in personally as a another

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,850
technical stat though most people see it

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,339
as the cryptocurrency so anyone who

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,990
hears blocked and kind of here's Bitcoin

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:22,760
in the back of their mind but I'm going

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,740
to talk about it as a technical stack

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,320
right it's just another technical stack

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,089
just like writing in PI tandra lighting

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,120
and react writing in any other language

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,770
right so it's a technical stack which

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,440
kind of provides you with financial

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,410
services on every programmatic

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,600
transaction right and it's in a way done

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,700
with open source right so what happens

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,640
is any money produced by blocks and can

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,470
kind of be associated again back to open

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,690
source and that's why you can

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,330
practically fund open source projects

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,640
using blockchain and apart from that

00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,490
also blockchain helps in the all the

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,959
staking part of the things so many of

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,420
you who have worked as a freelance

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,220
developer you know like stake holding is

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,720
one of the important parts because you

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,690
never know whether it will be paid at

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,089
the end of the day so you can always use

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:16,400
smart contract as an application for

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:19,339
that right so the problem as we can see

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,839
is on two sides right why is there only

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,910
one maintainer why's there no

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,890
contributor to the project the reason is

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,620
the contributors don't get anything out

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,750
of it yes many people walk only for the

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,880
swags for the t-shirts for the stickers

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,459
but that doesn't really last long right

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,140
so that's why there might be many

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,839
projects which doesn't really get a lot

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,089
of contributors until and unless they

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,180
have like real belief and faith in the

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,010
project and so us but and at the same

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,320
time the repo maintenance they can't

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,000
really prioritize on issues like most of

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,350
the work if the it's a priority they

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,579
have to walk on it themselves because

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,890
they don't really have a lot of

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,690
contributors to work on or they can't

00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,920
really rely on getting a contributor

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,720
whenever they need it right so that's

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,399
the problem that we are kind of trying

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,050
to solve and get current trying to make

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,149
open so sustainable for both the

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,130
contributors and the maintainer so this

00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,410
is kind of the flow right so the funder

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,829
whether the funder has some funding from

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,650
consensus or aetherium foundation or he

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,850
has his own large amount of blocks and

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,230
aetherium lie

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,940
in his somewhere and he needs developers

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,139
right so everyone needs the developers

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,850
of what they can do is they can

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,279
basically just come to a platform and

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,589
fund an issue and what the contributor

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,509
would do in this case is go to the issue

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,699
they would contribute to the project and

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,680
they get whatever the funding was so

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,720
whatever the funding they get the

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,370
contributor has this motivation the

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,560
extrinsic motivation that we were

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,509
talking about the financial rewards so

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,980
the contributor can basically get those

00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:51,889
financial reverts and the extrinsic

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,660
motivation like makes them to continue

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,850
with their contributions again and again

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,380
but with the funder what they can do is

00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,509
they can basically prioritize on the

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,399
issues so even if they can't depend on

00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,430
one single contributor they know that we

00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,620
can put a bounty in this our platform

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,690
and then some what your the open source

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,600
contributor if they have the skills to

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:15,860
do this will pick this up

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:19,730
so that's kind of the flow so and the

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,529
idea is to make jobs or work something

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,980
like this left side of the image a

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:27,259
mesh-like architecture not really even

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,120
though most of the startups would say

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,880
that we have a flat hierarchy but it

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,310
still kind of ends up being some

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,980
hierarchy but a mesh-like network would

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,630
kind of enable like maybe the founder of

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,370
this project can also be contributing to

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,720
another project and another projects

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,730
founder contributes back to another

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,920
project so it's an entire measure rather

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,040
than a very hierarchy tree like

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,910
structure right so that's kind of the

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,459
aim that we are trying for so to

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,000
convince that get kind kind of work so

00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:02,600
we started off in November 2017 and are

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,819
the data visible out the back okay so

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,509
the total platform value we already have

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:11,449
is 900 K dollar ish it's more than that

00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:14,209
right now and we have like 300 plus

00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:16,639
funder 17,000 plus developers so as you

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,829
can see the idea is something like uber

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,100
or grab right where you can basically be

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:24,230
like you put a job and some you know

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,389
that someone will actually take it up

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,370
and at the same time the contributors

00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,589
can go there and always hope to find a

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,689
job line for them so that's way it's

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,440
like converting the open source model

00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,740
into it

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,120
job kind of a model where both the

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,160
maintainer and the developer can

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,180
actually have some kind of benefit out

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,710
of it so the first thing that I'm going

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,180
to talk about is the bounteous thing

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,610
that we have that haven't been telling

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,740
about so if you go to the Bounty space

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,530
I'll put all the links at the end of the

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,240
slide so we basically have a listing of

00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,310
all the bounties and these bounties are

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,200
basically just opens those issues right

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,570
now get kind is integrated with github

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,310
so these are practically github issues

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,290
which someone has funded come to our

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,480
platform funded it with any year say 20

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,310
tokens so get kind doesn't have any

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,560
token of ourselves like it's not a

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,930
cryptocurrency it's not a token you can

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,460
come and practically fund with any years

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,800
eternity token that you have like beat

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:22,100
etherium bid die bit light go and

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,750
whatever it is and these are all the

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,490
listings of all the bounties that have

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,190
been funded in the platform right so you

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,560
can put all the filters go to maybe

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,210
python projects or javascript project or

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,710
any kind of project it's not like every

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:38,300
project is a blocks in project even

00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:40,670
right and then you click on any of the

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,800
bounties that you're interested so if

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,710
anyone is thinking why he's not giving a

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,870
demo and showing screenshots well I

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,140
didn't do my human sacrifice to the demo

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:54,140
gods today so I'll stick to screenshots

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,450
so this is like the bounty details that

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,280
you can see so you click on a bounty you

00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,750
will see that this page appears where

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,520
basically you have a description which

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,520
is just like the github description for

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,410
the issue so there's a button which most

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,209
people use that's view and github right

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,709
so you can just practically view and

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,650
github and it's another open source

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,480
issue right there after you've clicked

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,220
on so if you see there's a start work

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,530
button so if you click on the start work

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,770
button and start walking on a particular

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,110
issue

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,750
it's practically still the open source

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,579
flow that you do like which all of you

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,220
who are contributors are familiar with

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,650
right so you would go you would actually

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,140
go to the channel that they do all the

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,150
conversations you would submit a pull

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,640
request you would then like have a

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,280
review go to and fro about the review

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,440
and all those things right so it already

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,179
has all the benefits of open source we

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,820
are not like getting in the path of

00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,559
those things it's so ever

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,360
everything comes into that after you

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,279
have started working it still the open

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,130
source flow once you have completed your

00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,620
walk your pull request is submitted and

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,149
merged and reviewed and everything so

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,899
basically you come back to this page

00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:04,250
which will have a submit work option so

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,840
after you have clicked on start work

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,230
this start work button basically changes

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,909
to submit work and you can click on the

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,289
submit work you put the politicus which

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:13,669
has been merged related to the

00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,799
particular bounty that you were walking

00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:18,320
on and then the funder comes and pays

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,929
you right so that's basically the flow

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,289
that's it and you get whatever the

00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:26,090
funding amount was right so that's

00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:27,980
basically the get kind bounties that I

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,720
have been talking about then there is

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,779
something called could fund have anyone

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,970
of you heard about code fun so if anyone

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,950
has gone to sustain OSS I guess you

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,470
might have heard about code fun by Eric

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,690
Berry so code fund is kind of an article

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,090
advertisement

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,789
it's helps it's an open a platform that

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,830
funds contributors to like of the open

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:52,039
source ecosystem to put their jobs out

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,809
there then there is something called get

00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,720
current grants this is something that we

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:59,450
nearly started in around like November

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,090
December of 2018 and get current grants

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,360
it's kind of in the model of pitching

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,279
but then it's particularly meant for the

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,259
maintainer of an open source project so

00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,960
what you can do is basically if you have

00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:13,580
an open source project with a team so

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,590
you can come to a platform you can

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,539
create a get current grants and you can

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,679
say ok this is the amount of grants that

00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,990
I'm expecting and it's a

00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,179
subscription-based model so anyone who

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,889
is into blockchains you can actually go

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,509
to the EIP one three three seven and

00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:30,789
read about the entire subscription

00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:33,529
protocol and so what happens is he gets

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,470
from the entire grant amount he will be

00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,269
getting like some money out of it every

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,700
month so it's like the subscription

00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:43,730
model and you get the money every month

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:47,750
device right so you subscribe to that

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,629
and basically anyone can go and fund

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,309
your project so like what the idea

00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:54,409
behind this is basically even the

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,840
tiniest amounts of funds will basically

00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,909
amount to a large amount of fund for

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,450
your project finally and you get the

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:03,880
money out of

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,710
and we are doing something called CLR

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,929
matching right now so what happens in

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,970
CLR matching is whatever the amount you

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,010
fund to a particular project we will be

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,080
matching that amount for you so this

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,529
leads to a graph something like this so

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,230
if you fund someone funds to $75 firstly

00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:22,330
we will fund to $75 which leads to 550

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,419
dollars then if someone have green funds

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,789
to $75 it actually amounts to a $25.00

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,890
and as you can see it gets up higher and

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,600
higher right so this is something that

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,669
we are doing it's currently in progress

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,640
still if I'm not wrong

00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:38,710
April 19 so anyone who wants you can go

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,140
to the get-go and grant speech I have

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,880
the link at the end and you can see that

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,950
if you feel like an open-source project

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,299
that you want to fund for you can do

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,270
that and we will be doing a sailor

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:51,760
matching to that this is something very

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,799
recent so this is like the inflation

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,470
funding this is not yet implemented it's

00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:58,210
in a proposal state so AIP one seven

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,440
eight nine anyone can go and read about

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:06,240
it so disclosure I am NOT the author is

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,429
my CEO is the author but yeah and

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,070
inflation funding so what anyone has any

00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,190
idea about inflation funding in

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,740
blockchains

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,649
anyone has heard about it so inflation

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,100
funding is the term that's like been

00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:23,230
there for a month or so I guess or a

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,590
little more than that in the blockchain

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,260
ecosystem where to say like say

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:31,539
inflation funding is kind of like the

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,210
mining itself the walk itself should pay

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:36,909
you like you don't have to someone else

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,799
doesn't have to pay you the transaction

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,140
or the mining itself would pay you so

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,220
that way it's kind of a reward for doing

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:47,169
the mining for yourself or whatever so

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,270
10% increase in the block reverts so it

00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,039
would be like it could fund up to a

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,640
hundred million dollars so as you see

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,549
right so that's something that's very

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,580
new you can all read about it and I

00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:02,100
would really like to know about your

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,570
like what do you feel about this thing

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,679
because we are really excited about this

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,630
and that brings me to the end of my talk

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,550
so these are all the reference links so

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,870
the good kind that Co Explorer will take

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,330
you do all the bounties that are listed

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,910
over there the how contributor and on

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:21,100
what contributor basically goes like

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:24,130
takes you through all the steps that you

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,680
need to become a contributor get kinda

00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,450
grants has all the grants pages like all

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,520
the grants listed you can also go and

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,350
create your own grants and the last link

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:48,310
is basically the inflation funding EIP

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:50,320
link so that's all any questions okay so

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,360
