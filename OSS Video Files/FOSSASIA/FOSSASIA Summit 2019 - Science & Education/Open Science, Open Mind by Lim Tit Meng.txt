As scientific endeavours require an open mind, science is to be shared openly.  The mission of a science centre is about science communication with the purpose of opening the mind of people with evidence based information. Scientific information, discoveries, and inventions should be treated as an open source to benefit as many people and sectors as possible. In my sharing, I will give a general reflection on how SCS started supporting FOSSASIA and the event has grown over the years to not just open minds but also open eyes for people to see possibilities otherwise untapped if the initiative was only for a closed community.
