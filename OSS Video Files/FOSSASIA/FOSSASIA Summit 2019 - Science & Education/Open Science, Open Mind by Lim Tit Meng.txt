Title: Open Science, Open Mind by Lim Tit Meng
Publication date: 2019-03-31

Description: 
	15 March 2019 10:25, Lecture Theatre

As scientific endeavours require an open mind, science is to be shared openly.  The mission of a science centre is about science communication with the purpose of opening the mind of people with evidence based information. Scientific information, discoveries, and inventions should be treated as an open source to benefit as many people and sectors as possible. In my sharing, I will give a general reflection on how SCS started supporting FOSSASIA and the event has grown over the years to not just open minds but also open eyes for people to see possibilities otherwise untapped if the initiative was only for a closed community.

I'd like to welcome on stage kit Ming

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,919
the CEO of the science center of

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,500
Singapore very important member of this

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,750
science community and so as CEO of the

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,740
science center and vice dean of NUS tip

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,770
Ming Limited Meng promotes stem as an

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,210
engine for knowledge-based innovation

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,859
engages with stakeholders to share the

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,960
mission and champion the creative

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,849
science communications so his goal is to

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,410
inspire the youth and to see stem as a

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,210
powerful means to create their own

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,170
future so science is to be shared openly

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,670
the mission of the Science Center is

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,710
about science communication with the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,610
permanent purpose of opening the minds

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,710
with evidence-based information tip Ming

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,629
will give a reflection on how CSC

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,489
started supporting Foss Asia and brought

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,059
benefits to this community

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,350
okay well I think thank you for the

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:54,809
introduction I stood up because I won't

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,199
even cut I know your tea break is coming

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,500
up and it's okay I will keep your tea

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,989
break because I haven't got any slides

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,840
okay in fact when I was sitting there I

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,760
was just roaming through my mind how can

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,159
I condense what I'm gonna say so that

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,650
one into your tea break well first of

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,350
all I have to thank Mario and hopeful

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:21,509
for inviting me especially on your 10th

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,340
anniversary of force Asia right and I

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,350
came here to first of all to

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,900
congratulate and also to consider that

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,520
congratulate a team for putting in this

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,369
effort sharing the same conviction and

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,939
commitment to come into this year after

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,470
year and if you saw all the slides

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,869
earlier you must have come across

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,460
Science Center Arena was 25 26 27 that

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:47,040
force Asia was hosted at a science

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,939
center now when I was first introduced I

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,040
was impressed first of all by the

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,700
motivation behind and also it was a

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,170
timely thing because the whole idea of

00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,880
distressed transformation although it

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,299
was not used yet at that point in time

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,700
in 2015 Singapore nice Charles is really

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,209
engaged during all the public service

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,430
division to move on to digitalization

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,810
digital transformation and so forth so

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,880
in a way science center

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,610
should be always looking forward to the

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,500
horizon what could be and then I also

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,170
realized that this force Asia is

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,440
actually a network of experts network of

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,209
people some people really very formal

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,190
some people put on hats all the time and

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,050
some people come in in a real crazy

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,640
crazy fashion and some people come in

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,709
they talk about technology which was

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:42,730
beyond many of us but we all know that

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:46,299
the technology will be transformational

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,510
in terms of how impact on our world and

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:52,030
Science Center is very happy was very

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,720
happy and is still happy to be part of

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,890
this movement and I was just looking at

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,319
the fos s right and I'm a scientist and

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,930
and science in the Science Center is to

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,670
be shared openly and that's why when I

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,580
was taught as an open source kind of

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,049
thing I say it fit our ethos that's the

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,090
whole purpose of Science Center we want

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,700
to open up sign to as many people as

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,319
possible to open their minds just to let

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,870
them see the impact of science and how

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,840
without science probably there would be

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,380
technology I mean you can argue with me

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,810
later

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,660
whether you agree on that to me science

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,130
is the foundation for what we call

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,410
knowledge-based economies because of

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,510
science understand sign understand

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,230
scientific phenomena and from there we

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,480
drive application and technology okay I

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,160
mean that doesn't my veal ok as a

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,910
science senator I must put science in

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,790
front first and and and when when you

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,680
get science in the past signs are in a

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,859
way locked up in their ivory towers and

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,870
is only for the learn it okay for the

00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,280
learn it and and sometimes the

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,290
scientists may look down on people who

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,269
don't understand science idiot you're

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,060
illiterate you don't understand I'm

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,160
talking about and scientists like to

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,920
publish papers in journals that only

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,389
their peers understand your editorial

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,370
biomedical of paper you will say how

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,900
what's all about it's not the concern

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,900
for them to communicate openly he's more

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,180
showing off how much I know that that

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,489
you do not know and a peer review is

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,289
just is two up one another okay and in

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,210
competition our purposes suppress our

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,010
paper because I know I'm going to do a

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,560
pictu before you publish

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,050
all these other so-called not open but

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:36,030
close competition and and and and and

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:39,730
now with with the explosion of a

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:44,080
platform to share information freely in

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,840
all kinds of social network internet and

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,750
the famous doctor Google or mr. Google

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,500
it's important that science is now

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,390
really open as truthful as possible and

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,930
also as transparent as possible

00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,020
otherwise if science is only manipulator

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,130
and monopolized by so-called experts

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,010
science is not doing what science should

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,110
be it's to benefit the whole of mankind

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,150
and and we are talking about sustainable

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,550
development goals we talk about climate

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,320
change reverse science as evidence-based

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,090
and and it's very positive this openness

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,940
otherwise you can get pseudoscience you

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,100
get fake news you can even use science

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,870
as a political tool to twist and turn

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,460
things around so therefore I was

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,730
impressed with this openness and

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:34,750
therefore when I was asked whether we

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,770
could host I said yes I mean one thing

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,960
good Bob Iger co III I just make a

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,090
decision and because I did tell the

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,590
Minister for Education long time ago and

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,140
invited me to take on this role and

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,270
borrowed from a university ok I didn't

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,060
ask for this job so I actually asked

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,590
this question where is my boundary they

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,940
they couldn't tell me and I say I just

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,830
push the boundary on t they slap me it

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,480
was clever few times and this is

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,810
something that I think I almost got

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,520
slapped because what's this you know

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,760
especially we bring in international

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,410
people coming in anyway we are very

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,170
through three years very exciting three

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,320
years and in the three years we have joy

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,770
and agony because Science Center is not

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,390
really a conducive place for for this

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,670
kind of gathering because we have our

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,760
public's gallery and so and so forth I

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,220
was a good experiment and then later we

00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,120
have to discuss with Hong fook and

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,890
and Maria how can we sustain this and

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,800
that's when our good friends live on the

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:38,440
solution came in because soon after that

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,300
we started to work closely with Li and

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,550
Li all started to come in to do the

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,720
scene for education to to really educate

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,910
our public about the future work skills

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,130
future and so and so forth and and and

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,460
literacy in terms of coding in terms of

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:58,060
tech is very important so we became the

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,730
matchmaker and there's a second time we

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,890
are running in ll I and and and this

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:08,530
brings me to the next part that is the

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:10,870
what f3 I don't know how you think that

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,910
what free you take a work-free for

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,340
granted and we all know there whatever

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,340
organization of events and so and so

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,250
forth nothing is free somebody gotta pay

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,020
for something ok and and at a science

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,010
center we always believe in doing good

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,290
and doing well my staff always

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,630
complained to me while talking about we

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,740
have to bring in revenue and fear a

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,390
government agency karma should fund us

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,500
but I told them you know that government

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,230
would not fun you forever and ever and

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,780
government expect you to be standing on

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,600
your own feet somehow ok you wouldn't be

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,240
a hundred percent funding and and

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,070
therefore I told our people that in some

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,210
things that we do we can go free but

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,810
instead of these we need to recover

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,360
cause otherwise how can we grow so I'm

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,040
going pressed by the business model so

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,340
I'm learning I'm trying to learn how for

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,610
Asia I look at the rescission fee is

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,900
actually very very cheap right to come

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,760
in and get a ticket and so and so forth

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,140
so it is an interesting model and also

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,120
it showed its back to you when you say

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,350
fee what does it mean something could

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,210
repay for when you something gotta pay

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,600
for the food somebody got to pay for

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:22,210
something so how free is free okay so

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,450
this balancing do good and do well is

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,520
something that we as as a learning

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,710
institution as a science center that's a

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,919
mission driven institution does not for

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,849
profit we also try to learn what you

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,880
mean by free

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:39,840
ok so I really want to learn from you

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,570
you have something interesting to share

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,270
me of you very happy to really what I

say I call you Sifu okay call you the

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,550
master teach me how to do free at the

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,960
same time do good do well and it is this

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,180
something that organization is

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,080
struggling and and and finally they also

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,510
want to open to all expert here because

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
one good thing about being involved in

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,810
the force Asia we also understand how

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,850
you can use technology to to do

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,180
hackathon and also use technology to do

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,570
special offerings and and and work

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,610
processes and engagement in a science

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,220
center so last year we hosted a

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,590
hackathon to ask our people can you

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,030
cover solutions look at Science Center

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:27,180
in 2013 and you can if you come in with

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,040
the solutions you are also embarking on

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,500
a worldwide journey because the whole

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,740
world is asking the Zen Center is a

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,270
center still relevant we try to go to

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,070
the Science Center to see a certain

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,540
science demonstration this is not

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,850
YouTube can tell you everything

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,370
ok and informations are now fully

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,530
available you in the past sign centers

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,990
are so-called authority of scientific

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,850
facts and and and and know-how but now

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,230
the vistas coming in to the center

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,410
probably know more than you do

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:59,000
so how do we reinvent a Science Center

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:02,550
what is Science Center version 2.0 and

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,320
also from Singapore's perspective in

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,060
line with a digital transformation we

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,090
are looking at how to use smart

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,420
technology to make seamless journey

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,280
before the visitors comes in during the

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,350
journey in the Science Center and after

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,630
leaving a Science Center what our

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,090
engagement work our platform work our

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,120
learning tool and so and so forth so in

00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,470
the hackathon we have interesting

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,990
students who came up with projects and

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,150
we go to embark on a journey with them

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,280
to see how it could help science center

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,240
transform some of them could be free so

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,530
let me turn out to be something very

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,170
interesting there you can see I guess

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:40,710
consultant to do to to move towards

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,630
other Science Center so I I want to open

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,390
the invite freely open invite to you

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,720
that if you think that science that deep

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,870
help force Asia grow in Singapore and

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
your give back to the Science Center and

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,290
indirectly giving back to lavon's links

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,180
to

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,320
because we tap on them to do events with

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,579
them okay you know where to contact me

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,670
if you do not know well contact me

00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:05,230
follow from fo and Mario they are very

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,889
good in making the initial contact and

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,470
then how by the communication and

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,449
conversation we struck off I think it's

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,300
remarkable that over the past years we

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,800
have grown to a good understanding

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,139
there's mutual trust and respect and

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,810
also very openly telling them the agony

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:28,000
we had on the word free

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:30,459
warum by free okay so I taught up to you

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,660
and and maybe later if you have some

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,360
answers or going to share with me your

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,130
perspective your fee I'll be what I call

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,199

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,600
under Janis proverbs I wash my ears to

00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:43,000
listen to you because I really want to

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,740
learn from you so with that I want to

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,589
just end off by saying once again

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,110
congratulations and open science open

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:53,110

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,839
because they opened my mind to what the

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,510
tech world is and we began to see a lot

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,970
of possibilities otherwise I'm Ted thank
