Title: Opportunities for Data and Privacy Protection in the Overlooked Region - Ploy Chanprasert
Publication date: 2019-10-20
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Cloud, Container, DevOps
Description: 
	Ploy Chanprasert

The session has an objective to explore possibilities of having a personal data
monitoring tool is free, easy to use, and open source for general public in Southeast Asia where efforts on cybersecurity and personal data and privacy protection are still limited. Many data breach incidents have not been handled properly looking at it from human rights perspectives. There are times that affected individuals are told to changed their passwords only without knowing where their personal data goes compared to those in
the first world countries where personal data monitoring service is offered. The tool, if there is a possibility to develop, would help protect people in data breach incidents in Southeast Asia. The session aims to discuss the possibility to develop this tool from  technical perspectives.

	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,069
I'm going to talk about a personal data

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,300
monitoring service in the case of data

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,920
breach in Southeast Asia so since the

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,809
beginning of this year

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:19,920
well actually I would like to give you a

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,590
brief background about this a bit so

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,619
this is not going to be like a very tech

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,650
tech session but looking at the

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,699
relationship between the technology and

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:34,320
human right and personal data protection

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,570
which is a topic that gained attention

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,260
very much in Thailand at the moment

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,719
because the introduction of the GDP are

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,270
the law on the personal data protections

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,559
in the European Union that was

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:54,480
introduced at a few years ago so since

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,239
the beginning of 2019 there are actually

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,129
two major data breach in that happened

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,149
at the original level of Southeast Asia

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:07,710
so the first one that I'm going to talk

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:11,280
about today is the case of Sephora which

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:15,240
is a cosmetic retailer that I hope that

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,369
you know it's about them so give you the

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,900
background a bit so the Sephora data

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,090
breach involve around 3 million

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,369
individual personal data that have an

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,100
online account with Sephora so don't

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,640
mean if you ever purchased like cosmetic

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,070
skincare online sort of mean you are one

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,990
of those three millions and if a

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,840
customer in a country in Asia and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,280
Pacific so five five country in

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,009
Southeast Asia Thailand Indonesia

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,680
Malaysia Philippines Singapore and three

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,229
country outside of origin which is Hong

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,299
Kong New Zealand and Australia so what

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,110
happened after the data breach happened

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,729
was that Sephora offered the personal

00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:00,810
data monitoring service to only four

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,570
countries that are affected which is

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:09,360
Singapore Hong Kong New Zealand and

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,899
Australia you can as I said is you might

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,720
notice that

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:18,510
it's kind of a discrimination because

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:21,819
the incident happened the same the

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,840
people that are affected belong in the

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,940
same data bridge

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,610
we saw belong to the same database

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,690
things like that so the personal data

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:35,140
monitoring service that Sephora offered

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,720
to the customer was that it's claimed to

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,950
be okay I'm gonna show you this first so

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,930
this is from the Australian surfer our

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,549
website how do I sign up for the

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:51,280
personal data monitoring service so you

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:54,489
can click on this link at that time and

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,400
then they give you the password the code

00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,920
to use this kind of service which is for

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,810
you to scan whether where your leak

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,569
that'll go even in the dark web

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,900
according to the claim but this is a

00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:09,280
separate Island is where are you

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,560
offering me a free personal data

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,450
monitoring service at the same time has

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,400
happened so it said that local

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,250
regulatory requirement prohibit the

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,299
service from being offered in your

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:28,660
market so that's why we think that this

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:30,370
is like a form of discrimination so as I

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,919
said before as I mentioned a little bit

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,780
earlier about this so the personal data

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:39,299
monitoring free service it was offered

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:43,769
by sufferer partner called Experian so

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:48,430
as we saw in the previous slide the

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:50,440
reason that the company gave to to those

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,209
that do not get the service is because

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,349
of the local law that doesn't allow it

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,419
to happen but actually Experian only

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,569
operate mainly in those personal country

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:05,590
only so those four countries only that

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,540
were that get those kind of service so

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,199
they do not provide any kind of service

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:16,049
in the country in in any country in

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:21,320
Southeast Asia except Singapore so um I

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:23,480
actually wonder whether is it

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,180
personal data monitoring service that

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,500
Sephora offer might be beneficial in

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:35,450
terms of we know where other leaked data

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,880
go and but Experian actually if you

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,680
answer in a row data if you are general

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,290
customer you have to pay a very high fee

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,270
in order to use that service so the

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,800
outside that offer leaked personal data

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,020
tracking like that for free according to

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,390
the package actually but at some extent

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,460
you can use that service for free so

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,580
there are have I been poned have I been

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,210
so and be harsh so this these three

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,850
three sighs it's like it's offer you

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,770
it's like this so you can like enter

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,830
email address or password

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,910
and you can see like okay where your

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,400
where your email address or the password

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,960
that you use for that email address went

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,130
to things like that

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:30,710
so what happened with this websites are

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:34,850
that usually they have database leak

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:40,490
that the best store in in in their own

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:44,120
database and usually database Western

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,430
bait so usually they do not have the

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,330
leak database that occur in Southeast

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,660
Asia region or in countries in at a

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,860
national level like when we realize that

00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:00,530
through move has a data breach case last

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,240
year in 2018 right so decide they don't

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:06,710
have anything like that because they

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:12,440
don't have like the data bridge that the

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:16,820
data the data base that belong to this

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:20,480
this our region store on and on the

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,790
database except when it's at the global

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,440
scale like Tumbo or things like that so

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:30,050
this is a you can see this company do

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,329
not belong to like Thailand or any

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,839
country in south

00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:42,169
so this is the database that have I been

00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:43,939
pawn store when the data breach happened

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,229
companies that experience another

00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:48,319
in Southeast Asia are not held

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,909
accountable the recent cases lie on air

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:58,729
where it's three subsidiary like malindo

00:06:51,909 --> 00:07:03,079
thailand air and also but with

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:06,199
Indonesian Air Base it's only Melinda

00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:09,949
that issue a statement because they have

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:13,939
they fly to Europe countries so that's

00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:16,819
why they kind of enforced they kind of

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,129
info on a statement and to show some

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:23,289
responsibility according to the GDP are

00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:28,549
because they have to comply with the law

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:30,469
so actually I wonder whether the

00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:33,819
personal data monitoring service is a

00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:36,379
tool that is actually useful because we

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:39,709
they actually have been some criticism

00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,419
about this service first how the code of

00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,789
the leak database that store in this

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,749
website for example if the hacker want

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:49,329
to hack this database if it's not

00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,189
securely now of course it can happen

00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:55,159
sometimes the service is not free which

00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:57,049
create discrimination for example if

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,129
you're not will up in terms of like

00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:03,349
financial resources things like that so

00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:06,199
yeah that can also create this

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,789
combination why is it like all for this

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,269
website who stole millions of leaked

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:13,309
database so that's also another question

00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:16,099
also individual usually cannot do much

00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:18,979
after they find out the information for

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,739
example we are often told in the case of

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,899
data breach that we have to change our

00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:27,199
password but usually the effect is

00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:31,189
long-term as beyond the individual

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,829
capacity applet happen so here this is

00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:36,469
from the house so as I saw so Sephora

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,539
so you see like in the red circle how

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,230
can I protect myself or remove my data

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,690
so

00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,669
actually they just said that you can

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,200
contact them and they will remove your

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,000
information from that other base only

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:55,400
but ma in the public platform where the

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,260
delete information up here so as I said

00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,940
before usually when it happened

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,580
it's beyond the effect individual

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,440
capacity changing password changing your

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,080
password it's not like a complete

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:12,410
comprehensive solution to handle the

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:14,270
bridge so in the case where the bridge

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,890
happened

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,520
the company should be held responsible

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:23,510
in term up they need to console the

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,030
cyber security company in terms of the

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,360
removal of the leaked data that go

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:33,830
across the website including the dark

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:38,060
web as well investigate the incident to

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:42,440
know the cause and how and after they

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,890
learn the flaw in that database what can

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,970
they do

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,200
in terms of two people the same incident

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,070
to happen again in the future

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,780
and also in the law aspect there's also

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,550
in need of a strict law at the same

00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,650
level as the general data protection

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,080
regulation to take place to hold this

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,170
company responsible in terms of Thailand

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:08,780
I know that the Personal Data Protection

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:10,370
Act just has been adopted in May this

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,080
year but it will come into full effect

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:17,330
when year after this which is May next

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,160
year but let's do a lot of legal

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,460
loopholes in terms of that and I just

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,650
thought whether these data protections

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:31,670
Act whether it's going to work if the

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:35,990
incident like this happen so actually I

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:39,190
think that in terms of human security in

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:46,010
this region there should be like

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:48,790
unifying data protection at that country

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,790
in Southeast Asia

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:58,210
adopted the same like the same data

00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:00,430
protection act where the the the meaning

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,530
of the personal data protection where

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:08,200
the meaning of what is sensitive data is

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:11,860
interpreted the same and so it's going

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,910
to be less discrimination when this kind

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:18,100
of incident happen so the question to

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,080
discuss here if you want to discuss is

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,730
whether do you think that the personal

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,190
data monitoring service - that is

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,020
available in the market is any useful if

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,610
you're familiar with it of course and

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,500
are there any website that offer

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,660
personal data monitoring that you would

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,550
like to recommend and do you think there

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,710
is a chance to develop like a personal

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,930
data monitoring service tool that can

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,550
offer service work like search engine

00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,560
like Google where you don't have where

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:46,210
we don't have to store like you know the

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:50,640
database ah the league database in in on

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,640
the sides so any question

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:21,860
has anybody got any question yes

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,260
so my question is having such this tune

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,890
a personal data monitoring service to me

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,690
is it's a good idea but I think the big

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:49,290
question is how we can trust the company

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:55,360
any organization providing the tune

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:59,260
because if we need this tool so it's

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,110
mean we need like maybe maybe nonprofit

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,230
organization to to provide tune and then

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:09,040
how much we can trust that they can

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:14,650
store our information like simply and

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,110
privately not like say any like our

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:29,470
information to to like any any any

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:33,040
company my question is who will be the

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:37,050
owner of these data personalization

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,589
monitoring tune would be like a company

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:45,790
organization or nonprofit organization

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:47,620
does that those existing website that

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,460
has been running like have I been poned

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:54,760
or have I been sold or they have they

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,450
usually some of them are nonprofit like

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,290
have I been poned its offer your offer

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:05,050
the service for free and it's running on

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,920
like on I'm not sure whether it's a

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:12,130
nonprofit organization but the guy that

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,070
has been behind it he he doesn't accept

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,110
any money from like from the other

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,610
sources why he's doing this

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,790
I don't know whether he has like side

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,070
business or not for other side sometimes

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,900
they are a company that doing

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,060
cybersecurity not dangerous

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,800
cybersecurity in terms of like

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,080
experience for example the suffering

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,110
offer that one is the company but they

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,420
offer like their offer many services for

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,690
example like in terms of the identity

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,660
stuff

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:46,450
yeah they offer service in order to come

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:50,290
as well but the fee is very high in

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:52,180
order to use that and then I also like

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,080
the hushed it has offered you some kind

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,240
of package for example like okay if you

00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,820
want to use the Prada Soviets for free

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,400
there are these options there are these

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,770
options for you that is available and if

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,880
you pay for this certain amount you can

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:13,300
do more things like that

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:17,050
mm-hmm so it's like mix so my another

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,870
question is I think it is better to to

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,870
have like a preventive a mechanism like

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:28,180
a - because if you look at the website

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:32,070
like I have I been porn most the website

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:36,160
and happy next is government website so

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:39,790
it is better to provide the knowledge to

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,880
like to the government sector that they

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:50,350
need to provide like a CTO port O'Call

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:54,310
like HTTP rather than like having such a

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:56,910
tune to monitoring the data after we

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,910
have been happy

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:21,650
um anyone else would like to give

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,650
feedback or would like to ask questions

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,779
yes

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,030
okay during the beginning of the session

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:47,640
you mentioned that the personal monitor

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,820
link so we doesn't really have Southeast

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:55,020
Asian countries data the lesson is that

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:58,560
they are not accountable is the light so

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:08,190
the company in this region usually is

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:11,370
because so there are okay there are two

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:17,160
causes for example like in terms of

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:22,250
Sephora for country that affected except

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:26,880
Singapore in Southeast Asia they are not

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:30,680
the only the only thing that support old

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,000
them to do was to change the password

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,240
not offering the personal data

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,940
monitoring service like the rest of the

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,230
country that got affected and I think

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,900
that when they mentioned that it's

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:50,010
because of the lego matter I think that

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:57,410
it's it's the reason that is not like

00:18:50,010 --> 00:19:00,000
it's not legitimate to provide and I

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:03,660
think that they can do more in terms of

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,330
like protecting personal data or people

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,850
but I just don't know whether like

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,830
because they don't want to or because I

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:18,330
don't know and when it comes to the

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:20,130
website that exists in in the market

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,100
like have I been told already have

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:27,030
because these company are actually

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:32,880
operate like in the Western country like

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:36,090
in Europe or in the US and sometimes the

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,900
data breach happened very often happen

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:43,740
like all over the world and sometimes

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:49,050
these people they just you know don't

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:51,000
understand or do not monitor what

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,270
happened or what's going on in home of

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,660
the data breach in

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,429
is Asian country or even like well let

00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,420
alone at the national level like in

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:06,130
Thailand in terms of like to move as or

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:08,679
as I remember I think mmm lozada also

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,970
experience some kind of like data breach

00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:16,690
a few years ago groom Thai bang as well

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,700
also experience data breach like last

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:24,750
year or something like that but then

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:28,750
there's no there's not much things that

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,970
mentions about it also the media they

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,750
don't they don't talk much about the

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,640
incidents as well and I think that the

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,570
reason that the company can get away

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,360
with it is because first there's no

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:46,360
strict law that held them accountable

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,080
and also the public understanding as

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,450
well usually this kind of thing the data

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,720
breach when it happened it doesn't have

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,550
immediate effect it's like it doesn't we

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,800
don't get the immediate effect in the

00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:04,150
way that we leave our life unless or

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:06,429
until like our account has been hacked

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,440
like for example our Facebook has been

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,840
hacked because we happen to use the same

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,220
password as those account was leaked

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,710
something like that uh-huh

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,050
at that moment we realized oh okay I'm

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,210
the one that got affected what can I do

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,910
so it doesn't have like immediate effect

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,620
so when it doesn't have immediate effect

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:29,770
so people are kind of like it's okay and

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:33,010
when there's no strict law enforcement

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:35,710
on that issues as well the company alike

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,429
they usually get away with it and when

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,980
the media doesn't push for them to take

00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,240
some kind of responsibility so it's kind

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,900
of like they wait and she was like you

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,150
know times goes by and yeah and wait

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,960
until everything is quiet things like

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,730
that mm-hmm

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,820
and it usually happens all the time in

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:58,030
this region which is that this indicates

00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:02,230
that cyber civility in this region is

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:04,510
very bad yes yes there is an article on

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,900
the ASEAN pose I think like

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:12,160
last month talking that so is anxious

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,660
actually like a hub for hackers in terms

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,460
of like you know stealing database

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,190
things like that mm-hmm

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:23,380
yeah and it's actually it's sad because

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,710
the government in countries in this

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,020
region they just like get alert on the

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:34,330
issues after the introductions of the

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:36,220
GDP are only because it affects the

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,679
countries in terms of economic and

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:45,250
business opportunity because the G tip

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:49,450
the GDP are actually forcing the company

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:53,020
outside of the European region to taking

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:55,570
care of the personal data of the

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:59,710
European citizens that live outside of

00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:02,440
the European Union as well so that's the

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,270
thing so that it just don't want to you

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,690
know lose the business opportunity

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:10,090
instead of nearly care about the

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:14,130
cybersecurity things like that mm-hmm

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:15,610
and usually the business that affected

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:19,049
the most

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:23,020
I like airline company hotel company

00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:29,470
those business like dealing with you

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:31,870
know people from outside so that means

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,270
for the company that's openly as smelly

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,669
in Thailand there won't be any like

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,350
elation light if yeah something like

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:39,520
that

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,160
like I mentioned before there's a

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,120
Personal Data Protection Act that

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,520
Thailand just passed and also at the

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,790
same time their cybersecurity act so two

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:56,020
laws together that Thailand just adopt

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:59,110
may in May this year and in terms of the

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,309
Personal Data Protection Act it will

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:09,220
come into full effect next year in May

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:11,799
but months have passed we haven't seen

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,840
much in terms of like the government

00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,250
effort in terms of like you know telling

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,990
the business company

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:23,980
how to prepare and in terms of like you

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:27,870
know comply with the law when it's going

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:30,580
to be fully enforced and also like

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:33,160
that's also I think that in this case

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:36,910
the business that are effective that are

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:41,200
the most warrior the medium and small

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:44,650
business for example we know that Thai

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,860
people this day we tend to use Instagram

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:50,170
to you know showcase the product and

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,000
service and then when we want those

00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,880
product or service we have to contact

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,130
the owner of the shop via light Live

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,340
Messenger right and then after the

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,440
transaction happen we give them like our

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,100
personal data for the products to be

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:10,200
delivered our name phone number and

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:14,560
address so it's like the question is how

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:18,370
how do we know that those information

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,560
that we gave to the vendors that run

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,660
like Instagram account and chops like

00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,030
that like micro business online micro

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,870
business secure or what they're gonna do

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,730
with it afterwards things like that and

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,740
it's worrying because sometimes those

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,110
shop like those who run the Instagram

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,630
account and run by just only one people

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,860
one like one single person and the

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,390
limited of the odd

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,820
there's the limitations of the law it's

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,160
like okay what do I do in terms of like

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,430
when the law come into full effect like

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,070
because they're gonna be fine if finding

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:56,800
something like no like in terms of like

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:57,250
if the data got leaked or exposed to the

00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,920
public

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,290
haha yeah like what they can do with as

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,280
a micro business owner things like that

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,320
mm-hmm

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:11,350
yeah so so far there hasn't been any

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:13,960
guideline yet thank you I think we ran

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,150
