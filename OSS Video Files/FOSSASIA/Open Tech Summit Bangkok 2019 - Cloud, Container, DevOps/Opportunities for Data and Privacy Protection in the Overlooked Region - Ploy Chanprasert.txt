Description: 
	Ploy Chanprasert

The session has an objective to explore possibilities of having a personal data
monitoring tool is free, easy to use, and open source for general public in Southeast Asia where efforts on cybersecurity and personal data and privacy protection are still limited. Many data breach incidents have not been handled properly looking at it from human rights perspectives. There are times that affected individuals are told to changed their passwords only without knowing where their personal data goes compared to those in
the first world countries where personal data monitoring service is offered. The tool, if there is a possibility to develop, would help protect people in data breach incidents in Southeast Asia. The session aims to discuss the possibility to develop this tool from  technical perspectives.
