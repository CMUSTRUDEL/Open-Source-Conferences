We have been writing Javascript for almost two decades now and it is showing up everywhere, including mobile apps, Servers, Devices, and Robots. But, Did you ever thought about the performance of your Javascript? or if there is still a better way to write JS which is faster? In this session, I will talk about the lessons I learned after cleaning up a 5-year-old code-base, proper ways to write your Javascript code, How handling typecasting, shortening scope chains, function chaining will improve the performance, How the usual way we do operations is not the fastest way to do it. I will also talk about How writing unnecessary steps can be expensive, and using supersets like Typescript can improve your code quality and performance. I will compare the performance of different approaches, and introduce tips and tools to validate the performance.
