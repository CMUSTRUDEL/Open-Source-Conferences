Title: An infrastructure on containers to build your own Debian based distro - Andrew Lee 李健秋
Publication date: 2019-10-20
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Cloud, Container, DevOps
Description: 
	Andrew Lee 李健秋

It is impressive how much time and resources a team can save by using the OBS infrastructure to manages their packages creation and distribution. OBS is a generic system to build and distribute packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way.This presentation will help existing and new software projects and independent software vendors better understand how to use morden infrastructure to maintain your packages and repositories for multiple distributions and architectures collaboratively. And will hopefully encourage more software projects and independent software vendors to use such infrastructure to provide repositories for user to keep track their updates easily, and for developers to collaboratively work and contribute easily to the packages and repositories.

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,390
anxiety attack so

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,370
[Music]

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:25,090
and then it was a project that only

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,090
supported

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:37,310
this marker and you just why so strong

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,310

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,220
for all these animals

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,390
yeah maybe

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,140
so

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,479
the class

00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:10,950
oh yes use in any way

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,950

so here is that easy - thanks

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,360
and you realized something here

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,440
possible okay

00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:46,339
why

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,660
see this is a example that I really

00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:03,850
haven't accomplished

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,850
so that things

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:14,610
oh you said this this is a fairly

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,450
obvious has a fielding see a lot of

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:33,960
vertical pole of each cells packaging

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,960
taco and try to comment below

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:45,590
so you can just go check out this one

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:58,680
[Music]

00:07:53,530 --> 00:08:00,860
and I have only properly

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,860
you

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,620
versatility

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:18,560
but if CI we wanted all the social

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,560
abuses and also

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,640
show us that console

00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,689
Oh

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:43,750
the police know that her project

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,160
and

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,500
the SS will be fine

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:13,120
okay determine probably said I said I

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,120
wasn't easy how we have

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,480
[Music]

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,879
those who automatically made

00:09:52,310 --> 00:10:06,829
we use a high demand for EMS so your

00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,829
obvious

00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:15,499
and then you see that no one had missed

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,659
[Music]

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,890
the only Naomi's family man

00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:55,870
so here's a beauty they stole his money

00:11:46,870 --> 00:12:01,120
in the service of EMV Wow well this

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:10,600
legacy that lives in excess of home is

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:14,370
part of my host was this one of the

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,370
disabled babies only

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:58,440
just evolution and survival tactics

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:05,580
really tango the language

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,830
boy while

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,540
yeah

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,320
we

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:36,810
okay you said that we want to management

00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,810
were at least

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:48,980
across parties that

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,490
Retta is what employer history of

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,490
various

00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:03,600
and then in Vegas uh business even if a

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:08,600
person is wise that only is only is

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,600
every one of us manageable

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,600
originals

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,600
always

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,630
ha

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,540
and those have

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,660
so

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:51,570
example that always then generally that

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:51,570
always are smart you have

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,560
like

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,560
the class that we became

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:20,899
okay then you can use a Holy See yes

00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:44,389
and father was seriously created by a

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:44,389
leader in Jakarta missile action and now

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,259
was ecstatic to go inside

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,570
and now boys

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,579
and

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,279
after that

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:35,830
showing how we basically that they made

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,340
out of particles if you want to see that

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,340
momentarily

00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:59,979
so we thought

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,770
prostate

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,680
is

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,389
we save all and then you

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:26,860
we dissolve this automatic view and

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:36,420
the reason why I said or 1.21 is that

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,420
what they want

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,930
Oh

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,420
[Music]

00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,199
[Music]

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Josias

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,009
and

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Horace

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,109
more

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,860
[Music]

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,860
okay this is

00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:13,549
the OAC

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,549
[Music]

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:22,890
and there's a party and I was at least

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,890
my command

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,039
because

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,849
[Music]

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
mommies

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:13,510
what will you tell miss this is a our

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:15,809
software much always and try and copy or

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,809
instead

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,840
why

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,640
and always

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,390
everything

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:52,440
so I see it is

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,440
it was obvious that

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:03,030
example that always

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,849
[Music]

00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:33,849
so here is a simple we use a previously

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,849
[Music]

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,740
and it was out when you have also here a

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:02,170
visa

00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,170
Jenny's view the package he had

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,029
we

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:20,460
any time

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:52,690
I promise

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,169
so again while

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,290
[Music]

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:25,220
and this one to the HLR

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,220
see networks

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:39,610
that's so and

00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,730
and it was a man I feel you

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:09,480
whoa and those always find you that

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,370
has anybody got any question

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,210
so

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,960
as i understand i think OBS was only for

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:03,760
debian-based ally or otter linux

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,760
architecture that's work

00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,160
[Music]

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:26,470
we still have some painting edges theory

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:29,380
and all Studies certificate but also be

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:34,059
aware that the advantages is not the

00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:36,220
same who said that have some support so

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:39,190
I don't encourage you to broaden such a

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:47,320
services hitting a guitar pocket I think

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:51,520
that because very well it is not a

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:54,270
stable release time so at least one I

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,270
encourage that

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:05,250
thank you

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:07,450
and always dissolution of madness

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,360
so many other students

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:13,630
you ought to see the whole detail I told

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:20,130
you to get the whole installation inside

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:20,130
and also the epidemic we use

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,500
[Music]

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:30,690
thank you okay

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,690
Thank You mr. and Rudy
