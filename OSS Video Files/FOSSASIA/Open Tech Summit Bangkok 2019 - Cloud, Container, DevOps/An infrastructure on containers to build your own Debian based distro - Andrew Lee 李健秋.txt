It is impressive how much time and resources a team can save by using the OBS infrastructure to manages their packages creation and distribution. OBS is a generic system to build and distribute packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way.This presentation will help existing and new software projects and independent software vendors better understand how to use morden infrastructure to maintain your packages and repositories for multiple distributions and architectures collaboratively. And will hopefully encourage more software projects and independent software vendors to use such infrastructure to provide repositories for user to keep track their updates easily, and for developers to collaboratively work and contribute easily to the packages and repositories.
