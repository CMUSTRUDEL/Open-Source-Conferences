	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,550
so my SQL troubleshooting and

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:13,650
performance analysis that's that's a

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,059
very broad topic I really poor topic and

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,820
and there are a lot of very very

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,640
interesting tools and opinions on the

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,279
internet right especially Stack Overflow

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,470
yes that's actually a long time we do

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,050
Google way yeah and then the first one

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,260
actually is that overthrow right exact

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,510
ways is that over role is there like a

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,180
problem yes well well you know we say

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,210
that we are that I that we are looking

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,120
for full stack overflow developers right

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,360
it's correct okay so is there any a

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,670
definitive resources that we can that we

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:55,530
can look or read to really really come

00:00:50,670 --> 00:01:01,559
to like get a grip of of like Microsoft

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:04,080
sorry my SQL performance analysis that's

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,500
what I'm going to talk about and I will

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,860
share some of the resources which is one

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,010
of those actually are in my top is

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,229
Dimitri

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,840
okay so Dimitri is a person but it's

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,210
also a website very exciting thank you

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,070
well let's give a round of applause for

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,880
Ivan and we're looking forward to

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,409
hearing from you

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,150
Thank You mistress and uh one of the

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,020
things that I wants to get your

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,650
attention

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,420
yes there is one thing okay do you like

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,520
to play games do you like to play games

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,960
love games yes

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:47,970
okay so I likes to share this game to

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:54,689
you this one so do you know what the

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,520
game is sudo go so can you do you know

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,110
what's the number at the three after

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,119
five three is what easy easy

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:11,250
this should be easy either is one two

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:14,520
four six eight nine right so can you do

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:19,860
you consider actually in SQL how to run

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,660
this so data is very important process

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,599
the data is also very important to

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,060
process the data how can you solve a

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,330
problem this is what we two days

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,310
everydays our life

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:35,879
am I correct so this is the problem

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:40,050
solving questions so how do we actually

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:49,050
do this so the problem is here and the

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:51,660
solution is here SQL so this is what it

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:56,310
is is command table expression but with

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:59,849
recursive way of doing things so here

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,750
that you do in here we have the problem

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,450
my problem which is the here my problem

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,409
and as the input with how many digits

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,269
the digit you sir 81 digits right so

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,489
it's actually my problem five suite of

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,050
bum bum bum right they are the ditches

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,019
and it is the problem

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,879
so the problem can be solved in here so

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:28,280
do you have the computer have you

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:32,010
installed MySQL 8 type it just joking ah

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,690
anyway yeah you can find my actually

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,489
tonight my slide and actually my block

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,379
as well and putting this actually on

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,200
blog and you can find it ok you can just

00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,239
put it at steps and copy/paste so my

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,670
problem and then this run will give you

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,739
the answer am i serious look at this

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:53,870
this is the problem of that map it runs

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,370
and this is this SQL statement in just

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,689
0.03 the answer is

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:03,450
ache for line 2 blah blah blah blah blah

00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:08,549
you see all this extras coming quickly

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:12,689
so I'm just actually in here to show we

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:15,689
are here everybody creating applications

00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:18,750
to solve problem so either you do it

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:21,609
this or you do it your own way but we

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:26,860
won some easy and handy

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:30,669
way of solving problem so MySQL SQL can

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,699
do this have you ever considered this is

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:36,759
actually very powerful and what we solve

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,669
problem is to solve some sort of data

00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,280
problem in many cases because we have

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:46,060
data we need to solve without the data

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,990
you know problem to solve consider no

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,389
input no output so that's the way the

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,659
data is actually being stored somewhere

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,900
and then we need to process so this is

00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:03,159
so close to the data bus which the data

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:08,830
sit on to it so this is just I put it a

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:14,319
sign another my favorite game and the

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:17,740
topic is not Sudoku sorry do this so

00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:21,430
this is in fact our topic so let's share

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,400
our main topic for today so

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:28,690
troubleshooting like I want to share

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,969
some good stuff which is we can use okay

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,969
in our daily if you are doing the daily

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:36,750
activity with database particularly in

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,949
here my desk oh but in fact

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,610
troubleshooting and life performance

00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:48,490
tuning is not just database this can

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:50,560
also be applied to anything else so uh

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,810
do you remember what we have talked

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,779
about the last three sections the first

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:59,139
one the very basic like DBA and also our

00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:01,089
commercial and commodity and my session

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,219
we've done you know DB cluster and also

00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:04,719
to train with long SQL and this is like

00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:07,060
all set already

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:10,120
and we actually retouch the system is

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,960
getting growing and growing we need to

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:18,699
be more performance or stable so we need

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:21,550
to look at those okay so they are so as

00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:26,289
troubleshooting where we look at

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:28,990
informations informations likely on the

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:31,630
screen something happened or complaint

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,000
or the log files am I correct

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,110
the doghouse okay we likely we see

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,170
issues okay

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,720
complain and then the system is very

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:45,500
slow and then we may look at the

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,180
monitoring okay whatever it is something

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,250
we'll report to you CPU is getting slow

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,350
memory is not enough okay

00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:00,700
something whatever we just put a coat

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:04,340
monitor so when there's issues okay we

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,730
have to what the first somebody will

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,660
tell

00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:11,420
ah surely down and we put the system is

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,850
it sometimes right sometimes Oh every

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,670
every day okay we put okay things

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:21,530
happening we put okay we have the first

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:23,660
week uh first we put okay so as like

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,420
another alternative people will look at

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,000
redundancy instead of we Buddhist we

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,760
have to put redundancy so that the

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,360
server's can actually be run on this

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:39,140
another redundant server and you can

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,050
look at this problem server problem if

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,150
you don't have to redundancy you cannot

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,080
touch this like the problem server

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,690
because we need to offer the servers

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,000
right immediately after the failure so

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,300
we need we done decease OHA is so

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,770
important so after this then we can take

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,660
a look and then we do like cross

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,820
analysis and then trouble soon right

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:09,470
so this is kind of okay yeah we need to

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:13,250
do this we may look at some other tools

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:16,760
in MySQL we look at their locks so the

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:20,060
loss maybe we have to look at where the

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,030
lock file is so there is somewhere we

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,000
put the log file the variable name law

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,000
errors warnings to the files that we put

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,230
it in and there is slow career locks

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,590
which it actually it points now the SQL

00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,960
statement which run for Wow which is

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:42,410
scripted ends the long carries variables

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,390
and there's also a general file which

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:48,050
points to a file which

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:51,320
any SQL statement it runs it will just

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:55,519
write to this law file with if we turn

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,980
this on gender locks and we may look at

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,980
the application of your application Java

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,910
PHP so they are also the information

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:07,490
that captures why there is errors why

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,959
there is problem we may look at the

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,980
system level or as trace whatever trace

00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:19,790
do you use s trace you do so you are

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:28,310
really engineering so s trace what else

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:32,690
so l SOF Oh LS Oh F it's like Oh which

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,209
open files is attached right so they are

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,320
kind of the tools that I usually look at

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,589
this LS Oh F

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,410
I was there MPs there so they are quite

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:46,550
good tools and also like perf tools

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,949
which has a lot of information some sort

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,880
of please there we instead so etc and

00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:56,019
there's one website so if you look at

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,519
yeah yeah even you have handful type it

00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:01,370
Dimitri

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:11,180
okay Kate aunt Frida fr type it and look

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:15,170
at it what it is the website this one

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,230
actually is a person it's a person who

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,810
create this many many years ago pass to

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,640
skipping always actually every reactive

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,170
and I like it

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,839
okay so there's other kind of tools for

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,640
system monitoring yeah and this one is

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,430
really free to use okay

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,890
Dimitri it trainer a graph and also

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,019
dictate what happens so I'm going to

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,959
talk about this into more quick the

00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:45,290
details and these are the kind of

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,120
enterprise tools in my school we expect

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,060
people knows about MySQL Enterprise

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,600
monitor I know there are many other

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:57,320
kinds no matter this is like the

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,020
enterprise company HP IBM

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,840
okay or yeah whatever out there from

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:08,390
interests there are many type of

00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:11,600
monitoring tools so look at some basic

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,330
information about my soul okay the

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,660
website does it work

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,850
yep so just register this website

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:24,620
okay later on you will see a love with

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:27,080
stuff from there so here the first thing

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:32,690
he is talking about performance and sis

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:38,690
kima there is a so core the diagnostic

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:40,460
function so find my SQL from 5-7 so what

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:45,650
is the current version of mascot the

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:49,580
latest latest one oyster is coercion the

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:53,210
current version why is it is it eight

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:59,420
okay so the previous one seven no five

00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:03,140
seven it is five seven and now is it so

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,420
even these do you know what date okay we

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,240
caught GA the first release date okay

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,510
the first release date of MySQL five

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:16,360
seven okay what's the date okay what's

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:23,480
the years the year of the GA date four

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:26,090
five seven do you know when this is the

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,820
first release 19 ideally because 24

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,790
years good okay anyway you remember well

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:37,790
I've has this to you but my question is

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:43,240
not that that one so five seven ways to

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:48,860
release date for MySQL five seven no

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:52,910
2001 five five seven is 2001 five MySQL

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:55,640
it is 2001 in April meaning that last

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:59,000
year in April the MySQL egg release it

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:04,040
has been in the market for one and half

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,320
years so whatever so called the plot we

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,410
have a life cycle

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,560
no matter what when we have a kind of

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,430
plow

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,190
to go to a lifecycle okay open source

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,040
there's a lifecycle it is you create one

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,770
and then never end never end it means

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,920
nobody support nobody actually they are

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:28,650
interested in it if no lifecycle right

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,730
it's just be there and then never change

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:35,160
means no one is interested in it so if

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,339
someone interested in it meaning that

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:42,000
there are changes that changes ongoing

00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:46,430
and the version will be up moving so the

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:51,600
product in Oracle has a process a

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:54,120
product is released over five years we

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,839
will schedule this products to be like

00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,870
going going going down okay we call five

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,279
years after ga date and then we will go

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:08,010
into the extended model and then forever

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,310
motto okay extend the three years and

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,980
then such thing forever that means there

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,839
are like eight plus more years okay for

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,620
each product but for the five years it

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:23,100
means that we are no longer we are no

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:29,790
longer to put new things onto that five

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:33,650
seven new things five sevens start the

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:37,800
release date was our two oh one five

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:43,380
five years after two oh one five years -

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:47,430
OH - oh that means next year two months

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,940
later so I'm telling you something

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:56,610
actually five seven is kind of going

00:14:49,940 --> 00:15:00,390
there right so people look at 8.0 Y

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:06,000
because there's nobody we tries to keep

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:08,370
an old plan up forever we have a console

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,760
in the middle already and it is actually

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,020
people using it when anything new we put

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,250
on to new things not to put backs to the

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:23,400
old things right so that's the reason

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,590
move up through my escape answer it is

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,250
time to run

00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:31,280
egg pan so here I'm talking about the

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,860
sistema it has been there even in five

00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,550
seven five years ago

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:41,080
so that means when people has Prague

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:45,110
Wow good thing is you can run call

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,370
sister diagnostic there is a package

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:52,220
there is a functions it will generate

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:57,410
the information internally informations

00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:02,480
as a report so do you know what is the

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:04,330
Oracle command to run this kind of

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,820
report

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:16,400
do you know step back

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:18,830
oh who is running Oracle please Oracle

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,160
DBA Oh No

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,850
then why is the Microsoft way to

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,070
Microsoft

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:32,260
how can you generate a report where's

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:35,840
the package sis SP what monitor Sybase

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,690
right so no matter what every products

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,280
they have a package and system service

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:46,400
to run a report so this is like you

00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,430
invoke this it will try to generate over

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,370
to time durations one in twenty I mean

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,220
two minutes over the two minutes to

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,790
gather the report at the interval of 30

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,250
second so there will be doubter sorry

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,560
after 30 second after thirty second

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,260
after thirty second so it captured the

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,959
Delta Delta Delta and at the end this is

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,240
they are the report and we know how many

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,860
I always have the CPU differences what

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,660
are the laughs and what are the table

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,520
activities and what are the SQL

00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,240
statements running and what the table

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,510
structure actually changed so they will

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:30,020
be captured and those actually important

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:34,150
for us to know and in particular when we

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,910
have problem we may ask people for help

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:41,850
am I correct

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:45,530
if you ask people to help so gentlemen

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:50,010
please help me then what do you say

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,559
please help me then what do you say you

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,350
ask question am i correct so what kind

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,929
of question you ask please help I have

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,910
problem and this guy just say I have

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:04,620
problem please help and then what you

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:07,320
say what are the symptoms well the

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,409
symptoms and then you have so many

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,230
questions instead of giving a chance for

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:15,360
him to speaker we passed the reports to

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,299
him and then you look at the first they

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,210
are actually the water-base are we are

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,340
running okay by one time what kind of

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,610
objects what kind of secrets Damon what

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,380
kind of laughs so that's the ways that

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,580
we collect the information and pass to

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:35,940
somebody he may have basic Elysa basic

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:39,690
information and then we can go and talk

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,429
with our information is like Q&A for a

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,490
week

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:48,030
am i correct so this is kind of good

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,190
stuff we can actually dive into there

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,679
are things like the involvements where

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,130
we put this or are the port number and

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,080
version what you use a lot of time when

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,500
we discuss and then talk to somebody to

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,360
help them what version do you use are

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,230
you running linux or microsoft so you

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,480
have to answer a lot of questions

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:14,360
instead of just Q and a this is to

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,580
report okay just shut the mouth up right

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,330
it is quite important we share this and

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:24,570
there are also the changes regarding so

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,669
then we ask what variables do you use do

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,770
you set this do you set this and how

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:32,880
much memory do you use there are a lot

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:36,090
of things it is all inside the report so

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,299
and many things that happen in the

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,539
database about transaction that log or

00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:45,870
memory and how it is written so they are

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:48,260
actually in the in ODB engine status it

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:52,100
is in the report

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,200
it is actually across two times line 30

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,250
seconds 30 seconds 30 seconds so it's

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,540
not just one

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:02,870
so there are Delta changes along the

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:06,500
time so along the time the changes may

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:10,700
indicate something I do or activities

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:14,950
and there is also redundancy the

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:18,440
replication information here is none ah

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:22,490
something but actually this actually

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,190
give informations to the support of

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,160
people supporting you to net you know

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,620
okay ah you're running the Imam and with

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,110
not just one server to serve the three

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,850
serve and how it works and does it

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,850
actually gives some information and

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:41,330
their arm in some other information what

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:45,590
is the file IO how the activity they

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:47,120
will be shown in the report directly so

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,940
without being asked

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,720
they are like the best practice you see

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:57,770
is where they put in to like a script

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,750
and just to run and then you can see so

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:03,890
from day to day maybe this is also a

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,870
good report and then you keep track day

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,530
to day because this is not very happy

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,420
there are heavy one you just turn the

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,830
parameters you want a full report or

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:18,140
medium already just really like wait so

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,810
basically this can actually generate

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,680
some kind of clusters file and also how

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:27,470
memory is used and they are more and

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,560
schema information and it tells how big

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,870
the system is how many tables and where

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,770
they put those actually things and so

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:40,220
they are over there so this structure to

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,110
certain point did one look at those they

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,760
have the idea how big your system and

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:51,710
what we actually we talk and there are

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:55,700
things regarding all this how the IO is

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:59,150
not how much is actually the percentile

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,130
okay the 95 percentile IO is on this

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:06,630
file okay then it's

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:10,520
I like all this like the high peak okay

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:13,950
objects and a spy SQL statement and also

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,900
what the latency for the threat between

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:21,480
the server okay it's also highlight and

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,210
by the latency with the file IO and also

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,110
the waiting and also the index

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:32,700
statistics they are important for people

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,740
to support and to look at it so this is

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,920
kind of another statistic it has two

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,980
idea what the report will show the

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,640
update latency and it will tell all you

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,950
are kind of the feeling when the one who

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,620
knows how to read this data if you know

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,690
that oh that may be a table always three

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,820
and the latency is too high your IO

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,980
maybe the problem marry and then it will

00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:01,580
jump into what the actually can be the

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:04,980
solution you can see there is also the

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,170
IO waiting and the background and what

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,250
is actually doing and the binary is

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:14,460
actively being written and in many cases

00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:17,880
MySQL if something being actually

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:21,210
working on the database it has to be the

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,670
we do la and do la so many cases they

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,090
are really the top three love out they

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:30,030
didn't um okay in many cases they are so

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,850
they are very important but we fell this

00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:36,000
chart you never know where to put maybe

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,870
it is good idea from this you understand

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,050
the IO eternity it is very hot and

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:46,560
active on some files and some specific

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,160
actions then what we do and make it

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,680
better

00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:55,740
is okay I may put this specific files to

00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,560
somewhere else which is SSD or some

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,070
other storage instead of right now this

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:06,330
is very strong we can split the i/o so

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:09,810
they are the important files and those

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:13,310
you can see the latency to update okay

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:15,810
they are the things it will be very very

00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,080
detail and highlight

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:24,050
what they do is not by file it's by

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:27,390
action by action talking about your

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,970
activity we are not talking about your

00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:33,120
server is just idle and you run the

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:35,580
report your system is running and you

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,820
run the report and at that time what

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,360
kind of tivity mainly the latency is

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,640
putting there and what are the stress we

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,980
are putting there and how we are solving

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,630
this performance here at least we

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,470
understand and then we know what to look

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:58,560
at

00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:03,270
they are the key so by default MySQL has

00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:06,180
all this a lot of details to look into

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:10,050
it you see to run this diagnostic it

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:13,370
come up with the report and they also

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:17,370
also the Delta status that's what I said

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:21,300
interval 30 second it will tries to dig

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:24,750
out information once it's up to you 120

00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,810
30 they are the parameters so it's up to

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,880
use to get the Delta of 30 second or the

00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:35,750
Delta of one minute or Delta for one

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:38,550
hours likely it may be not too short or

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:42,120
even not too long right it has to be

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:44,190
takest to yeah your application so here

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,620
you can see the downer you can see on

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,690
writing to the log file it is like this

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,630
and memory and also statement during

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:55,380
this time it is running this ABC SQL

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:58,710
statement so there is also other system

00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,180
matrix the matrix which talking about

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,870
how many selects them and how many

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:08,220
update how many there are many counter

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:10,860
counter in the system so by comparing

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,290
the delta we know during that time how

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,200
many transaction iran's how many select

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,650
statement iran's how many updates daemon

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,870
reruns so there are so many doubter

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:26,400
cantor or even the binary log cache and

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:29,730
the disk and i/o right okay all this

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,730
information they are the contour

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,430
in the system we compare the mattress we

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:40,500
understand half the idea what are the

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:44,420
activity during your monitoring stage so

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,850
they are all there is this enough or

00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:51,930
what is so-called the best practice so I

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:55,020
just mentioned a kind of tools very

00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:57,540
useful and everybody can run because I

00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:01,380
don't use any tools it's just the

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:05,760
database itself it has it but do you

00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:10,440
know that do you know that even you're

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:13,920
running MySQL you never try right who

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:19,800
else my SQL help do you know that that

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:22,560
Gnostic you never will you try yes

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,930
because just so simple right just to run

00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,080
and then the report is there why not

00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:31,890
so I'm here is to let you know there is

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,930
something but is this just enough just

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:39,150
tax is it good I don't like just text

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,370
okay but anyway do we have a very good

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,830
practice effects practice there's so

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,680
caught up to you everybody is the best

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:51,030
practice is different because everybody

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:56,010
has their own constraint anyway so we

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:59,070
need to look at okay our own okay so

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:03,200
monitoring is a must so we have we have

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,850
to know things performance 101 evidence

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,490
okay you tell me you have problem I

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:13,920
don't trust right you tell me it's

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:16,950
running very yeah slow I okay slow to

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,620
you maybe very fast to me okay one

00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:23,370
second to you is fast one second to me

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:26,100
is slow so everybody to tell this kind

00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:29,010
of statement is okay we need to find the

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:32,490
evidence so the evidence we have to

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:35,160
issue some sort of report Tainan stick

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:37,230
and then I look at it and what you look

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,110
at it and I look at it okay all your

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,570
slowly is this okay so we have to

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,260
compare the measure what your statement

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,510
yes

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,510
so we don't trust okay every works.we

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:52,140
but we listens to the we listen to you

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:54,870
and then we find ways to get your get

00:28:52,140 --> 00:29:00,150
the evidence for what you said so

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:05,910
monitoring is important so this is kind

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:11,309
of the report look at that URL it is

00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:14,460
that URL to generate all this reports it

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:17,179
will show this kind of activity talking

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,140
a little benchmarking so some time

00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,790
performance okay

00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,530
it's like you have problem and then you

00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:28,260
fix benchmarking is something you have

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,990
you do not have the problem first but

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:34,190
you go back to the early days zero and

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,270
plan that's the benchmark so

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,150
benchmarking is some sort of you

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:42,809
anticipate what will happen in there

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,370
putting in the magic is your magic and

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:47,130
then generate the challenge then you

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:50,340
foresee what will happen and what you

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:56,669
have to change so here there is actually

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:59,520
talking about update online sections so

00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:03,270
here the section is going a lot a lot a

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,730
lot and here the activity getting a lot

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,280
a lot a lot okay but there will be yeah

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,650
more users who do update and today we go

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:14,700
up but at some point is just set it down

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:18,330
there the system just to be able to run

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,970
ten years ten it cannot run 100 cannot

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:26,760
be linear at all time it has to be slow

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:29,210
down as per to so when we do like

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,520
performance tuning it's a infinite loop

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,160
tuning we change something and then come

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:39,179
and then we change another thing portal

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:43,410
next it's never be able to solve because

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,240
spot owner is just a movable is you fix

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,870
this so-called important let it move to

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,570
somewhere else

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:50,640
you fixed so call the CPU and it will be

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,429
the i/o you fix the i/o will be backs to

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,650
the CPU and all this Joe just going

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:57,090
around am I correct

00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:01,590
just is that

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:04,710
enough to you and your system okay the

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:09,030
performance so likely applications

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:10,500
contribute the 95% area that we can fix

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,540
the issue okay

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,640
no matter the problem is done they at

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,910
the bottom you change the way how it

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,250
works and weigh it or do it the other

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,200
way we fix the issues doesn't mean that

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,710
yeah we cannot actually do things but

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,480
likely contributing to the problem 95%

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,510
is just the application and the design

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,560
and the rest we still wants to look at

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,990
it at this point

00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:38,550
we focus on the database and what we can

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:41,130
do so there are little many tools to

00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,840
count to to work on the benchmarking so

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,720
we need some kind of tool to generate

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,610
the loads and then from there we make

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,660
sure that ok we understand the system

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,230
behavior so all this you may find see

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,800
spange

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,810
DBT 2 or whatever kind of the ideas ok

00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,070
generate the routing and there is also

00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:06,090
the default my s code is my SQL slap do

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:09,900
you know that my SQL slap no my SQL SLA

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:12,000
P D so it is a deep it is a process to

00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,760
generate the multi thread and generate a

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,800
random screw statement and then create

00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,310
data and select multi thread and then it

00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:23,340
is a low stressing tool but very great

00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:26,220
dummy very tell me but it can actually

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,530
ask you to input the SEO statement and

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,200
structures up to you and then it's you

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,630
to provide the SQL statement it's just

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,730
threat management to run ten threat at

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,440
the same time and then when you exit a

00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,910
run again so this is like a jmeter

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:47,520
jmeter right so you don't understand

00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:51,480
that tools so now get to another core in

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,360
ten minutes I finished that Dimitri you

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,700
look at this win am I correct

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,370
when you hook up this is the screen so

00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,850
this is tool and it has a server it has

00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:05,670
the agent so what that means here the

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:10,350
server and the agent agent is to collect

00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:12,450
the statistic from your target server

00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:18,059
and then that will collect the data and

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:20,520
put it back to the server and chart so

00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,350
there are things in here the

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,309
presentation that's quite a good one

00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,120
okay

00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:29,940
if you have time just look at it and you

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,070
go into there and then you install there

00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,169
are you download the surfaces table war

00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,960
and then you do all this blah blah blah

00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:40,530
anyway I just put it here for the sick

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,630
the slide will be yes spreading out and

00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,090
you can actually find and then you can

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:48,419
do it your own so the data collections

00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:51,600
when it is run so here when this is

00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:53,880
executed so what we do here when this is

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,640
installed and I install as the

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,830
statistics server surface this says

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,030
statistics service as the binary I run

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:05,370
it so what I do is when I collect when

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,730
this collection tool is to run it has to

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:11,070
connect to database and grab information

00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,560
it connect to database it also collects

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,690
system data system they receive here you

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,450
and all this like new tags and kernel

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:22,679
parameters so this is like CPU or this

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:24,600
collect data not just MySQL but if I

00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,470
need to connect to MySQL I need to

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,619
provide the connection detail where this

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:34,500
is like once install we need to put in

00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:37,109
edit the doc environment MySQL and then

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,090
change the connection and use the name

00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:41,250
password so it connects to it and then

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,280
grab the information back so once they

00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:47,100
in store and then you have this and you

00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,220
can actually turn this all and you can

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:53,190
run so the to run it is it's quite easy

00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:56,580
okay so there is just run a single

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,580
command easy collect it's really easy

00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,340
step easy okay there are many command

00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,850
but there is one very easy way and the

00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,619
command is easy start with easy EA sy so

00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,530
you look at it and you'll see that is a

00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:14,130
collection of collection a collection of

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:19,020
collection tools so once we have all

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:22,220
this so like here you see this here to

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:25,520
test test test test at the end there is

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:29,490
easy step you see easy

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,770
so the first just an example I wants to

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,080
collect a mutex information I wants to

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:37,589
collect you know DPI wants to collect my

00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,980
SQL there are many there are many tools

00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:42,960
shell script right there okay but I

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:49,200
don't care I mean I don't care

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:52,500
I run easy step the easy step will

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,930
collect all this data and this data will

00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,600
be just be there and it will be sipped

00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:00,330
because the data will be a lot and this

00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,970
tool will collect collect let and by

00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:06,300
time it will sip it up one foul but I'm

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,619
keep it up because tax is very

00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,960
compressible

00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:16,350
tax very complex able so if we do this

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,230
job and once we have this we can go back

00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,930
because the flower is a lot of many sip

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,420
because many a times thumbs if we go

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,780
back and then comes to the server and

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,369
this is like a just say environment

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,680
that's what I said I put the connection

00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:34,830
I need to change and they are the binary

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,770
right so this is the tool and I run

00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:41,369
these tools and easy step and put where

00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:44,250
I put the data collection data and for

00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:47,760
how long and turn out so for 10 second

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:52,320
every time and running for one hour this

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,390
is so simple install run data is back o

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,670
theta is there no tools to visualize

00:36:54,390 --> 00:37:02,880
that useless so visualizations install

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:05,190
so a process to install is here and

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,470
download so from here to download from

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:10,950
here and the servers will be just to run

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:14,850
so it's just install script install not

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:18,150
Sh right you get to town top our install

00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,950
top message in there install once the

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,780
install is all there and then package

00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:26,250
and then you have to put in parameters

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:29,520
and after all this install at the end so

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:32,670
whatever it is stop very first time to

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,809
start very first time you see right here

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:39,150
there is team start here and then it

00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:42,660
means not forced just only the first

00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:44,670
time to start this and they later on you

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,150
just stop okay the first time it's not

00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:50,040
force and then it just start where every

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,960
first time after you storm actually the

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,440
instruction is there when you install

00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,930
last demon say it tells you so once you

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,760
get this the server is up and you have

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,970
to browser and connect to your pot

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,339
number on your server okay you just find

00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:08,369
another way em and then install it and

00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:12,839
you have this page and go into the home

00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:16,589
page main page welcome welcome and you

00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:19,500
will get into a page and those all the

00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:22,200
charts will come in okay but how do we

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:26,849
do this welcome and then you get into

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,710
this page okay but the data we have the

00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,140
data but before we have the data we have

00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:34,440
to create repositories to load the data

00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:38,910
into debt repository it is in here so we

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:42,210
put this analyzed but analyze to do this

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:45,270
first to analyze so here to generate the

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:47,790
chart we analyze and come into here we

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:50,819
select the corresponding data and choose

00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:53,099
multi host sx example multi host and

00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:55,680
then put in and you choose all this

00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:59,160
coming up and I will choose okay all the

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,089
data and select one of those okay but

00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,200
where those data

00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:06,359
I haven't upload the data this is I go

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,089
to the end and I will come back and then

00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,450
show you how we generate the entry in

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:15,450
here so you can choose suppose at this

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,460
point you do not have data okay if the

00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:20,430
data is back I upload and you see

00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,490
entries so what there is and then you

00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:26,970
upload and you will see all this and

00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:31,380
then go I will see all the chart and a

00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:36,630
lot many charts will be there it will be

00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:41,450
all the charts okay so what how we do

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:44,040
this collect the data we hit conferences

00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,700
actually we need to hit the Preferences

00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,450
and create a new database

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:53,550
because this is a dataset we create a

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,820
database to load the data into these

00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:59,580
datasets and create this and we put it

00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,070
into my Isom or you know DP so I change

00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:06,300
this to you know DB and once we do this

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:08,790
at the end okay their preference done

00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,960
the Preferences done we have the files

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:17,460
we get better files in here and the

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:22,830
files in here and what we do what we do

00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:31,830
in here is from we have all this

00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:34,620
sea-fowl G set unzip the file okay so we

00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,220
need to unzip all the file is a big

00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,440
files

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:40,650
many big files and we need to change

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,130
okay

00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:46,680
in the folder there is a file call where

00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,290
is the farmer named load data Sh

00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,110
so the zip file and in the folder

00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:55,260
there's one file called low as such go

00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,840
into it and change and change the name

00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,570
which I create a database create and you

00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,930
put a name so that's the base and put

00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:07,710
the name so once we put a name right

00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:09,570
there and then the title is just so to

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,480
shoot to be shown on the screen by the

00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:17,130
line and then once we have all this we

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,170
execute this and then execute and Baxter

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,710
then you can choose and the graph will

00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:25,550
be there so easy and very buildable and

00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:28,590
all the CPU chart in ODB memory all

00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,950
there and then if you have chart and

00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:34,770
then you can compare you have the idea

00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:36,960
what happen and all the locks are all

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:41,880
the informations that is not just text

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:50,180
is graph and charts okay so any

00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:50,180
questions yes any questions

00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,690
you

00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:03,469
right

00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:19,200
hello so if you look at like a system

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,670
function or system variables so it's

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,490
mean like is we can use this after after

00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,500
something wrong happy right so we are

00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:34,620
Queen so when something wrong happened

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:37,680
like the CPU is consume a lot of like a

00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:41,370
resources on the memory spoon or

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,190
something like that so and then we we

00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:47,790
come to the system were able to see what

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:49,380
what happened so it is that any like a

00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:53,760
system variable or system function that

00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:57,900
that can monitor and then we can sense

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,850
like a the trade show when something

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,850
wrong when something is going to reach

00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,870
the trade show and then it's going to to

00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:09,830
notify or or do anything back to the

00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:12,960
system admin or inform the system and

00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:15,780
okay thank you so this is like a

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,120
preventive measure so one of the thing

00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,210
is like as what you said it's like the

00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,550
post mortem well what is envy cells

00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:26,100
coming up and people complain then we

00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:28,020
put action in but the other way is you

00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:32,160
are taking talking about best practice

00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:34,680
okay so things like our threshold you

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,470
prevent people from changes to even

00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,820
higher values or actually like the sick

00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,830
of statement is running too long so you

00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,980
actually we are we have to proactively

00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:48,120
to tell there's something wrong so what

00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:52,850
we talk about this from the commercial

00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,850
point we have the tools we call this

00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:03,000
there is the enterprise monitor in the

00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,220
first part of this yeah in the first

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,780
talk and the price monitor is the

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:13,710
commercial package I mean when we have

00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,750
unions you subscribe my SQL commercial

00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,520
version there is backup there is a

00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,370
security concern there's also

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,759
manageability monitor the monitor has

00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:27,549
the features we call advisor

00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:31,420
advisor we have over twelve hundred and

00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:34,690
fifty two five zero more advisors in

00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:38,109
this in the monitors what those actually

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:39,490
are they are the light jobs and tasks

00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,579
and the scatterer

00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:47,130
which to run on schedule

00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:50,559
to check parameters or configuration

00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:53,289
like password for the security like

00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,140
specific variable which you specify but

00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:58,599
should not be so they are all this kind

00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,599
of like preventive measure we call this

00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,509
a visor or best practice okay we

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,289
implement in the monitor and this is I

00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:15,240
hope this actually the tools which you

00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:28,170
maybe look at it any second question

00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:31,660
thank you thank you yes okay I am using

00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:34,660
MySQL version 5 heists Evan and I want

00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,230
to make it to wish on it do I can up get

00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:45,640
it right away

00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:49,839
are you something bread thank you so how

00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:55,599
is to upgrade who has wastin any OSX

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:57,700
experience to upgrade you long time ago

00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,750
do you have way Microsoft to Yahweh

00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:04,839
Linux yes do you have great Oracle do

00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:12,640
you outweigh any like Firefox what do

00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:14,559
you do click the button yeah just take

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,240
the action right so the most important

00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,440
you take the action without taking

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:24,420
action it's not changed so how do we do

00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,420
upgrade right your question how

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:40,610
okay released I said take it here is an

00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,590
example my company used English on five

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,350
or six for really long time and they

00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:47,530
insist are not up getting to version X

00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:51,260
so they might have daily send for that

00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:53,600
so I think maybe it's maybe some listen

00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:58,100
that of care to wish and ate my not

00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:00,800
compatible with the O version I look at

00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,200
just the PHP example vp7 is not

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:09,590
compatible with PHP if I are something

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:13,550
like that that's all exactly so have you

00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:14,210
done upgrade so in many cases when we do

00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:17,900
upgrade

00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:21,080
there's for sure a risk for sure there's

00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,800
a risk you upgrade and you fail and my

00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:27,920
ESCO is very generous many times upgrade

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,820
is just work many times it's just work

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:36,920
and if you try to make a guess why

00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:39,410
people not too up Rea many reason is to

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,040
Mia when I look at it many reasons just

00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:45,380
very simple just we do not want to move

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,070
anywhere because we don't need to move

00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:51,980
because things just work why move in

00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,870
stuff instead of talking about move to

00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,880
this and there's problem they haven't

00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,530
tried yet

00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,020
they haven't tried yet how do they know

00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:02,840
there's a risk or there is problem only

00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,840
when the time they actually the problem

00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,980
happened then we actually stick to what

00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:12,590
happened the first hours usually in the

00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,830
echo and so is the connection the

00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:18,940
connection is the problem okay usually

00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:24,160
when those problems from security

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:27,380
because security cannot be generous

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,890
security we enforce the security and

00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:34,280
means some has to be changed in certain

00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:39,440
way moscow 8 we changed the way to

00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:43,220
enforce a security but we can turn this

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,839
off but we have to make sure that you

00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,140
are well aware

00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:50,749
security enforcement so by having to

00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,729
upgrade the first time and the client

00:48:50,749 --> 00:48:55,069
with the old version usually when we

00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:57,769
upgrade it's just the server the client

00:48:55,069 --> 00:49:00,170
also need to upgrade something if it is

00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:02,359
JDBC driver or whatever driver to

00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:06,109
connect there's something but nobody

00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:10,249
care and connect and this one is Oh to

00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:14,059
connect to new so the security may brick

00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:16,660
may brick so that's actually one point

00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:20,479
there are many other things may be the

00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:24,619
parameters we put up something but in

00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:27,339
many cases they are not a concern 99%

00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:32,150
there are no concern but the connection

00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:35,420
security part is the first part thank

00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:38,599
you and if I may actually add to that as

00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,849
I see this happening very often ok so

00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:44,180
the first thing is that when you develop

00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:46,549
applications you always need to write

00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:49,519
your applications with tests with

00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,900
automated tests right so that is the

00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,450
only way that you know that your

00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,269
application actually works under all

00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:59,779
circumstances if you don't write your

00:49:56,269 --> 00:50:01,549
tests basically it's the reason you call

00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:03,589
it software is because it's easy to

00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:06,589
change if it's no longer easy to change

00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:08,660
its hardware and the only way that you

00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:11,479
can maintain it as being software is to

00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,979
use practices like TDD or having a whole

00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:19,819
suit of automated tests right the second

00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:21,049
thing which I always recommend people do

00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:24,650
when they write the application has

00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:27,589
people have this tendency of making this

00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,660
huge ball of code where your stuff in

00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:31,910
all your business logic your view logic

00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,910
your your database connection logic

00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:41,900
everything into just one little PHP file

00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:44,269
right or one huge PHP file so what I

00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,519
always say is that the the part of your

00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:47,900
ok so let me put it this way ok when you

00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:49,700
do your file reads and writes

00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,469
do you actually worry whether your heart

00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:56,930
this is eSATA or or SSD or or anything

00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:58,700
else no the reason for that is because

00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:02,089
there's a file access layer

00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,680
that handles all and the file access

00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:05,779
layer and the driver that handles all

00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,890
the particulars of your hard disk so in

00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:09,710
the same way when you write your

00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,869
applications you need you always need to

00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,089
abstract away your data access layers

00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:15,950
right and to make sure that that is

00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:18,500
independent from the rest of your code

00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:21,289
this way while you're working on the top

00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,359
part the business logic someone else can

00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:25,730
be working on the on the access layer

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,099
and testing it against the new version

00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:32,720
of MySQL that is very important

00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:36,890
yes thank you sorry my two cents Thanks

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,230
there's a really good yeah your

00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:42,170
questions and you know we always face

00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,480
this one when we work with customer and

00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:49,369
for the initial deployments we always

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,579
ask people to apply during the testing

00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:54,500
phase usually when we start our projects

00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,539
there is ongoing and there will be

00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,359
another release and some sort of

00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:01,640
actually during the process people start

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,160
to stick to one version and never move

00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:09,650
but during this process we put in place

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:12,349
a so-called upgrade process then after

00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:15,349
this deployments they have seen that

00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:17,869
they have tested up gray and in the

00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:21,559
testing all the early stage they will

00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:23,990
see upgrades plausible otherwise when

00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:26,930
they see upgrade them they will Wow

00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:31,309
they face to do anything they stop to

00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:34,160
move so build this upgrade process into

00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:37,220
the plan at very early stage this will

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:41,390
be very flexible for the upcoming

00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:45,650
project or actual deployment ok so I

00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:47,329
think times is up all right well thank

00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:51,770
you very much Ivan and Ryan please give

00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:54,190
them a hand will you guys be at the

00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,190
dinner tonight

00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:05,500
at the social dinner ok but we have time

00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:07,950
to go right to we have plans

00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:11,010
