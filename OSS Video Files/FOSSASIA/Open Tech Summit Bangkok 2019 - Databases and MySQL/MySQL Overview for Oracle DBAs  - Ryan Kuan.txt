Description: 
	Ryan Kuan - MySQL

MySQL is the most popular open source database used and trusted by millions of users for cloud, internet and mobile applications. More and more enterprises are evaluating open source database technology as alternatives to their existing Oracle database. In this session, we will help existing Oracle DBAs to understand MySQL better as a viable database platform to  complement existing Oracle database.

I'd like to pass it on to my SQL team

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,690
for our first session which is a

00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:16,109
beautiful article yes thank you very

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:24,289
much okay thank you

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:26,910
sherry so my name is Ryan from the MySQL

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:32,040
solution engineering team for Asia

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:35,340
Pacific based out of Malaysia so it's

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,879
just a short flight two hours to Bangkok

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,750
so with me today is Ivan you know my

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,960
colleague from Hong Kong so two of us

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:51,390
won't deliver for session this session

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:57,079
is very introductory right it's targeted

00:00:51,390 --> 00:01:01,770
to people who have used database before

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,629
however this is not a debate session to

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,260
compare one to one right

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:13,020
what is the equivalent come on in Oracle

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:19,369
to MySQL and it also tells you when or

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,369
why you should use Oracle or MySQL okay

00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:28,380
any problem with that but do do ask me a

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,930
question since we are small cloud you if

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,729
you face any problems using you know

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,400
some concept that you're not very clear

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,840
you know we are here to to help clear

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,680
clear the doubts okay so this talk is

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,409
about major differences between Oracle

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:53,100
and MySQL and also to tell you what are

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:56,610
the masculine architecture for

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:01,890
enterprise deployment right I think we

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:08,099
shall talk about mass QL how scalable it

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:11,940
is right do you use Facebook Facebook's

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:15,470
like so Facebook uses mass girl

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:20,420
right so when Mark Zuckerberg started

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:25,440
Facebook actually games PHP PHP and

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:30,750
Moscow I recently just read watched a

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:34,050
movie social network in the middle of

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,700
the scene Mark Zuckerberg was saying oh

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:49,680
I need more server for MySQL and PHP

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:56,180
right so it's an open secret before I go

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:58,650
on any question that you might have

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:09,740
before coming to this section what you

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:09,740
want to find out just do just to learn

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,150
you should be teaching so I think if you

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,600
are visited our roof down stay we have a

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:29,120
banner saying the top five for website

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:34,560
runs on Moscow so these are some of the

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,440
bigger you know businesses a unicorn

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:46,940
that using Moscow right you can see

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:51,510
Twitter Facebook YouTube using MySQL

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:55,500
sorry idea for you just get started we

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:59,100
asked everybody questions any databases

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,980
that you are familiar with what database

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,680
are you currently using or you just come

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:17,060
here to to learn I'm just asking what is

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:17,060
your experience of using database sorry

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,400
[Laughter]

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,080
all verification all right so I think

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:39,500
yeah this is a session to talk about you

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:43,720
know the basic of masculine and more

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,780
example right how people are using MySQL

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,510
now Oracle so I'm gonna ask you because

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,940
you said you'll use Oracle what is the

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,940
difference between thirty percent schema

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,210
[Laughter]

00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,489
[Music]

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:26,030
non-relational I'm not exactly right

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:30,020
what I know is database it is a

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:33,860
structure of storing beta and then

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,430
schema usually is related to user so you

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,270
can create a database and then you know

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,720
onto tables using a user schema all the

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:48,730
database table objects owned by that the

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,980
schema so schema it's similar to user

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,530
however in mysql we don't have that

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,520
concept right so database is similar to

00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:12,820
schema so there's no concept of of

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:18,280
schema you know user holding got it so

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:20,750
database and schema it's not exactly a

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,840
difference in masks all right so they

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,300
are similar so in MySQL we don't

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:38,560
actually have a user at the owns a

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:38,560
database all right yeah yeah it is

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,070
[Music]

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:13,470
okay so question is how do we clarify

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:18,030
the table is owned by a user

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:21,330
so yeah as we said we don't really have

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,850
you know that concept in mask um so the

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,890
way we do it is we go on

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:31,710
privileges to a user so whether he has a

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,890
right to select right to delete and

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,220
update okay so it's not owned by anybody

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:41,610
so tonight when we delete that user that

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,130
database is still you know accessible to

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:52,800
other right we also have a concept of

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:56,400
role that we can assign to user okay so

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,490
how do you connect to a database right

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,130
in Oracle we use sequel plus and then

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:06,090
you can connect to the database in MySQL

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:09,690
we use a MySQL client like command line

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,870
right DBA like to use command line so we

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:16,590
use MySQL a client to connect to the

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,650
database so I can now just quickly show

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,650
you

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,370
Oh

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,960
it's in the file

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:43,269
so the BBA default EPA users route but

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:48,209
this book is not the same as your OS

00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:48,209
route but the same

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,410
okay so - P is the plot number usually

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,320
this is a default that use it to come

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:21,060
back to the database and then - marpie

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:23,310
is password okay so your loved ones

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,360
already to that database okay

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:39,320
now so we want to look at how many bases

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:42,389
in half so we have the you know the two

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,750
system catalog database called

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:49,500
information schema that contains data

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:52,019
describing database the metadata record

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,899
and then we have the performance schema

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:57,269
that keep track of you know the

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,230
different performance statistic of the

00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:05,540
table how many rows of data in the

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,540
database and then these are the usual

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,659
[Music]

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:23,899
Moscow is the system catalog so that's

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,899
how you use so MySQL to connect to

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:45,550
so explain this before we the typical

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:49,600
doesn't really open by anybody right we

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:53,680
create user to in the database and then

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,450
we go on the privileges to the user so

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,740
that they could you know operate on a

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,450
database update or delete from a

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,450
database all right

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:16,470
and for developers or people who just

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:21,940
want to play around with MySQL database

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:24,640
there is a UI tools that you can use to

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,660
work with the database call MySQL

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:33,070
workbench okay so is a GUI you can

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:39,180
download it's it's point and click

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:42,280
it is a my yeah it's very easy to use

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,640
point-and-click it doesn't require you

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,710
to know all this command at this time

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,650
right so you see the barrel show

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:57,030
database and so on so give you a quick

00:13:50,650 --> 00:14:02,050
start to learn database and for you

00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:05,860
currently using Microsoft sequel server

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:10,240
if you want to try to see whether you

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,670
can put some of the data into MySQL the

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,930
workbench actually have database

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:22,540
migration tools that you could use to

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:26,190
test out you know how do data how to

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:32,430
work with data in MySQL okay so you can

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,430
export data and then migrate into Moscow

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,270
okay

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,910
[Music]

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:45,029
busy but basically I just want to show

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:51,029
you the difference architecture between

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:54,610
Oracle and MySQL all right so we have

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:59,380
say my Oracle we have the system global

00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:03,339
event memory buffer and music the on

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:06,339
this structure how data organized under

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:10,080
this in this and then we have a set of a

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:15,310
server process that work with data right

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:17,260
except in connection writing data in the

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,620
memory and making sure they does get

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,330
flash to do this and this is very

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:30,790
similar to MySQL so we also have a

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:33,730
memory for us to cache data after you

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,180
know we we need from the disk so this is

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,670
for fast access so that we don't have to

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,220
go to the disk all the time because

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:46,540
meaning from this is very expensive

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:53,560
ok so we use memory to catch some other

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:57,610
data and in that this we have the rock

00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,880
file to record changes in the

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,270
transaction look record we do similar to

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:12,360
Oracle there's a return lock to keep

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:17,350
transaction in case database die uses to

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:20,680
rollback or go for that transaction does

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,160
evil committed unknown committed to the

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:31,020
bill so that we can bring consistency

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:33,600
back to the database okay

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:39,440
so at this point you understand a little

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:42,960
bit about MySQL how do you install MySQL

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:48,500
alright so you can either download from

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:53,400
our website www.marriageguy.com

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:56,190
depending on the different system that

00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:01,650
you go on whether is Windows or Linux

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:06,870
and a different package installation you

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:13,130
could use yum install or RPM or apt

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:18,089
like a do tar to extract you know cobble

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:20,959
from the download into a directory of

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:25,230
your choice okay

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:29,310
usually we recommend people to use the

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,890
tar double-planet if you want to deploy

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:35,730
for production use our serious

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,580
production enterprise deployment couple

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:41,970
reason number one is that you have more

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,850
control flexibilities of no Santa

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,100
because you can create your own

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,910
directory you can structure your

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,560
filesystem according to your this

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:57,680
structure okay

00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:02,790
well as the rest of the method the

00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:05,970
structure of the data that the files the

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:08,610
file system is pretty much fixed right

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,820
there's a default area that we keep the

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,800
configuration file and also default for

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:18,210
us to restore the log files so if you

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:24,960
want more flexibility

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:29,390
tarah is the way to go alright okay so

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,220
everybody knows MySQL is open source

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:35,190
Oracle we own the source code

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,700
so essentially you could use it for free

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:44,340
we have a community edition which you

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:45,030
can download and then use it for your

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,570
own

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:52,950
project or the company whatever

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:56,460
application all right we also have a

00:18:52,950 --> 00:19:00,450
commercial edition where you want to

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:04,050
deploy for enterprise use for company

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,540
who want to have somebody to support

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:10,050
them right in case they run into

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:16,350
problems so we have a commercial edition

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:19,080
if you want to consider enterprise

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:24,800
capability such as backup and so on

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:29,220
right so these are the enterprise

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:33,710
capabilities that we put together in the

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:38,160
enterprise version so this is a

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,500
subscription-based type of license where

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:46,200
you subscribe journey and then you

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:50,730
entitle for bug fixes new features that

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:57,290
you can download from our web to

00:19:50,730 --> 00:20:03,210
continue improve database is database

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:06,150
capabilities however you know you're

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,430
afraid to use the database if you don't

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,710
need that kind of you know features I'm

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:14,910
gonna go through Josefin so that you

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,190
have a view of what it's not in the

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:21,960
community edition which you can consider

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:25,850
in the future if doesn't needs right so

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:31,380
we have high availability features

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:34,740
security encryption and also monitoring

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,400
tools for you to monitor the database

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:43,980
how well it performs and important is

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:47,100
the support that we provide you to you

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,280
in case you run into serious problem

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,890
where your data is corrupted you know

00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,140
database crash that you have somebody to

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:59,480
guide you through how to recover from

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:02,490
those serious issues

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:07,470
so just always summarize these are the

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:11,160
key capabilities of a part of our

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:14,390
commercial license application your

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,930
encryption also the firewall that

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:24,330
protect your database and we've altered

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:27,720
to audit one of activities based on user

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:30,060
are going to a database and we have a

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,420
monitoring tools for you to monitor your

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:36,960
math skills and very important is this

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:41,100
backup truth which allows you to not

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,850
only quickly execute the backup quickly

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:48,990
but also to restore reliably you know in

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:52,730
case there's a corruption data in the

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:56,190
database last but not least is the

00:21:52,730 --> 00:22:01,260
encryptions of your data so in the

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:07,080
community version data is kept as text

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:12,990
in the file system on the end of this so

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:15,960
if you have you keep sensitive data it

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,380
is good to have this capability to

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:23,510
encrypt the data so that even though the

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:28,290
data that the fire was stolen from the

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:31,800
system people can look into your because

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,990
or encrypt the data just garbage right

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,030
because you don't have the key to and

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:42,260
decrypt it to make sense over the data

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:48,210
okay so if you work with the MySQL which

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:51,720
eventually you go into designing high

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:56,130
ability solution for masc there a couple

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:59,520
of capabilities that you will use one is

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:05,040
replication that you can make a copy of

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:08,640
your data and then store it somewhere in

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,670
another server and spec up or for skill

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,240
out kind of purpose

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:19,020
for example if you have a main site

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:22,020
having say 1,000 user and you can have

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:26,340
another server have a separate copy of

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,530
your service to serve other setup user

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,840
right so if you have reporting

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:34,290
requirement you can have a replicator

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,200
database for reporting purposes so

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:42,390
usually people use that to protect for

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:53,640
that scale out variability requirement

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:57,300
right okay so I was gonna talk a bit

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,550
more on this cluster solution that we

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,980
have so I'm not going to go into more

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:05,580
detail by essentially want to tell you

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:10,050
is that in the cluster environment we

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:13,760
are three redundant MySQL server that

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:18,560
form cluster and then we have a router

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:23,870
to route application to the active

00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:27,090
primary server using whichever connector

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:32,690
that type to the application right and

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:36,180
we have a MySQL shell to manage and

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:39,210
configure your clusters and we have

00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:45,180
mascara enterprise monitor to monitor

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:52,760
the health of your cluster okay so back

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:58,440
up important community edition

00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:03,660
there's Maya Skelton nativities which

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:06,990
allows you to do a database export it's

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:10,590
not really a enterprise great backup

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:14,220
tools essentially just no dumping out

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:17,570
work data from your database into a file

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,670
which you can recreate later on if you

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:23,480
want to restore your database so for

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,660
enterprise use if you are familiar

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,960
right does it are men that does that for

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:35,300
you

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:38,240
so it back up the the database files so

00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:42,230
you can see a benchmark of it it is if

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,900
you use master Tom on a 2073 keep

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,810
database you take you four hours just to

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,300
extract the data into a file and well as

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:54,260
you use Enterprise backup it takes you a

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,940
couple of minutes and that's not the

00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,140
most important of all the most important

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:02,090
for is the time you takes to restore the

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,820
database because when database is

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,750
corrupted and everybody is screaming for

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,400
data in in your production server you

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,550
want to make sure that the restore work

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,660
very very reliably and fast so that you

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:25,520
can bring the database online quickly

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:28,130
not using the MySQL 18 hours right okay

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,800
so the other is transparent data

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,690
encryption we call it transparent data

00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,630
encryption is that it doesn't require

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:39,160
you know the application to do anything

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:43,160
to encrypt the data because the data is

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,930
encrypted automatically by Moscow and

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:50,600
then you select or read data from MySQL

00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,400
that data will be decrypted before

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,820
sending to you so you don't have to do

00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:01,010
anything in your application PHP or

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:06,250
JavaScript to to pay for take advantage

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:09,620
of these features okay five important

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:12,590
nowadays we have a lot of you know

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,630
hackings kind of activities and you know

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:18,650
SQL injection is one of the popular one

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:21,110
so if you have firewall you can block

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:27,320
those SQL injection kind of attempt to

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:31,810
try to steal your data right audit you

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:35,530
can enable to record activities of user

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,530
accessing your database

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:48,210
so to summarize just to recap is that

00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:52,380
mascara is very popular is it very easy

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:56,670
for you to get started download install

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:59,970
and not only that mascara it's very

00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:03,810
scalable right to web scale or to mobile

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:08,550
application or any type of you know

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:11,490
languages that use and if you know the

00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:17,150
our Enterprise Edition

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:22,020
you can't deploy reliably for enterprise

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:26,520
alright so that's all I want to talk

00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:35,700
about as introductory for you any

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:59,730
question that you have me me me let me

00:28:35,700 --> 00:29:02,820
come to Alabama have yeah father for it

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:08,610
can have the fat you you

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:15,810
modern comic commercial version because

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:19,100
if if the web app for the commercial is

00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:27,150
have quite slow for the

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:31,800
database to so another another data data

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:41,970
where to the website is it had a fast

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:46,140
more or the same yes yes

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:49,140
your question yes how does it compare if

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,840
I mean the commodity versions compare it

00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,500
the commercial editions regarding to

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,400
performance your questions okay

00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,610
so performance 101 is you know the

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,730
performance okay where the bottleneck is

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,850
then you can fix and if you don't know

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:12,510
then it's just really dark and then you

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:16,830
can effects so to understand that

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:20,700
correctly first the server we have the

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:23,310
monitor that you can dive in and that

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:27,450
you can show what it is happening and

00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:31,260
then fix regarding the seeker statement

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,670
and as well as some lump lancers so it

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:37,050
will tell you so in terms of performance

00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:40,950
one is actually all people get involve

00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,260
and the system can notify we're aware

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,900
the trap and the performance okay

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,090
problem s and the second thing is like

00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,420
the backup performance which the

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,810
commercial editions can offer a much

00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:57,540
better way of doing things so I hope

00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:01,320
this actually gives you the idea so the

00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:04,350
commercial editions can build a better

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,400
performance system and on the other hand

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,520
a developer's worried about the

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,940
developments of the projects on

00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:21,090
functionality functionality but whereas

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:24,650
when a big corporations company so the

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:27,480
concern is not purely the so-called

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:31,980
development and also functionality is

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:35,760
how to employ how to with the so called

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,910
data so they need their servers to be

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,580
always up they need the data is to be

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,990
always protected they need the data to

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:48,780
be managed and monitors correctly so

00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:53,040
commercially people look at this can be

00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:55,770
a lot more than just the developers so

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,410
that's why you can see why

00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:03,270
we need to build a community additions

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:06,120
to promote everyone to create light

00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:09,660
alarm and people can still develop a lot

00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:13,650
of things on my SQL why we have the

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:17,930
framework PHP framework Java framework

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:21,600
okay no js' favorite they all work with

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:26,130
MySQL because it's really developed and

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:31,410
freely to use but big corporations they

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:34,410
don't want to manage by hand melody they

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,500
