Title: The critical importance of use-neutrality in F OSS licensing - Roland Turner
Publication date: 2020-04-02
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Compliance & Legal
Description: 
	Free Software licensing strengthens human freedom by preventing software developers from exerting control over what software users do with their own property. Open Source licensing facilitates extremely broad and efficient co-operation in software development, including by people who are direct competitors or have conflicting value systems. Embedding software-use restrictions into F/OSS licenses in order to advance a specific commercial interest or ethical perspective is understandable, but is entirely incompatible with both F/OSS licensing approaches.
