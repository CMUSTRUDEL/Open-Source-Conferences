Title: The critical importance of use-neutrality in F OSS licensing - Roland Turner
Publication date: 2020-04-02
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Compliance & Legal
Description: 
	Free Software licensing strengthens human freedom by preventing software developers from exerting control over what software users do with their own property. Open Source licensing facilitates extremely broad and efficient co-operation in software development, including by people who are direct competitors or have conflicting value systems. Embedding software-use restrictions into F/OSS licenses in order to advance a specific commercial interest or ethical perspective is understandable, but is entirely incompatible with both F/OSS licensing approaches.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,839
well good afternoon and welcome back so

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,450
we're talking to you about why it's

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,950
important that free and open source

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,540
licenses are neutral on the question of

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,310
what purpose they're used for what

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,160
purpose the software is used for the

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,539
reason for doing this is that there was

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,720
late last year yet another resurgence of

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,070
conversation about the idea that open

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,450
source free and open source licenses

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,680
should be improved by rolling in terms

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,640
about the ethical use of the software

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,059
constraining the user constraining the

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,800
license on an obligation or under

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,329
thinking by the user to operate under

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,850
certain ethical principles there are

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,949
various options but the that's the broad

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,149
picture so it occurred to me that it

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,050
might be appropriate to address this

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,690
because it doesn't get talked about much

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,829
and most of it has been forgotten about

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,760
it was discussions that happened 20

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,250
years ago and so part of it also is just

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,140
our origins and remembering who we are

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,770
and what we're about the grandfather for

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,820
all of this is the free software

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,350
foundation as freedom 0 so named

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,000
actually because of the zeroth law of

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,330
thermodynamics the idea that the most

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,409
fundamental freedom that's embedded in

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,610
software is the freedom to use the

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,570
program these software freedoms the FSF

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,130
propagates there are four of them

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,409
weren't going as details with but like

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,520
the baseline is the ability to use the

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:44,100
programs you can't then what's the point

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,930
the rationale for this this is storm of

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,759
life as if is that every non free

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,159
program has a Lord her master and if you

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,259
used the program he is your master this

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,450
is the rationale for the Gounod project

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,149
the free Safin foundation copy the f

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,060
licensing the f in the in the name of

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,520
floss Asia this is what it's about the

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,509
fact that unless licenses are

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,550
constructed and less software is

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,530
constructed so that developers do not

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,840
control users

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,090
they're never ibly a power imbalance

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,240
arises and developers will control users

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,410
so it's in fact the point of free

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,060
software to say it is not okay for

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,770
developer to decide what our user can do

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,959
other than to decide to use or not use

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,040
the software but the point was to create

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:39,930
a body of software licensed in this way

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:41,270
hello you may end up so the freeze awful

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,050
foundation is sort of Philly

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:47,820
unapologetically about human rights and

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,400
isn't shy about saying so this puts a

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,650
lot of people off and in the 90s bruce

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,600
perens and others realized that there

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,850
was scope for the use of open-source

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,750
software or free software at the time in

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,180
a for-profit context but maybe we could

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,860
brand it a bit better bit better to stop

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,230
scurrying corporate types away from talk

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,010
about human rights and domination and

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,900
lords and so parents wrote the Debian

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,170
free software guidelines this was the

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,810
definition that the Davian organization

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,150
would adhere to in deciding what

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,140
licenses it would permit on software

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,410
that made up part of the Debian

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,299
distribution so this is where this thing

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,480
really starts to become embedded in the

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,820
systems that we now use and so the

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,709
Debian group established general of in

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,750
term definition and then said about

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,850
routing out of the Debian distribution

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,940
anything which had a license that didn't

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,720
meet these rules the same almost the

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,030
same rules made their way into the open

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,290
source initiatives definition said okay

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,690
let's do this but do it with the

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,220
corporate branding but the wording and

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:04,739
explanation are almost identical the way

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,780
this was addressed was not that the use

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,100
was free to do anything but rather a

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,600
positive look at it but a rather stating

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,100
explicitly the license must not

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,530
discriminate against a person or group

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,810
and separately that it must not

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,190
discriminate against any field of

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,350
endeavor in the sort of hot-button

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,690
example that was offered at the time

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,860
was genetic research particular for the

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:34,310
genetic modification of food so these

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,370
were ideas that were present not as part

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,000
of a program to enshrine human freedom

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,650
which is what the Free Software

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,370
Foundation was about but as part of a

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,910
campaign to make the idea of using

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,830
software where the source code was

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,430
available to everyone as part of how

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,780
corporations would do business and that

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,540
meant providing the groundwork for a

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,590
very open method of collaboration well

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,130
come back to that later we'll talk about

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,400
kosis penguin but that is critical that

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,180
first and foremost while free software

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,560
is about the freedom of individuals

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,330
open-source is about an open

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,470
collaboration technique so okay you

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,000
might have heard a little thought well

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,680
that's great but I want to decide you

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,710
who gets use my work or what they use it

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,870
for I really don't like the modern

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,880
example of ladies ice putting children

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,020
and babies in cages

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,210
there are various other things you might

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,550
object to but so you left with this but

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,950
hey you know I want to decide I am

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,350
contributing and I should have ever

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,190
saying that well okay it's it's your

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,990
code you break the rules

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,760
top owls famously pointed it out about

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,320
the Linux kernel yes

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,780
Windell you like but he wrote the

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,640
initial kernel and put a go GPL lessons

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:52,760
on it if you don't like that then don't

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:55,700
use it so fine let's look at how this

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,970
plays out and certainly in the the

00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,970
reasons

00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,189
you

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:36,050
okay so all right this sounds like good

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,130
stuff these two a great documents the

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,060
stuff with them is good we all think

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:43,820
they're excellent why shouldn't the

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,200
license include these as us-- limits and

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,550
forget the enforcement mechanism it's

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,030
more complicated but but just the

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,180
principle of having these two documents

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,230
embedded as they use limits is awful why

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,630
is that a problem

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,970
can't we do that obviously we can all

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:04,850
agree that these are good things okay

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:08,900
let's look at it UDHR is 30-something

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:11,990
articles here are two of them yeah 1948

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,920
this is the next problem because so part

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,630
of the argument and I'll get in that

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,220
mode

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:20,950
this is immediately after post after

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,300
World War two where a particular

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,550
approach to through the relationship

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,710
between an individual and the state had

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,690
gotten a bit out of control attempted to

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,270
destroy an entire ethnic group like

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,950
literally physically kill them and as a

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,530
side effect had killed like 10 15

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,020
million people so yeah everyone was like

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,160
this this hasn't worked let's let's

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:46,520
think differently I'll get to why that's

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,530
also a bit later the point here is just

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,370
here two articles I'm drawing these out

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,990
because this is an area that I work in

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,610
no one shall be subjected to public

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,520
interference with his privacy his

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,720
correspondence no attacks on reputation

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,330
and petitions of law for those things

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,370
and rights of hidden to expression to

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,440
hold opinions without interference to

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:11,720
seek receive impart information through

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,370
any medium and so forth so okay so far

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,240
so good

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,680
hopefully we're all okay with these

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,420
these seems like good things that should

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,180
be okay and how could it possibly be a

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,040
bad idea to embed these because this is

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,690
the actual text that's being

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,660
incorporated by reference into the

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,550
hippocratic license part of it how could

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,550
that possibly be a bad idea

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,690
well the first thing is in fact the

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,979
point that Evan uttered this is written

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,700
in 1948 first enforceable laws didn't

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:46,010
appear from

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:49,640
20 years it's the gap between agreeing a

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,600
set of principles and documenting a law

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,690
that's enforceable is enormous it's not

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,820
it's not a simple thing at all but worse

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,490
than that these were single state laws

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,020
within Germany and they dealt with

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,580
specific pieces of processing to be fair

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,140
all about data processing wasn't pretty

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,250
advanced at this stage so perhaps the

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,600
the limited form of the risk was a

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,250
reason part of the reason for the delay

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,430
but it's not as though the rest of the

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,540
UDHR got itself rolled into every piece

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:23,350
of law worldwide a great deal faster um

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,520
another 25 years goes by and finally the

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:29,090
European Commission in Parliament issue

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,530
a directive in 995 which runs to about

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:38,200
12,000 words and all it does is turns

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:40,820
those two paragraphs into actionable law

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,110
it's a 12,000 word document which took

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,700
almost half a century to appear 20 years

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,450
of experience of that gave rise to GD P

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,140
R which we all know and love which is

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:56,270
more than four times the size of that

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,130
being capable of determining whether a

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,450
particular action complies with the GD P

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:05,450
R is difficult it's worthwhile it's a

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,800
fantastic piece of law a major proponent

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,930
of this thing but to say yes in order to

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,970
meet the terms of a license which

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,520
invades EHR you are necessarily

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,980
embedding some sort of embodiment in

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,450
workable law and we're now talking self

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,520
that runs dozens of pages and needs

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,120
professionals to interpret so it's not

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
feasible

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,840
you can't an individual program or even

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,430
in some cases a mid-sized organization

00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,280
came up look at a bit of software and

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,590
say yes we do or no we don't comply with

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,890
everything in the UDHR under every

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,380
conceivable interpretation come back to

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,880
ofa yes that's my next my next point and

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,640
for this reason it's the right it's

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,570
completely the wrong tool for the job

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,770
Human Rights principles and possible

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,810
laws and force of regulations and

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,390
contract or license terms are for quite

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,030
different things they're intended for

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,650
use in quite different situations

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,420
most importantly the human rights

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,980
principles were intended as a starting

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,050
point for creating enforceable laws and

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,630
regulations they're in terrible

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,270
situations where human lives are being

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,520
seriously harmed where they're being

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,680
harmed by states who have the right to

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,510
use force to enforce their will and

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,450
where the stakes are high honor that

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,100
therefore courts are involved case by

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,350
case to determine what is and isn't the

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,530
law it's just isn't simple to determine

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,370
it's not because the one or both parties

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,780
are being dishonest

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,800
it's simply difficult to determine

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,120
whether a particular act is or is not

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,210
combat compatible with the intention of

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,560
the of the principles that alone so I

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,660
thought the regulation let alone laws

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:42,050
and principles and so these things are

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,900
extraordinarily inappropriate for moving

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,100
from the law relating to states which is

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,230
where the user forces involved in the

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,360
full cost review into the laws of

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,410
private contract and particularly for

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,670
open source communities where the

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,730
decisions are made at a very low level

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,520
and very low stakes where nobody can

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,190
afford a panel of lawyers to determine

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,380
the consequences of incorporating the

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:08,810
entire gamut of human rights into a

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:10,880
license agreement so okay you're not

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,590
convinced you think that's fine

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,900
we still think these are such good

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,240
things as we put in and in cases where

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,170
we can definitely prove that someone has

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,580
breached then it'd be a good thing to

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,170
have that because they're all good we

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,170
cannot possibly object to them can we

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,740
pretty well every person in this room

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,330
draws somewhere all their income from a

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,500
company whose business is automating

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,600
something that used to take more human

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,400
beings under one interpretation every

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,460
single one of us makes a living out of

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,720
breaching article 23 we are in PD the

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,460
ability of our human being so in a

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,470
living now

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,900
hopefully no Anna's room would think

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,740
that that was a bad thing that over time

00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,970
were all reasonably convinced that you

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,670
human beings adapt and the available

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,140
labor adapts to the available demand and

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,730
people learn things and the bomb goes

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,580
away but certainly the ones have

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,900
interpretations what it is most of our

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,030
livings doing

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,590
breaches this article so if we're

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:11,040
starting to embed this particular set of

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,440
ideas as principles into licenses we're

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:19,470
now creating minefields for ourselves

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:22,020
for employers for our customers so what

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:26,730
I'm suggesting is that these are sort of

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:30,900
well-intentioned attempts to impede bad

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,910
people like here's a thing that is being

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,030
made use of to advance some interest

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,650
that the recent one was Pais putting

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,840
babies in cages

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,930
he's a thing where we could exert some

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:47,370
control therefore we must it's like this

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,570
is not that that conclusion doesn't hold

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,790
yes

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:54,570
sticking babies in cages this is is

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,130
appalling the use of human rights

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,080
principles in open source licensing is

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:03,930
just not a good tools a bad fit for

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:05,580
licensing but also even if you buy the

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,130
rest of what I said it's not compatible

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,270
with false communities I'll touch this

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,130
again at the coasters penguin section

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,870
but false communities in particular are

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,960
diverse people who have conflicting

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,740
rights converting interests and often

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,230
don't like each other very much we

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:26,360
succeed in spite of that we succeed

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:29,100
because we're able to facilitate

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,510
collaborative work by extremely diverse

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,490
groups of people and groups of people

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,100
who in many cases are either direct

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,260
commercial competitors think the phone

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,190
manufacturers and the GPU manufacturers

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,350
who contribute on the Linux kernel they

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:47,190
work directly with their competitors and

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,590
yet they cooperate certainly who despise

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,420
each other there's all any number of

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:55,140
places where some subset of the

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,860
developers or users of an open-source

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,170
tool doesn't much like the others but

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,410
perhaps most critically it's unlikely to

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:07,230
stop the bad guys for a number of

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:11,820
reasons the bad guys are human rights

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,680
abusers in the Middle East where human

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,540
rights law has no effect at all and any

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,320
event the licenses who are upset about

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,610
it

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,900
likely to be able to endure they have

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,070
standing to bring an action in front of

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:27,180
a court perhaps closer to home certainly

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:30,480
us the such licenses could be under one

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,390
interpretation voided completely by

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,130
simply outsourcing okay ice can't be the

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,510
licensee but in any event they can do

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,300
outsource their IT functions the IT guys

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,940
could be the licensees boom you've

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,010
achieved literally nothing but okay

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,800
suppose both of those are true that

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:49,740
sorry but they're both unavailable that

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,260
we have an actual male factor so on we

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,550
all agree is bad who's inside a

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,000
jurisdiction who is subject to being

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,770
sued and so this is not impossible the

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,740
pressure fermentation has repeatedly

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:07,350
successfully gotten licensed abusers to

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,340
to come clean famously Cisco with the

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,340
Linksys firmware but there are

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,740
apparently dozens of others okay so

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,720
let's say well that's you know we're at

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,040
the point where we really could halt in

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,520
front of a judge and get the problem

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,800
solved

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,910
what's the solution fine stop using up a

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,640
source component and go and pay for a

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,890
close one at which point we've royally

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,240
shot ourselves in the foot the last

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,280
thing we want to do is divert money for

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
making our reactors out of the pockets

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,120
of open-source developers working for

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,170
companies that develop and share it into

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,600
the pockets of open-source developers

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:44,190
who work for companies that don't this

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,310
is not it we failed to understand that

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,430
the the organization that was seeking to

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,900
control isn't going to be controlled if

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,010
they can't cooperate with you then they

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,480
will compete with you okay success so

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,780
that's that's all of the other part of

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,800
the the argument is that we we all

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,110
benefit from the work of people but we

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,780
profoundly disagree with it in some

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,560
cases we even despise and this might be

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,360
familiar to those who've studied

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,520
political science this of course is

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,650
exactly what goes on in representative

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,870
politics in a parliament or Congress

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:20,850
this is precisely the deal

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,910
no one says hey perhaps not entirely

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,880
true

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,680
in a civilized society no one says hey

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,440
we don't like you we want to make sure

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,550
you don't get to participate you don't

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,510
get to work you don't get to earn you

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:37,900
don't get to vote you don't get do

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:40,090
anything I'm going to eat so it's not as

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,230
though there is a lack of precedent in

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,300
civilized society for people who

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,940
disagree profoundly or even who despise

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,280
each other - nonetheless cooperate and

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,130
I'd suggest that that's this area that

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,660
we that we profit in and indeed this is

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,100
pro-social one of the arguments is hey

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,320
they're doing something antisocial we

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,170
should you know exclude that from the

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,370
license no it is the ability to

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,340
cooperate with people that we don't like

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,960
and don't know anti-family

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:11,490
easy in fact the basis for civilized

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:16,720
behavior but I don't like those people

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:18,850
so okay no I don't like that bad people

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,620
will do bad things with software

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,260
condemned to do so this is the broad

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,370
social control problem at least if

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,250
you're honest about it is if you're not

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,980
if all you're saying is I don't care

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,480
that they're doing those things I just

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,700
don't want anything I worked on to be

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,840
seemed to be helping them then you're

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,010
admitting that you actually don't care

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,300
about the things you claim to care about

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,440
you're only care about your own

00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,360
reputation so that's the virtue

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,750
signaling half let's assume that's not

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,640
the case this then becomes a social

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,100
control question how does a society

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,800
ensure that a variety of bad things

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,210
don't happen and laws and regulations

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
are by no means the only way of doing it

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,350
they're not even the major way of doing

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,550
it custom particular civility the fact

00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,710
that we don't routinely beat each other

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,650
in the streets is a much much larger

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,480
piece of the puzzle and part of that is

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,990
remaining civil around people that we

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,450
don't like religion is a surprisingly

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,730
important one and although this might

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,740
seem remote to what we all do for a

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:18,880
living the Vatican recently published a

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:22,630
specific call for ethics in the use of

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,460
AI news organizations are getting

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,170
directly involved and I am fact although

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm not a religious man and have all

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,020
kinds of problems of what religion does

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,420
and has done I would argue that

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,710
religions do have a direct part to play

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,920
in helping to shape

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,220
the norms of a society hopefully mostly

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,970
for the better professional ethics is

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,950
hugely important if you're doctors

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,660
lawyers a bunch of other people who are

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,030
taking on a responsibility where the

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,590
customer has to trust them and so you

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,540
establish a professional obligation for

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,900
the professional to be more loyal to the

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,920
customer than to themselves this is not

00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,540
necessarily a solution of the problem

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,870
but it's a way of one of the ways

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,980
society solved the problem that I don't

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,620
like the fact that that guy over there

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,510
is doing a bad thing so one of the ways

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,400
to do that is progression to establish

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,610
effectively a guild and to kick out

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,050
anyone who abuses similar labor unions

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,660
they're not quite the same thing that

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,160
the analysis is different but again it's

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,970
about there are other ways of

00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,680
establishing behavioral norms in society

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,290
then embedding everything in in

00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,120
contracts and although you might argue

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,310
this should be done as well as I hope

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,050
I've ot make clear there are real

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,030
problems with trying to omit human

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,170
rights principles into context generally

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:42,770
and to software licenses in particular

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,910
there's also a process abuse risk we see

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,460
this occasionally with codes of conduct

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,900
so I will state sew it up I'm actually

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,510
perfectly happy with codes of conduct I

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,070
think the the level of civility in the

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,330
balloon external environment for example

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,040
has gone up drastically in the last few

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,280
years is a major achievement and one

00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,310
that I think should be seen that way but

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,990
of course some of the same people who

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,820
are pushing for ethical sauce are

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,400
pushing for codes of contact which seem

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,270
to be used primarily to exclude people

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,710
that they don't like and so that's

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,420
problematic at the level of a project

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,710
team but I'd suggest that a code of

00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,390
conduct does make sense at the level

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,220
project team and then the team has to

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,450
keep an eye on whether the code has been

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,390
constructed in a way that facilitates

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,340
abuse and whether it is being abused at

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,420
the much broader level of the supply

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,940
chain so software which I get to in a

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,160
moment I'd suggest that's that risk

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,800
can't be contained that's it's a again a

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,530
harmful thing to do the other thing that

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,940
I suspect might be going on in the we

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,330
want to stop putting babies in cages

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,610
case is at least in the US there's a

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,770
significantly lower standard of proof

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,630
for civil laws of a criminal law so by

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,310
embedding all this will the stuff

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,750
into license terms which is harmful for

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,100
all the reasons I've just described in

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,110
which Reche visiting nothing for the

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,090
reasons I've just described what it will

00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:01,340
do is allow vexatious litigation it

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,410
allow someone to simply use the courts

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,090
as a weapon now whether with that maybe

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,170
basis for hey we've got this thing that

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,310
we dragged in is an argument that what

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,240
you're doing which is human rights which

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,310
is have just product cover just about

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,450
everybody so now you can if you want to

00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,940
hurt them you just hold on front of the

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,220
court and either you step away in which

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,570
case the court takes money from you or

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,780
you engage in which case the lawyers

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,730
take money from you so it's a means of

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,830
bullying people so that's and I think

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,320
that I suspect that that's part of the

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,660
what's going on in the current surge or

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:35,600
can't recent pressures for ethical

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:39,830
licensing so ok look at the long supply

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,450
chain maybe you struct construct the

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,910
lessons in such a ways to escape the

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,280
outsourcing risk that I mentioned one of

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:49,190
the ways the bad guys could be out of

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,160
reach of your theoretical ethical

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,830
license is to outsource so ok you can

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,700
stuck license terms to survive

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,220
outsourcing relationships I wouldn't

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,180
bore you with the details but you can at

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,260
least in theory do such a thing so right

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,510
we working a project team on some

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,160
library we have a code of conduct that's

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,230
appropriate for use inside the team and

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,170
it's being used in a hopefully inclusive

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,270
rather than exclusive way

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,040
however the component is a dependency of

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,440
a bunch of other things there might be

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,900
entire trees these dependencies but

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,720
ultimately of an application the

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,770
application is a monitoring system

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,180
ticketing system any variety of things

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:33,220
embedded somewhere in an infrastructure

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:36,440
or platform as a service cloud the

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,580
Amazon Web Services Rackspace all those

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,710
guys use a bunch of open source software

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:44,990
internally a random small tube in size

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,840
organization or startup produces ace

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,580
software's a service which they of

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,870
course host in this environment and they

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,370
make it available to their customers who

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,480
subscribe who then have their employees

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:59,010
use it but the employer uses it to do

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
something that is unethical

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,150
and we have constructed our license

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,290
terms theoretically to survive all of

00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:10,110
these indirect steps in the relationship

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:13,530
so now what has to happen for this

00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,500
solution to work what has to happen is

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:19,590
that at every one of these steps but in

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,640
particular at the two subscription steps

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:27,110
the the is pass of the purse a skies has

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,910
to include the transitive closure of the

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,100
ethical use limitations so if there are

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,450
a hundred thousand components and they

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,760
have only five hundred different

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,870
licenses because of course every one of

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,020
these things is going to be specific

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:43,830
then you end up with this enormous list

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,350
of use limits so when you go to up to

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,950
sign up for Google Docs backs like G

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,720
suite Salesforce random SAS or the mouth

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,020
here the ten thousand things you don't

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,150
have to do no one's going to do that and

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,400
so again even if you solve the problem

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,790
of the the outsource loophole what you

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,400
do is destroy the economic driver for

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,410
collaboration by anyone who lives in any

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,270
of these chains they have to immediately

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,310
exclude what you're doing it's the same

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,900
as the problem with the viral good new

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,120
licenses in some cases and the affero

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,380
licenses in some cases but you now of

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,750
talking about a much larger and much

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,510
more complicated problem so it's it

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,860
can't ultimately solve the problem but

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,830
it rather doesn't work or does so much

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,450
harm that it prevents use another way to

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,980
now we're getting into sort of a grab

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,740
bag of ideas that I didn't quite get

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,680
into sequence so with that another way

00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,180
of getting why this is ridiculous

00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,540
would be this kind of license agreement

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:42,690
I imagine some people in this room own a

00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,120
screwdriver would it make any sense at

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,260
all for the purchase agreement for the

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,050
screwdriver to have included an

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,500
obligation not to breach the Universal

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,160
Declaration of Human Rights

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,850
hopefully it's really obvious that that

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,750
doesn't make any sense

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,930
I mentioned curses penguin so this is a

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:03,030
paper that came out sometime the 90s

00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,200
noticing that open-source communities

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,930
were doing something that's not

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,150
correctly predicted by the pre-existing

00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:11,130
models of collaborative production

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,820
either in the firm or the marketplace

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,470
for the firm

00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,470
is you grab a bunch of resources and you

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,850
hire employees but marketplace is you

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,800
grab branch of employee with resources

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,120
to work on a thing and you contract with

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,620
others to do some other part of what

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,790
you're doing and of course any real

00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,550
organization does some mixture of these

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,290
two and the economic theory had been

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,420
these are the two ways everything gets

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,180
done and neither of them sensibly

00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:38,000
explains what's going on in in free and

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:40,350
open-source communities in those two

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,400
older and better studied approaches

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,410
division helps within firms it provides

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,360
it's all that competition in fact both

00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,680
cases inside firms means that you simply

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,310
exclude people you don't like and you

00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,510
get a firm of people working with one

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,250
worldview the sort of Bro culture that

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,690
we keep seeing in Silicon Valley it has

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,150
side effects but certainly internally

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,490
it's very efficient in the marketplace

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,850
it promotes competition which promotes

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:10,410
more efficient and better products so

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,730
these sort of choosing a mechanism which

00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,500
tends to divide people is in fact a

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,840
valuable in these two cases but no

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,890
collaboration is not the last thing you

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,330
want to have is people who are

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,190
collaborating across organizational

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,470
boundaries across Geographic cultural

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,650
boundaries just stop putting lines in

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:30,180
saying no you can't talk to each other

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,010
so it's the point I'm making here simply

00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,970
that the idea of inserting ethical use

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:38,160
limits is unusually harmful in free and

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,890
open-source licensing in a way that

00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:45,960
would not be in certain kinds of

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:48,480
commercial licensing a bit snarky

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,970
perhaps but a lot of this is puritanical

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,040
and by and large you you should ignore

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,240
Puritans because they don't deliver if

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,520
you allow a project to get bogged down

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
in virtual signalling mainly what you do

00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,310
is take away its capacity to deliver so

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,980
again it's harmful this is no just open

00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:06,270
source this is everything finally of

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,710
course it begs the question okay suppose

00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,310
you're still hilburn from doing this

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:13,410
thing what would it look like how would

00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,610
you do it and one of the races because

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,080
there was recently an attempt to change

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,670
the

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,680
and I think this ongoing attempt to

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:23,580
change the open source definition

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,020
maintained by the open source initiative

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,150
to remove those two courses of the model

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,140
either two clauses I showed you earlier

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,250
and so part of it is well they're the

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,710
gunner project is too hard to repeat

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,230
what Stallman did is absolutely amazing

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,790
and very few developers have ever or

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,280
will ever do what he did he sat down

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,320
wrote a compiler and a shield and a text

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,760
header in a build system himself and

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,800
coupled the point where they were still

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,460
hosting on a commercial UNIX and that

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,910
was in that sort of the kernel the

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:55,130
little bit of the germ from which free

00:28:50,910 --> 00:29:00,810
system is involved but interestingly

00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:03,030
because the intent of the open source

00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,230
initiative was to make this method of

00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:08,970
the use and production of software more

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:11,750
attractive to corporations in addition

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,280
to removing the human freedom thinking

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,200
they also removed the requirement or

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,960
allowed the Pleasants not have the

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,640
requirement for the transit evolved

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,380
viral nature for licenses if you take a

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,940
work on the GPL you make a drive to work

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,750
you must make it about a lot of the same

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,130
terms that's not true from almost all

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,640
almost any of the other open-source

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,930
licenses so arresting lee if you were to

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,810
create an ethical sports program and a

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,160
project to create a sort of ethical

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,920
desktop with the license that had let's

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,100
say a UDHR embedded in it you could in

00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,510
fact pick up thousands of X of existing

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,050
packages under open source licenses and

00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:51,780
simply add restrictions and most of the

00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:54,210
open source licenses permit that so if

00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,710
this is more the answer to why the open

00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,290
source initiative should not change its

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,370
definition for the same reason the open

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,860
source initiative is a separate project

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,480
to the Free Software Foundation if

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,980
someone wants to do this the sense were

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,630
to do it is to start a new program and

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,670
because you now have this huge body of

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,780
open source software that has licenses

00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,810
that allow you to put further

00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:15,930
restrictions on derived works in fact

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,860
you've got the selling point merely

00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,970
poured out it's interesting that of

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,930
course you can't do that with free

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,270
software you cannot add restrictions it

00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,350
seems interesting that the subset of

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,750
open source software

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,190
that is targeted specifically at human

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,600
rights and freedoms is exactly the

00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,400
software that would not be compatible

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,870
with this strategy for creating an

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,580
ethical sorts program food for thought

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:41,460
so just close on a reminder of these two

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,220
ideas although it's off very actually

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,350
stated this way these are the two things

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,179
that force are about free software is

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,160
about protecting the rights of users of

00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,030
software that the developers don't gain

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,160
domination or control over them and

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,250
open-source is about sustaining the

00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,620
ability to cooperate across enormous

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:04,049
differences in time zone in geography

00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,140
and culture in ethics in commercial

00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:09,230
competition the whole model

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,230
thank you

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,090
