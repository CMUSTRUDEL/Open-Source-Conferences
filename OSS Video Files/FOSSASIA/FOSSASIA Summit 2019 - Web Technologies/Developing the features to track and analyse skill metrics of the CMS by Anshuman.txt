This talk is about how the analytical features of the CMS are implemented and thus talks about the different metrics provided by the CMS Web app. This also explains how the entire UI of the Web app was revamped for the powerful use of various filters that were implemented and the search functionality to easily search for the required skills.

This also gives an insight about the enhanced power to the skill creators about the rating their skill is receiving so they can improve it and correspondingly act according to the user feedback.
