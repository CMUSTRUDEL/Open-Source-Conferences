The talk will focus on the newly implemented user-role permission model of SUSI.AI which we have recently switched to from the former Wikipedia user-role permission model. I will discuss why we felt the necessity to switch to our own permission model, and what are the newly implemented user-roles and their specific features implemented on the Server side.

During my session, I'm hoping to clarify the different user-roles which we have implemented on SUSI.AI Server to facilitate various APIs to support the different SUSI.AI Clients. I will discuss about how these have been implemented on SUSI Server, and would also like to emphasise on the logic behind the decision to switch to our own permission model, and how it allows us to have a better administrative model.

SUSI.AI has various user-roles implemented on SUSI Server. The different user-roles of users of SUSI.AI affects their abilities to perform certain actions on various SUSI.AI Clients. I would like to go over each user-role and the various permissions associated with that particular user-role. I will also discuss several features which are available only for specific user-roles for demonstration purposes.

At the end, I'd also demonstrate how anyone can try out the different user-roles on their locally setup SUSI Server. I'd also motivate people to contribute to the SUSI.AI project.
