SUSI AI Web bot builder is a service I created as a part of my GSoC 2018 project. This allows the users to create SUSI.AI chatbots very easily. Basic theme settings and custom replies to specific user texts are currently allowed in this chatbot. Many other features like preview of the chatbot, saving its draft, allowing bot only on specific sites etc are in initial stage and many more features are yet to build. This bot builder is built using ReactJS

okay so I'm going to talk about Suzy AI

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,799
web BOTS so all of you must be familiar

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,719
with chat BOTS so let's start with an

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,500
introduction of myself so my name is the

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,139
gancho insane

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,089
okay I'm a full stack web developer I

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,100
have worked in front end web developing

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,949
using react gist and in backend of

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,140
developing using node.js and PHP okay

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm also an iOS developer and I was

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,029
student developer at Google Summer of

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,760
Code 2018 with force Asia okay so and

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,080
I'm the M jack is basically the computer

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,510
science club of my college I am a

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,520
cybersecurity sub coordinator in that I

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,610
am pursuing computer science and

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,370
engineering at IIT but now in India this

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,840
is my email my website my getup and my

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,230
Twitter in case you want to contact me

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
so let's start so we're going to start

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,980
with discussing what is the chatbots

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,289
because that needs to be clear so

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,690
according to Oxford it says that a child

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,610
what is a computer program designed to

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,469
simulate conversation with human users

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,449
especially over the internet so there

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,460
are two special keywords over here first

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,559
is it bits designed to simulate

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,180
conversation with human users okay so

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,799
basically chat bot is a program with

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,600
which you can talk this is basically

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,590
what it means and specially over the

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,210
Internet because like if it if you're

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,280
talking it with it offline then it's a

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,049
robot it's not a chat bot so chatting is

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,020
done online so that is why over the

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,210
internet now most of you must have seen

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,650
Facebook BOTS right Facebook boards or

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,869
kik BOTS or Twitter BOTS

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,329
now how do that those board work they

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,400
were using an api s-- so that is what I

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,380
have written here so let's let's talk

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,189
about now how does that API thing work

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,829
so you have your bot and what happens

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,170
like if you say how are you to that bot

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,090
you ask the question that question goes

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,970
to the service of the service let's say

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,360
the bot is on Facebook so it goes to the

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,280
servers of Facebook and then that

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,350
response is fetched for the for your

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,320
query and then it's sent back to you so

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,820
all of this is done using a PS the

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,009
request and the response so with

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,590
Facebook the most famous type of bots

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,630
are the fingers so like let's say I'm a

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,149
singer I have my songs then I can create

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,489
a chat board which the users would use

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,510
to listen to my songs they can say that

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,330
I want to hear

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,790
later song of your that you release in

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,610
2090 so that's what they can do also

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,099
games games game chat work can also be

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,750
created using Facebook API so the dad

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,330
what happens is that it their

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,280
role-playing game like a situation will

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,500
be given you will make a decision in the

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,019
next situation so all of this is done

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,970
using chat boards but you can also use

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,280
key K API to create take chat boards and

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,269
pitch pitches an online video streaming

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,980
gaming platform ok so let's move on okay

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,690
so now types of child words there are

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,879
basically three types of chat BOTS so

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,340
the first one is a support board support

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,140
board is built to master single domain

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,209
so it's a support but as the name

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,220
suggests it is there to provide your

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,660
support so if I'm providing your support

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,280
you don't need support for everything

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,200
right you need support for some specific

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,299
thing like if the chat board is on my

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,250
website on my website so you need

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,780
support for that website so the chat

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,640
would the chat board should basically

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,680
know everything about that website so

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,420
that is it it should be master of a

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,150
single domain example knowledge about a

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,519
company second thing it needs to have a

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,919
personality and context awareness now

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,169
this basically means that the wave in

00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,750
which the child bought talks or means

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,910
the chat bot replies needs to be similar

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,440
to the way that the that the companies

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,090
means let's say that the company is

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,950
really professional it's a very big

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,720
company so the chat board cannot talk in

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,900
a very frank way it needs to be

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,190
professional that is what it means the

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,680
third thing is it should be able to

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,370
answer wide range of FAQ type question

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,430
so I'm going to if I'm talking to a

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,290
support child what it means that I want

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,150
it I want help with something so I'm

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,430
either confused what I am really

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,310
frustrated so that is what this is for

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,230
so I will ask really difficult or really

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,720
weird question in a really weird way so

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,569
it should be able to answer FAQ is of a

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,190
wide range okay and the final thing is

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,049
yeah this is the final thing is really

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,269
important because I have given two

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,609
examples first is I want to sell X Y Zed

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,190
how do I add my account number and the

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,410
second query I sold X Y Z two days ago

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,269
and I cannot seem money in my account so

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,829
there are two keywords here sell and

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,630
sold chat but should be able to

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,190
differentiate between these two keyboard

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,349
that is really important so that it can

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,190
know this which type of response to show

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,290
to which type of

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,210
so this is the first type of chart board

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,070
the second is skills chat board this is

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,110
completely different from support chat

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,480
board so skills chat boards are

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,850
basically their master adds some

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,180
particular skills so they don't need to

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,160
be like a very broader case like the

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,500
support chat board they just need like

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,330
it says performing specific tasks or

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,240
specific commands so self-explanatory

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,460
since second is speech functionality is

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,320
preferred by the users okay so the

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,470
examples make makes it clear it says

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,660
turn of the lights of my bedroom I don't

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,280
necessarily want to type this to a chat

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,290
board so that's why speech is usually

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,790
preferred in this one and it needs the

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,710
hot word to start listening if there is

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,300
a speech functionality it means that I

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,150
want the chat board to start listening

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,450
at something at some word that I say

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,460
let's like them I apologize a CD so that

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,010
is a hot word assets in chat board so

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,270
these are the these come somewhere in

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,770
the middle between the skills chat

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,900
button the support chat board they

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,240
provide both type of things so Apple

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,130
Siri Google home Amazon Aleksic odana

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,780
all of these are assistant chat boards

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,680
away so these were the three kinds of

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,810
chat boards moving on now before we add

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,700
start chat boards to our website

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,220
something needs to be clear that why is

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,290
there a need for the for this okay so I

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,020
found this fact on the internet that by

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,610
2020 over 85 percent of consumer

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,340
interactions will be handled without a

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,730
human it's already 2019 and this set was

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,310
around four years old so their predict

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,410
you loss to that now okay so second is

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,330
thing is simultaneous processing of

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,550
multiple requests from users let's say

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,010
that I have a chart board over the web

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,290
and at a particular time 50,000

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,340
customers are there on my website which

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,100
needs some kind of help

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,540
so if I want to provide help to all of

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,880
them and I'm and I'm thinking about

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:19,590
providing help using a chat window so I

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,710
would so for that I need 50,000 people

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,690
in my call center who would be there on

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,850
the computer and they will help all the

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,890
customers so that is a lot of investment

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,370
I can easily escape all of that using a

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,630
chat pod because it can simultaneously

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,330
handle requests from all those users

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,240
okay and the third point is also that

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,639
only

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,580
the need for humans to like chat with

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,680
the users finally it provides a better

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,910
experience then FAQ and content from I

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,979
figure and contact form are usually

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,840
boring we don't read everything in

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:52,360
detail we just skipped or or just see

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,729
the keywords much more interesting thing

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,740
is to talk with the child were so they

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,960
provide assistance quickly and

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,669
efficiently okay the chat board can be

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,720
programmed to be entertaining okay every

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,729
cues cannot be programmed to be

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,819
entertaining but chat boards can be they

00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:09,630
can be small jogs around mother they can

00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:13,479
be small jokes with the answers okay

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:17,139
third thing is the gate uses they give

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,389
you this talk to it they gives the gate

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,940
sorry give us a chance to talk without

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,820
being judged so this is something that

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,789
most of the people who are who feel

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,120
complex in talking to phone on talking

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:34,120
on phone there this is what they face

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,039
like they would think that the person

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,990
I'm talking to he will think that I am

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,970
NOT like let's say I'm on a website I'm

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,970
not able to use at website and if I

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,169
contact a person and I tell him that I'm

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,120
not able to use his episode he would

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,710
probably think that he's too pretty

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,659
cannot use his website but chat but

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,639
would not think that so this is nothing

00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,699
and Chad was sparks curiosity of people

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,680
they'd love to explore its ability so

00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,270
important thing finally let's move to

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,370
Suzy a now that the basic things are

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,289
covered so the session before me both

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,270
also Susie yes but I think that most of

00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:07,090
you know already know but Susie a is all

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,190
about it's a personal assistant and open

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,639
source personal assistant okay so it has

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,289
a lot of functions that is this music

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,979
playback making to duel is setting a

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,630
steaming for podcast playing audio books

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,680
and cetera it also provide weather in

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,479
traffic information and other

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:28,870
information all of this information is

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:31,659
provided using AP ice okay now so I

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,729
built this Susie a web board during my

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,610
g-shock period so when the that time

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,440
started we didn't have this chat box on

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,719
the Susie so we had this idea that a

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,909
born chat BOTS and we warned them that

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,100
the chat board should use Susie as the

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,050
person who will reply to the user

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,279
queries so we needed some idea like how

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,920
do we start with this

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,589
like how Susie box is basically

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,230
like there are skills okay so if I have

00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,639
if I have a query so the response for

00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,350
that query will be written in the skill

00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,730
so the response is fed from the skill

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,220
and then it is displayed to the user

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,350
there is how basically Susie books okay

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,329
so and all the skills are public so I

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,730
needed some way for those skills to be

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,589
private because I think about it this

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,660
way all the skills are public so you can

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:16,000
see all the skills like if if the

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,350
response for hi is hello I'm Susie so

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,269
everyone will be able to know the

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,589
response for hi is hello I'm Susie but

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,399
let's say that I am the owner of a

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,110
company and I won't the replied to hi to

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,470
be hello hi are doing welcome to our

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,209
website

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,740
I want this response and I don't want

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:32,620
anyone else to know about it because it

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,940
is of my own chat board so we need that

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,350
type of thing that the skills should be

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,750
private there was our first main

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,190
challenge okay so Susie replies to user

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,010
query on the basis of Susie skills

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,110
that's just when I told a skill defines

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,029
how a particular query or a type of

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,470
query should be answered so I said a

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:52,360
particular query because you can just

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,399
type in the query you can just hard code

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,339
the responses for the Quay and also type

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,870
of query because you can also do a pair

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,430
calls with your with the quays whatever

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,040
the queries of the users are you can do

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,660
API call like if there if you're trying

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,490
to fetch weather information then we

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,040
cannot hard code weather information so

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,600
it will be using an API call for Chad

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,480
what we needed these three things a

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,550
skill to define how user query should be

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,010
answer so there would be a skill which

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:20,320
would define the user queries which

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,209
would define the responses to the user

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,459
queries and the skill should be private

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:28,209
just like I said I don't want the other

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:30,220
people to know how my chat bots are how

00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,779
my chat bots are functioning and the

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,699
final thing is that it should apply only

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,410
to this particular chart board okay so

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,569
this is also really important currently

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,060
if there is any skill like if there is

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,860
any skill on Susie that skill is applied

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,630
to the whole Susie like if I add a new

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,910
skill it will be applied to the whole

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,709
Susie platform like on the client that

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,899
entered the is it will be applied

00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:52,180
everywhere but I don't want that with my

00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,190
chat board because if there is a scale

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,170
from my own chat but then it should be

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,269
applied to only my own chat board not

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,029
the rest of the Susie so that was also

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,170
main challenge and final point we cannot

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:04,960
do this with the previous implementation

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:08,200
so we needed something so that new thing

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,029
was private skills so this is a table

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,399
that basically shows the difference

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,950
between private skills into public

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,990
skills so public skills it applies to

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,180
Susy just like I said public skills

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,790
apply it to all of applies to all of the

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,160
Susy and the private skill they own that

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,810
only replies that only applies to your

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,510
particular chat but it doesn't apply to

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,490
all of the Susy okay second thing is

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,649
that public skill can be viewed or

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,360
editing edited by anyone but that is not

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,279
the case with private skills only the

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,290
owner of the chat bot or the creator of

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,010
the chat board can edit or delete those

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,959
private skills final thing public skills

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,089
contain responses of user queries harm

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,920
but public skills can contain responses

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,140
of user credit but that is no but

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,540
private skill contains way more than

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,610
that in case of public skill we just we

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,170
just needed the responses for user

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,880
queries we don't need anything else

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,350
because all the themes setting over all

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,420
the other things they are all already

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,100
hard-coded or they're already in the

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,810
settings of the web client or the

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,320
Android declined but in the case of

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,570
chatbots we needed way more settings

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,040
like we needed the theme of the chat bot

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,540
let's say that I want my chat but with

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,100
ring I don't want it to be plain by it

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,450
so where it sure as throw that green

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,130
color be I need to store that green

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,380
color somewhere right so there it is in

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,380
the scale only and also let's say that I

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,150
want my chat board to use only the

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,130
skills that I created I don't want it to

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,720
use the rest of the students skills how

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,370
do I save that setting where do I say

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,240
that setting that is also done in the

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,770
private skill okay so now that the

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,209
private skills know that this is the

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,490
private skill there it will apply to a

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,600
particular chat board only the board

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,240
theater can be you added and finally

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,310
there are a lot of settings so this is

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,450
private skill and this is the chat the

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,170
private skill is basically the chat

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,550
board so now the concept was ready now

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:58,880
when you need to create it so let me

00:12:51,550 --> 00:13:02,220
show you what we created okay so

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,050
this is a video that I ice cream casted

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,509
this during the final evaluation of my

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,509
jisub period I will just show you to you

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,310
okay so this is the main page of scale

00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,290
Suzy these are all the public skills

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:21,029
that are displayed here these are the

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:25,230
skill categories now let's move forward

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,639
and okay so if we click on this button

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,380
on the right hand side you'll see all

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
these options and you see the option of

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,769
bot builder so I created this bod

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,230
builder which is used to create chat

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,899
words okay so if we go to bot builder

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,459
you see the screen in this thing you

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,740
either you have a option to either

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,440
choose your own template you choose the

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,060
pre-code template template already has

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,009
some basic functionalities some basic

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,470
queries and response is written in it

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,389
and let or you can also create your chat

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,649
board from scratch so let's say that you

00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,709
want to create your chart but from

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,959
scratch so these are the templates these

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:02,009
are the these are the boards that are

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,930
already saved these are the boards that

00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:07,620
are already saved and this button you

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:11,730
use to create new chart chat boards this

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,980
is a pre okay so I have this board that

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,420
a name of the bot is Jim website bot

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,250
let's say that I want to edit this word

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,490
so I can simply just click on this board

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,019
and the skill this is the skill code

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,610
it's killing code of the bot so the

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,310
skill code will open I can just edit it

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,260
and then edit it and then save it this

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,970
is the preview of the chat board like I

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,069
said know that there are there are theme

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,779
setting over the chat board so in this I

00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:35,550
have a wallpaper I have a whole episode

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,110
where should I save this volley / we

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,870
should I save the URL of the wallpaper

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:43,319
so that is done in the skill in the

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,510
private skill okay so the last option

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:49,620
that you see is draft so draft is

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,939
basically like let's say that you don't

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,250
want to deploy your chat board you just

00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,279
want to leave it in the mid way so just

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,240
save it as a draft and continue later on

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,689
currently I don't have any drafts so

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,310
nothing is displayed over there okay you

00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,810
can also delete the chat board that's a

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,380
great button you click on that and the

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,380
