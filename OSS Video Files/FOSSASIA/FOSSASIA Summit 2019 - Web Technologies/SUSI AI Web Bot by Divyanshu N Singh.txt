SUSI AI Web bot builder is a service I created as a part of my GSoC 2018 project. This allows the users to create SUSI.AI chatbots very easily. Basic theme settings and custom replies to specific user texts are currently allowed in this chatbot. Many other features like preview of the chatbot, saving its draft, allowing bot only on specific sites etc are in initial stage and many more features are yet to build. This bot builder is built using ReactJS
