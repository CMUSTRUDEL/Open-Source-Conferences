so you can see a QR code on the screen

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,770
right now and that's the beauty of this

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,290
presentation because it is accessibility

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,509
compliant that means whenever we are

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,680
presenting it should be accessible as

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,690
well to all of us so here's the QR code

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,560
if you want to scan or you can go to the

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,250
link to get all the slides I'll wait for

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,580
a minute for those who are scanning it

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:32,719
so till I want to explain you about what

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,410
I am going to cover in this presentation

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:41,100
so you might have seen accessibility as

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,719
a huge concern after or you can say a

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:50,100
kind of concern for everyone in Eastern

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:55,140
Europe or America where they have such

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,590
acts like American Disability Act it is

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,190
coming on a global level right now and

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,159
if we are developers and we are just

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,439
coding rather than thinking like why and

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,409
how these accessible feeds if

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,750
accessibility features are important to

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,689
us we may get into trouble

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,580
in future so this talk is going to focus

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:24,600
on writing code but keeping

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,240
accessibility in mind so I'm a Google

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,030
developer expert and an open source

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,220
enthusiast working towards web

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,560
accessibility and usability web

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,600
accessibility let me define it again web

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,500
accessibility means that people with

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,110
disabilities can use the web right so it

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,369
it seems a very simple definition but

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:55,829
when we actually apply it there is youth

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:58,860
cycle of learning involved now for web

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,170
accessibility w3c which is the parent

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,189
organization of Internet has written

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,179
some rules and we call these rules WCAG

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,289
which means web content accessibility

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,660
guidelines these are the guidelines

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,770
these are the standards that we should

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,620
keep in mind why

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,590
designing a website a web application in

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,320
your industries whenever you are going

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,780
and writing code you need to keep these

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,520
guidelines into your mind while writing

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,720
code we will walk through each and every

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,660
guideline and the things we often do

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,700
that we should not do and we should

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,750
learn today so that we can avoid those

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,840
mistakes but why why should we learn

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:48,660
about accessibility or why should we

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:52,470
consider the WCAG guidelines before you

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:57,000
understand davai let's go some through

00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:00,180
some user stories a person Kyle is

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,970
having vision disability now Kyle always

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,720
wants to stay away from online classes

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,910
whenever clio for any online class he

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,010
feels it very difficult to understand

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,330
because he cannot walk through the

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:18,830
course as the website is not accessible

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:23,640
Kyle got frustrated and people like Kyle

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:26,280
just assume that 90% of websites with

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,240
online courses are not accessible so

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,510
they don't go to the websites Gordon is

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,020
another example Gordon is having a motor

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,820
disability so Gordon uses mouth stick to

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,390
type now

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,910
Gordon cannot use Mouse because he feels

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,000
frustrated with Mouse he uses Mouse

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,610
istic Gordon can access the computer but

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,040
not the web because the web is not

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,900
accessible with the mouse istic it is

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,100
accessible a bit with Mouse Curtis is

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,440
another example

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,740
Curtis is having hearing disability

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,740
which means cultists cannot listen

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,800
Curtis can only see so whenever there is

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,020
a video without any subtitles it does

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,260
not make sense to Curtis so what Curtis

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,630
do is it follows the video with it with

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,239
its inclusion so whatever comes like

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,740
intuition Curtis things like whatever is

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,700
going through the video it is telling

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,360
him a story now it's not about Curtis

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,689
God

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,969
and kind it is about 217 million people

00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:35,550
on this planet who are dealing with the

00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:39,360
same kind of problem and 37 million

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,069
people of them are blind so you can see

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
such a huge numbers so you are not

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,360
talking about three to four people

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,060
sitting in a row you are talking about

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,719
217 million people for which you can

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,509
make a website right now it's not only

00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:57,750
about empathy it's also about business

00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:00,360
it's also about legalities now when I

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,939
talk about this topic to many developers

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,849
they always think it and related kind

00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,529
with an empathy angle they say okay

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,330
we'll care it will care about those

00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:12,509
people we should come forward and we

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,669
should make website now there is another

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:21,810
angle of this whole cycle and that angle

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:24,750
is business if people like Kyle are not

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,539
going to such as Coursera type of

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,699
websites if they are not accessible they

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,599
will choose to go or they will force to

00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,810
go to their competitors like EDX now two

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:40,259
competitors fighting for a market share

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:43,800
will lose 217 million people on this

00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,560
earth if their websites are not WCAG

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,379
compliant it's a total business loss

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,740
it's not only about empathy and business

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,750
it's also about legalities there are

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,960
different acts that are coming into the

00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,719
scene today one of the art which I have

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,330
studied was American Disability Act that

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:05,909
is only applicable to a company who is

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,469
registered in America but then there is

00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,180
European Disability Act for the

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:10,800
companies who are in Europe and then

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,909
there is Australian Disability Act for

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,520
the companies who are in Australia

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:18,659
people are getting aware and it's the

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,360
time to make our self aware so I'm going

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:27,569
through the rules now which will help

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:30,240
you to think in this direction now we

00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:33,930
need to change the thinking as well how

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,819
we think we browse web do you know any

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:40,830
other way of browsing web anyone okay I

00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,430
can see mouse and a keyboard on the

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,159
screen

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:51,119
what is another way of browsing the

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:54,990
internet mobile any device any hardware

00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,990
apart from mouse and keyboard

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,839
touchscreen you are talking about maybe

00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:07,749
yes but how people browse the web I'll

00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:11,499
let you know today there are blind

00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:13,899
people who use screen reader there are

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,149
people who feels frustrated using a

00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:20,580
mouse so they use Gnostic there are

00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:25,360
people with headbands and the list is

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,969
going and going and going right we need

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,399
to change the perception and these are

00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,979
the specific type of disabilities that

00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,659
most of the people are facing

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,360
hyperactivity disorders blindness low

00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:39,039
vision hard of hearing speech and

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,969
language disabilities brain injuries

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:48,759
physical disabilities we see the

00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:51,729
user-agent the browsers and every time

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,219
we are stuck into very very little

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:57,069
problems such as making a website

00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:00,129
responsive so we start working with

00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:03,069
Chrome we make the website responsive

00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:05,649
for Chrome we take that website to

00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,749
Mozilla we try the same things and check

00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,009
if Mozilla has a breaking feature we

00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:12,009
take it to Safari

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:17,050
we just care tell our browser list ends

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:22,240
and that's all right but these are not

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:26,249
the only user agents these user agents

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,729
are screen readers screen readers are

00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:34,000
used by disabled people disabled people

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:37,419
are not aware of which browser it is

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,599
they're more aware of how that website

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:44,769
reacts to their screen readers if your

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:48,279
website is very is having very good user

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,470
experience but at the end it is not

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,870
accessible to a screen reader it is of

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,930
no use for a low vision or a blind

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,050
person

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,050
it is not the only it's not only about

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,760
spring readers as well

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:07,209
there are magnifiers which are the user

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,120
agents people with low vision also uses

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:12,339
magnifiers so whenever we design we need

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,839
to think about the browsers obviously we

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,000
need to think about the screen readers

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,370
we need to think about the magnifiers we

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,060
need to think about the other devices

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,660
such as Mouse's ticks and headbands now

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,779
obviously we cannot make a website and

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,640
can check all of these platforms but

00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,829
there are certain standards that we can

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,750
follow and if you are aware of those

00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:39,220
standards these standards make sure that

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,769
the website you are making with those

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:49,829
standards will be compliant to all these

00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:54,540
platforms so the standard are WCAG and

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:58,149
WCAG has four specific principles

00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:02,740
perceivable operable understandable and

00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:06,089
robust now we'll go through each of them

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:10,570
with each of them with examples and

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:15,120
we'll see how these features can be

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:18,250
applied to your websites every feature

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,949
out of them have their own success

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,290
criterias

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:25,570
these success criterias make sure that

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:30,459
you have applied the feature correctly

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,699
to your website II each and every

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:36,250
feature have their compliance levels

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:39,130
which means you either need to achieve

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,260
one of the compliance levels you may

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,350
achieve a you may achieve double a you

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,890
may achieve triple a triple a is the

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,230
toughest one to achieve for a website so

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,660
generally we prefer all the features

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,339
till the double a compliance if you have

00:10:52,660 --> 00:11:00,510
achieved double a compliance that means

00:10:54,339 --> 00:11:00,510
a lot so let's go with perceivable

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,950
perceivable stands for this piece of

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,310
information you have the UI components

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:15,280
but you have to represent them so that

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,280
your users can perceive the information

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,910
let's take an example of an alt text

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,370
which you use or may skip whenever you

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,400
have an image whenever you have an image

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:33,020
there is a choice of having an alt

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:37,670
attribute some people write it some

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:41,240
people miss it but the alt attribute is

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:44,300
a specific information for a screen

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,620
reader for a blind person image does not

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,290
make sense so the screen reader starts

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,320
finding the alt tag and when it gets the

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:59,120
alt tag it starts reading that this

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,730
image means this now sometimes we don't

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,890
know the alt tag for a particular image

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:09,530
so we skip writing it instead of the w3c

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,620
skyline suggest that if you don't have

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:16,940
an alt tag write all and make it blank

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:21,410
so that the screen reader skip the image

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,440
rather than reading the HTTP URL of the

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,090
image just assume how it will sound if

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,030
your screen reader is going through a

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,140
page and comes towards an image and you

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:35,030
start reading

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:37,640
I got HTTP amazing dot in /this this

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,040
this forward slashes and you're the

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,840
person for which you have made the

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,170
website it's actually listening to this

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,570
particular thing it's vague so if you

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,550
make the alt tag blank if you don't have

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,870
any information about this image it's

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:57,770
far better than not writing the oil tag

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,900
right pre-recorded audio is the second

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,570
guideline provided by perceivable

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,600
principle there are various options

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,310
available which are open source and you

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,080
can see the links which I have added

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,570
here as well there are free software's

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,700
and then there is YouTube whenever you

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,250
upload a video you can get a transcript

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,290
out

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:21,180
of that video and every time you write

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:24,210
you provide an audio to someone always

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:30,710
try to provide a transcript with the

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:35,250
audio right because people who can't see

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:38,510
or people who aren't listen can simplify

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:43,380
their situation if you provide a

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:46,770
pre-recorded audio now there is a

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,800
concept of pre-recorded video as well if

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:53,280
you see this piece of code written with

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,250
video controls there is a simple video

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,090
and then there are source example dot

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,290
mp4 and two basically web formats and

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:08,580
track so the track is the HTML tag where

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:11,310
you can provide a VTT file and that VT

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,670
file is basically the subtitles

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:18,120
associated with that particular video so

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,160
you can make your own VTT file and what

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,240
you need to just do is whenever you are

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,420
using the video tag you just need to use

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,390
the track HTML element and then have to

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:38,400
provide that we dat file as the source

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:40,800
of that track color contrast when I was

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,290
giving these kind of talks everywhere I

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,500
asked people what is your fundamental

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,570
problem and most of the people came out

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,710
with color contrast we cannot decide

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,990
colors so we decided randomly I also

00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,900
surveyed and find out most of the

00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:01,610
designers don't even understand

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:04,740
accessibility there's a huge gap between

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,950
seeing something very beautiful making

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:11,130
the user experience perfect and making

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,960
it accessible and that balance is very

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,920
important

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,990
color contrast can be achieved with the

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:24,450
simplest double a compliance using some

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:26,670
tools maintaining color contrast is it

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,540
is a challenge because you need to

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,040
maintain the

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,329
trust between the background and the

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,389
foreground color black and white always

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:39,740
looks good in terms of accessibility but

00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:43,860
when you take a shade of black / white

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,949
then you start decreasing the compliance

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,079
levels because that is visible to you

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:52,290
does not mean that will visible to

00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,810
everyone because you and the other

00:15:52,290 --> 00:16:02,790
person have different kind of vision

00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:06,480
problems orientation restricting the

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,959
orientation is also one of the issues

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,240
that comes under perceivable if you

00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:17,069
restrict the orientation of your website

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,649
into landscape or portrait there are

00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:22,350
people with motor disabilities there are

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:25,649
people who cannot move much with their

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,100
neck having some neck issues so they

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:35,250
prefer the different kind of orientation

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:39,660
in a single device resize text say no to

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:44,010
pixels every time I see a website the

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:46,980
first thing I check is the font size are

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:50,959
you still using pixels to give a font

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:56,819
size very basics right but that basic

00:16:50,959 --> 00:17:00,269
becomes a problem when you start asking

00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:05,610
a person with low vision what he's

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:08,280
seeing on your page on mobile so there

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:12,390
are specific units for font sizes

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,209
apart from pixels such as AM re M which

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,309
you should use which are related related

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,459
to their parent relative to the whole

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:26,939
HTML page you should use these units

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:32,450
instead of hard-coding pixels the second

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,450
principal after perceivable is operable

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,010
operable says the interface elements

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,490
which you are designing must be operable

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,880
now this definition will make sense when

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,270
we go through certain examples for

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,120
example if you talk about screen readers

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:57,160
into the operable category you'll come

00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:00,130
across a common mistake can anybody

00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:04,960
figure out what is the mistake in these

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,100
two lines I have used a label with the

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,530
four of username

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:16,050
I have input type text with name

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:21,040
username I have used the label because I

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:23,920
want to make the screen reader capable

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,670
of understanding my input box the

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,950
mistake here is when you run this piece

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:34,990
of code with a screen reader the screen

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,210
reader read it as edit text blank it

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,590
does not know what this input box is

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:44,650
meant for I have corrected it with

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,930
writing the ID into the input name if

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,390
you use the same ID with the fold label

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,530
mapping for is user name ID is user name

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,050
everything is fine

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,230
now when you run this piece of code it

00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,430
will show user name edit text so a

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,530
person who can't see can actually listen

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,770
to the screenreader saying user name at

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,750
the text there is a skip navigation

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,180
functionality if you go to internet

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,360
inserts what is a skip navigation you

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,430
might find there are persons there are

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,830
people who cannot go through the website

00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:21,190
with a screenreader all at once maybe a

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,170
navigation bar is too big that a person

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,080
wants to directly go to the content area

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,810
the main content area so he has to skip

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,780
the navigation bar they skip navigation

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,520
functionality is mean for the same for

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,400
the skip navigation functionality you

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:43,270
just write this piece of code where you

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:46,120
hide the navigation bar from onfocus you

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,290
just hide it and then you show it so

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,059
this piece of

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:53,200
this simple piece of code where you said

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:56,650
top as minus 200 pixel for anchor tag

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,330
the script to content anchor you are

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,610
seeing on the screen in the picture the

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,559
green is kept to content you just said

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,760
the position fixed and you said the top

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,890
is minus 200

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,530
so the skip to content is not visible on

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,960
the screen but whenever somebody focuses

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,270
on the screen with a keyboard you just

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,370
write the script to content in front of

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:19,960
him so he can tap and go directly to the

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:22,030
main content area this is the most

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,050
funniest stuff I have learned in two

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,150
years div is not equal to button

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:31,720
generally whenever I get a design from a

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,790
designer I start designing it and if the

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,500
button looks very fancy I don't use the

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,140
button tag I remove the button type

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,210
completely use the div and start styling

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,250
the division because it is quite easy

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,820
apart from messing up with the button

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,640
Styles provided by HTML that looks super

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,460
cool as a user experience but in

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,340
accessibility you have lost a lot right

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,740
so never replace the button tag with a

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,380
simple deal always use buttons because

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,840
there are various features related to

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:07,050
this button that are off views in terms

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:15,760
of screen readers low vision impairment

00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:19,410
so if this website is seen by disabled

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,670
people with low vision they may have

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:28,000
seen this website with different angle

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,590
apart from you now the problem here is

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,760
this website is blurred from the center

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,790
generally most of the low vision

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,320
problems occurs at the ends that's why

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,720
it's super important to have different

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,120
kind of margins and padding's on

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,250
different sides of the page because

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,429
there are people with low vision

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,500
impairment who cannot see the end

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:55,630
generally so you need to Center align

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:58,200
the content care about seizures there

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,360
was an incident happened in Japan and

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,909
most of the

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,940
children were hospitalized on the same

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:09,899
day due to a seizure due to a Pokemon

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,570
cartoon flash that happened after that

00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:16,260
people start taking seizures seriously

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:20,760
and here we are talking about seizures

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:24,059
in web as well so according to the

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,330
guidelines web pages should not contain

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:29,549
anything that flashes more than three

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,429
times in a single second whether you are

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:35,130
a animator or you are designing some

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:38,130
beautiful animations just try to take

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:43,350
this into your consideration proper

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:46,440
inputs so we have label we have span you

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:52,110
can see here and then we have again span

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:56,340
and then input now I don't want to show

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:58,860
this required star required to a screen

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:03,389
reader because I don't want the screen

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:07,970
reader to you know tell a person first

00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:11,250
name star I just want to read first name

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,799
right if you if you don't follow this

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:17,970
technique your screen reader start

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:20,190
reading this page as first name star so

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,889
you need to be smart here you need to

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:27,179
hide the star from a screen reader and

00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:31,799
you need to show the start to a person

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:37,279
who is not disabled you need to hide the

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:41,399
required which is written as a text from

00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:45,210
normal person and have to show required

00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:46,919
to a screen reader so this piece of code

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,639
where you have written visually hidden

00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,649
class and then Aria hidden as true is

00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:55,740
doing a magic the Aria hidden true makes

00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:59,100
sure's that screen reader should not

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,309
read this information the visually

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,830
hidden class in CSS makes sure that the

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:09,029
required is not visible to a normal

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:13,370
person so you can keep this into your

00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,370
mind while writing any input box

00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,759
sometimes it's better to write

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:23,080
repetitive code right so now we are

00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:25,359
going to simple focus visible element

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:31,049
how many of you have written this line

00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:31,049
sometimes when while writing CSS

00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:37,629
sometimes right and then generally

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,239
outline:none is mostly common between

00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:43,149
front end developers because they don't

00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:45,119
want that blue boxes of input which

00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:48,070
looks so weird for their user experience

00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,139
but these boxes are super important for

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,559
people who are using keyboard and

00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:56,559
navigating your page when you type

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,109
keyboard tab these boxes appears one by

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,779
one so sometimes it's not a better idea

00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:05,799
to use outline:none to remove the focus

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:08,799
a lot of time two independent

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:11,589
interactions the operable guidelines

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,700
suggest to have turn off adjust and

00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:17,700
extend type of interactions so just

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,570
assume that you got a message

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,700
congratulations you have won the lottery

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,769
of this much dollars click here for more

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,869
information and there is a timer that is

00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:31,539
going below it ten nine eight seven you

00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:36,039
were not able to click we lost all the

00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:38,649
dollars right timing for you can be

00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,960
different from timing of other person so

00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:42,849
if you take 10 seconds to click maybe

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,979
the other person takes 12 seconds to

00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:48,820
click so you always need to make the

00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:50,799
page somehow something like if the time

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,639
is less press the spacebar to increase

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,109
it so that is called time independent

00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:58,179
interaction so don't need to force your

00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:00,669
users to complete a task within a time

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:04,419
frame because there are people who are

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:06,279
quite slow in doing that and you don't

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:10,179
want to show this message session

00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:11,919
timeout right providing control to you

00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:15,039
users wherever you are using an

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,999
animation you are having carousal on the

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,700
page you are having a beautiful

00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:21,940
animation running always try to provide

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,950
your users control always try to have

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,730
these kind of buttons in your

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,830
application where your user

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,870
the control of your website but the user

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,630
says ok I can stop it I can replay it I

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:35,450
can pause it now this will help your

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,860
users to avoid problems like seizures if

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,060
they have seizures with the flash

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:47,900
running they can stop it

00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:51,980
right so I'll go through understandable

00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:54,020
guideline at now and then the

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:59,120
understandable guideline says to make

00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:01,520
your webpages readable it looks like

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,490
very basic here to write a language

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,270
equal to en or a language equal to your

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,980
language but that's how all screen

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,890
reader understands what is the language

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,710
of the page right so if you were writing

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,960
Lang as en actually it means a lot to a

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,740
screen reader if you skip this tag this

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,740
can be a problem

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,540
input assistance you always need to

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,150
provide the actual message with the

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,850
required right you need to write

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,500
something like if a user skips this

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,900
entry you need to provide a proper

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,150
message what it means for so that the

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:43,490
user understands what you are talking

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:48,350
about make webpages predictable don't

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:54,130
change the context just like on changing

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:56,660
the focus the last guideline is robust

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,150
content must be robust enough that it

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,220
can be interpreted by a wide variety of

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:04,340
user agents including assistive

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,250
technologies robust is a principle of

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,110
future technologies it say is that

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,540
whatever you are designing for today

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,880
must be applicable to future as well so

00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,110
you need to take care of valid HTML and

00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,150
IDs that should be unique on the page

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:22,460
whenever I ask my session I always give

00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,590
more power to my developers and this

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,750
time I'm introducing you to some tools

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:30,050
which can you can use in your day-to-day

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,710
life to take all these principles into

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,680
action

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,020
the first tool is accessibility Chrome

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,330
extension which you can download and

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,110
whenever you make a website you can just

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,230
play it

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:44,750
so that it can make Dom kind of tree

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,059
which we call it accessibility tree for

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,669
you it will tell you what is wrong and

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:53,600
where right here your screen reader will

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:55,220
not behave correctly and here it will so

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,140
you can do some accessibility testing

00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:01,100
like that with this Chrome extension

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,559
where you can check the model just at

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,799
the right and you can check it is a

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,250
button and I should write it something

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,899
like this

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,389
you can check that title is not

00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:13,519
specified in the image for that button

00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:17,510
and you should specify the title of the

00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:20,299
button here the next is the website

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,669
tenon dot IO though it is a paid website

00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:25,370
but it has a free service as well

00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:28,549
tenon dot IO helps you to simplify the

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:32,090
accessibility you can provide a link of

00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:35,330
your website at tenon dot IO and you can

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,919
run the whole you can say the whole

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:43,309
website test and tenon dot IO gives you

00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:46,490
these kind of results which says your

00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:50,149
page has this disease issues and they

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,549
will tell you to record it download it

00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:56,990
as a CSV or you can just check the

00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:59,059
errors right below it the last the next

00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,870
is color combination the color

00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:05,090
combination feature helps you to have a

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,970
correct ratio between the foreground and

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,830
the background color so that it can

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,750
achieve a double a or a triple a

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,090
compliance you can set the compliance

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:18,679
level as you can see here as triple-a or

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:21,200
double-a and that will check and set the

00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,880
foreground and background color palettes

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,470
for you it can give you the right color

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,389
palette which you should use as a

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:31,730
foreground and background colors total

00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:33,559
why I call it total why but you can call

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,380
it whatever you want but this is from

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,230
Khan Academy this is a kind of bookmark

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,730
which you can keep in your chrome and

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,320
whenever you are working on a page or

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:46,130
our website or if you want to analyze

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,620
any website this bookmark gives you lot

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,240
of information like that and it says

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,399
your headings are not correct your

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,120
contrast ratios are not correct you need

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,720
to improve on

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,900
your images are not having alt text you

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,850
are not designing your website you know

00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,400
keeping a screen reader in your mind and

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:07,490
a lot of issues are actually visible

00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,440
with a kind of format just like try it

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:13,430
and you can try it and correct the

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,880
mistakes chrome has already provided

00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:19,100
audit tab recently into the chrome

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,980
developer tools you can run an audit of

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,680
your website from chrome developer tools

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,929
itself and can check where your website

00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,100
in terms of accessibility where your

00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:32,870
website is not performing well and you

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,520
can see the whole report like that and

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,160
the score that chrome audit tools gives

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,260
you such as 74 or something and you can

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,640
improve the scores based on the report

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:47,600
given to you below it so just a quick

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,760
wrap-up what we learned so far wcag 2.0

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,650
overview how it is important the four

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,770
principles perceivable operable

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:59,000
understandable and robust and finally

00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:01,400
the tools of accessibility testing this

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,980
is super important to learn and then

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,800
apply using the tools because I believe

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,360
human intervention is important even if

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,250
you have a lot of tools in your hand

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,929
right it's a human intervention and the

00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,740
tools which makes your websites

00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:22,100
accessible so finally you can follow

00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,170
this timeline of keeping every principle

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,929
in your mind starting from all tags

00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,120
captioning contrast ratios orientation

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:31,820
seizures time independent interactions

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,290
give user control resizing your text a

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,870
skip navigation keyboard navigation

00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:38,330
making websites readable making it

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,179
predictable unique IDs that comes under

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:46,160
robust principles validated HTML content

00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:47,840
and finally error handling so what are

00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,580
your next step whatever you are

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,250
designing whatever you have designed so

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:56,450
far just go through these three steps

00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:58,790
run fix and then follow so run a chrome

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,740
audit maybe today and fix issues

00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,690
whatever comes in your mind in terms of

00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,119
perceivable operable understandable and

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:09,149
robust and finally follow some community

00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,849
accessible community Google Groups or on

00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:13,529
github and try to see what issues they

00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:15,629
are working on right now if you want to

00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:18,149
collaborate or want to discuss you can

00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:20,909
discuss as well so finally it is done

00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:24,479
from my side if you have any questions

00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:27,299
you can ask any questions here's my

00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:33,589
medium Twitter and Langdon which you can

00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:33,589
check do we have any questions yeah

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,550
[Music]

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,040
okay so it's a good question and yeah I

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,480
mean whenever we have deadlines it's

00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,040
very difficult to keep all these

00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,859
principles in mind because you need to

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,619
somehow meet the deadlines one of the

00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:31,770
things you can try is ten and dot IOC

00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:34,020
ICD integration when you have ten and

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,819
dot IO CICU integrated in your project

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,230
whenever you push a commit on github it

00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:43,020
can give you a report if you are liking

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:46,859
accessibility it takes like two to three

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:52,669
seconds to run that is any other

00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:52,669
questions okay thank you so much

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,159
