Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Web Technologies
Description: 
	15 March 2019 16:30, Training Room 2-1

Wiki Education Dashboard connects higher education with Wikipedia. I spent my summer working on this project in Outreachy Round 16 and continue to mentor in Outreachy Round 17 and Google Code-in 2018.This session will involve how to get started with React, how Wiki Education makes it possible for students and scholars to successfully contribute to open knowledge that reaches to millions of people. Lastly, my goal would be to inspire women and trans people to participate in Outreachy -  3 months internship opportunity for underrepresented people in tech to work in FOSS.

	00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,910
hello everyone my name is Vichy and I'm

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,440
a third-year undergrad at Delhi

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,160
Technological University so I'm

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,349
currently pursuing computer science and

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,650
today I'm going to talk about my

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,770
internship experience at outreach e with

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,710
Vicki education dashboard so basically

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,900
the purpose of my talk would be three

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,160
topics that is what is the week

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,099
education dashboard

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,960
what is react and what is outreach II so

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,420
I do really wish to talk about react but

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,000
I saw that there has been a lot of talks

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,120
already talking about react and I don't

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,870
think 20 minutes are enough to cover

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,300
these three it says but I want to give a

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,600
really small brief about react on how to

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,210
get started with it so initially let's

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,149
start with what is Vicki irrigation so

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,370
according to their website it says VK

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,859
dication connects higher education to

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,750
Wikipedia ensuring that the world's most

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,990
read source of information is more

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,970
representative accurate and complete

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,159
so it says Wikipedia is the world's most

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,159
read source of information and I truly

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,659
believe it's not so because ever since

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,290
I've known how to use the internet or

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,890
how to Google

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,890
I've known Wikipedia but how does it

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,460
connect higher education with Wikipedia

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,890
and it does that through the wiki

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,159
education dashboard which is also known

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,990
as the programs and events - mode but

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
what is this dashboard and what does it

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,509
do so this dashboard provides a tool

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,770
that helps instructors and students to

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,520
share the knowledge and track their

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,729
contributions so instructors can create

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,259
and manage a wikipedia assignment and

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,680
students can stay informed and learn how

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,850
to edit Wikipedia so I'm sure everybody

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,740
knows about Wikipedia in this room and

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,430
has anybody already contributed to

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,590
Wikipedia but we all all of us have read

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,140
Wikipedia or have gone to it for some

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,830
kind of information maybe doing your

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,680
homework or projects so me being an

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,409
instructor suppose I am at some you know

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,719
and I don't want my students to copy

00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,180
each other's assignments and submit

00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,719
homework on which they have not really

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,180
worked on so and I want my students to

00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,719
work on something which is also useful

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,150
for other people and being a student

00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,739
I want my homework do not end up in

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,489
trash by the end of the semester

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:41,719
so I can create suppose I take a class

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,969
in history and I can create an

00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:49,700
assignment or a course from the

00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,700
dashboard so

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:02,159
this is the dashboard and these are some

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,959
existing campaigns so suppose I want my

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,709
students to learn more about national

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,680
Women's Studies Association or I want

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,530
them to contribute to it so I will

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,950
create a campaign and I will add some

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,900
courses to them for example radical

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,500
women in Latin American art so my

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,420
students would edit Wikipedia articles

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,799
or they can create Wikipedia articles or

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:33,049
they can submit any media that is images

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,819
or videos or anything that they can and

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,319
what this dashboard does for me is I can

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:42,269
track their contributions so these are

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,049
the articles that have been edited under

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:48,480
this particular course and what I can

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,720
track is the number of characters added

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,060
that is the sum of characters added to

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,599
articles by enrolled editors between the

00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,120
start and end dates and these are the

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,349
number of views that these articles got

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,769
and this is just a quick article viewer

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:12,000
which tells me visually what that

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:16,519
student has edited so right now it's

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,690
loading so yeah all the text in this

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:25,919
lavender color is what the student

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:28,080
contributed to yep so apart from

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,440
Wikipedia we also know Wikipedia is not

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,389
just text it's also images so my project

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,820
was to go up on this tab the uploads tab

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:41,760
earlier it used to look quite different

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,940
from what it is right now so I initially

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,440
began with creating a gallery view of it

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,419
what you can see on Google search or

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,510
Flickr and after that I decided to do a

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:57,090
user research which all of the and talk

00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:00,090
with the users who use this dashboard

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,340
and ask them what they would like these

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,740
the dashboard to do and what they don't

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,159
really like what the dashboard already

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,810
does

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:10,800
so when I

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,350
I talked with one user he said that he

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:19,620
had this gallery view because it

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:22,950
reminded him of tumblr so the question

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,680
was what to do then I noticed that

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,720
Flickr also has these three views which

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,660
is the gallery view the list view and a

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,910
card or Thai view so we so I talked with

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,590
my mentor and we decided to keep all

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,419
these three views so the tile view was

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,610
what it used to be earlier the list

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,950
views what it used to be earlier but I

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,419
also but we also added more information

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,860
to detail and the tile view was a

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,700
combination of the gallery view and the

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,260
list view so it also has the images we

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,590
can also see the images that we want

00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:00,320
along with the text so this dashboard

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,180
currently runs in two configurations

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,040
this is the education dashboard which is

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,350
mostly used by university professors and

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,340
students and this is the programs and

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,220
events dashboard

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,340
suppose I really want to make an article

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,160
about the fossae Xie cement this year so

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,000
I would create a program for fossae

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,370
sheis on midnight 2019 and I can share

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,970
the link with all of you to enroll into

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,220
that program and add articles what

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:37,310
happened in this summit or images that

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:39,930
you have and I can see all the edits and

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:47,240
all the images that have been

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:47,240
contributed so these are some stats

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:58,390
so ever since the dashboard came out in

00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:01,260
2010 we've had about 2.8 thousand big

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,260
education courses

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,539
yeah and about 58,000 students have

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,930
worked on it and 75,000 articles have

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,120
been worked on approximately 53 million

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,939
words have been added and 438 million

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,830
views for all of the articles combined

00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,270
now the dashboard now coming to the

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,610
development side of the dashboard the

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,099
dashboard uses react on the front-end

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,020
and Ruby on Rails on the backend so I

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:44,250
worked on react mainly on the front end

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,439
on the uploads tab so what is the arc

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:51,840
reactors a JavaScript library for

00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:55,500
building user interfaces it is the V of

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,750
an MVC framework the view from a Model

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,389
View controller framework so the model

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,550
is your data view is what you see on

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,439
your screens and controller controls

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,090
that data how it is presented on your

00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:11,939
screen so when I learned react

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:16,020
it was the document I am a learner who

00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:19,830
learns while coding so I really enjoyed

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,419
working on the dashboard and if I'm sure

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,449
people would have heard about code

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:27,289
Academy so I use that to learn a lot of

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:31,219
things and it helps me to get a

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:35,399
structure of how these frameworks work

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:38,279
and documentation so the documentation

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,949
of react is excellent so you can work

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,890
you can learn react with the

00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:47,910
documentation and by coding using code

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,949
Academy now how did I get this

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,980
internship and how did I get a chance to

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:56,100
work on the education - mode what is

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,540
outreach e how DT provides internships

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,779
to work in free and open source software

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,060
force obviously internships are open to

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,970
applicants around the world and you have

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,430
to work remotely you don't have to move

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,100
to another place and all the interns are

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,050
paid a stipend of five thousand five

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,329
hundred US dollars for three months and

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,690
also along with that stipend the interns

00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:24,210
also have a travel stipend up to five

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,100
hundred US dollars so that's the reason

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,230
why I'm able to come here and speak

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,230
