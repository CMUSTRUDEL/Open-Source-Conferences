Wiki Education Dashboard connects higher education with Wikipedia. I spent my summer working on this project in Outreachy Round 16 and continue to mentor in Outreachy Round 17 and Google Code-in 2018.This session will involve how to get started with React, how Wiki Education makes it possible for students and scholars to successfully contribute to open knowledge that reaches to millions of people. Lastly, my goal would be to inspire women and trans people to participate in Outreachy -  3 months internship opportunity for underrepresented people in tech to work in FOSS.
