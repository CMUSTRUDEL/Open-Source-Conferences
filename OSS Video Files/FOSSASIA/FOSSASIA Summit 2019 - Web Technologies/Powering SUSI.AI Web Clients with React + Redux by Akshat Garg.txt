	15 March 2019 15:00, Training Room 2-1

The talk will focus on SUSI.AI Web Clients and the migration to Redux from conventional Flux architecture based stores, alongside ReactJs. I am hoping to cover the following points -

Introduce the SUSI.AI architecture in brief and begin by introducing the SUSI.AI Web Clients and the purpose of each of them.
The current stack and implementation of the web clients.
State the reason and advantages for the migration, and how would it be the best-fit.
The directory structure and coding pattern that we use for this implementation and how it is scalable.
Discussion about the middle-wares used while setting up the Redux store and the helpers used for making API calls.
How Redux solves the problem of carrying out actions asynchronously and update the UI state of the application.
Briefly mention about the slight differences in the  implementation in the chat application and CMS would then be followed.
Will conclude the talk about the future plans that we are trying to implement for the SUSI.AI Web clients, that would include setting up a common repository for making the UI components for SUSI.AI to be built using styled-components.
Also mention the channels through which the developers can reach out and start contributing.
