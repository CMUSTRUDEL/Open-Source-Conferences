GraphQL is an open source query language for APIs that solves some of the problems REST runs into when using it for complex web applications. While it was only published in 2015, there is now a large number of libraries available for it, including Java Script and Django.

This talk will present an introduction to GraphQL and my own experience of building a mid-sized web application using Django as backend and Vue.js as frontend with GraphQL. Sections:

Intro to GraphQL - Schemas, queries and mutations
Implementations server-side (Django)
Implementations client-side (Apollo, graphql.js)
Patterns for common web application tasks compared: REST vs. GraphQL
  a, user registration
  b, account details
