Every single day we are making rapid progress in the field of AI / ML. What does it mean for a news media company? The core business of SPH is news. We have many publications like Straits Times, Business Times , Zaobao, Berita Harian, Tamil Marasu. We publish in English , Chinese, Tamil and Malay. We have many journalists , editors and sub-editors. They all work hard to create high quality and engaging contents for our readers. Contents are in text, audio and video. There are many manual work that we do in every day life. For example someone writes stories in English and then someone else writes the same story in Chinese/Tamil/Malay. We consume external feeds from other news agencies , we manually sift through them to assign them as per themes like sports, fashion etc. While writing stories we spend time in thinking about the keywords for the article so that it can be searched online. We record interviews and then try to listen It to write stories. Now all this are time consuming, our creativity is lost in doing manual work. How can AI help in automating all this manual work. ? How can AI help us to automatically translate article in one language to another language, how can AI help us in converting raw data into readable text, how can AI help us in suggesting keywords for out articles? I will try to cover some of the key initiatives at SPHTech that we are driving in the area of AI for the newsroom.

	00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,560
we introduced Sanjeev Kumar Vishwas so

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,300
Sanjeev are you here all miked up I'll

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,280
give you a brief introduction which is

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,599
that some jeans got over 19 years

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,940
experience working in the software

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,410
industry he'd been at Adobe Systems for

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,180
13 years and worked as a lead architect

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,029
on many other products and initiatives

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,609
he was a dhobi distinguished inventor an

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,449
Adobe founder Award winner and he's also

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:30,330
filed 23 patents in the USA and more

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,270
than 30 filed in the US Patent Office

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,250
so Sanjeev asks how a I can help in

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,410
automating all the manual work in

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,489
journalism and publishing this

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,250
representing Singapore Press Holdings

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,719
and how AI can help to automatically

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,550
translate articles from one language to

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,370
another and so he'll cover these

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:52,739
initiatives part of your portfolio thank

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:55,050
you thank you thanks for inviting me

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:01,730
this is really exciting you know I am

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,730
here to show and share what we are doing

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,210
but before that I would like to just by

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:12,299
show of hands how many of you actually

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:15,750
beat you know the physical paper no a

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,600
space employees are not allowed so only

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,250
three four so that's why you see now we

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,860
need to and how many of you actually

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:29,430
read news on mobile phones so you know

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,960
that that's that's kind of known to

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:38,579
everybody and we need to see how SPH can

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,390
transition from being print only news to

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,399
digital and that's where this whole

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,130
digital transformation is happening at

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,520
Ice pH and I'm here to share see all the

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,670
things that we are trying to do so I

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,470
think I've already been introduced the

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,850
one thing that you don't know I have no

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,560
background in

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:05,530
no bedroom zero so I was in Adobe for 13

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,310
years and I was more into R&D research

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,740
and development so it quickly goes

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,800
through the introduction of Singapore

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:17,290
Press Holdings so as you can see here we

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:24,010
have lot of publications but English

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:26,800
Tamera Malay and Chinese and our

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,220
flagship publications are straits time

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,880
Business Times and zawa zawa is very

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,880
popular in China

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:43,209
so apart from publications news we are

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,160
also into magazines radio outdoor media

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,690
advertisement and of course property

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,730
don't ask me why

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,400
so you know that's what keeps the

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,790
revenue coming in so we are into

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,230
multiple vertical business what our core

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:04,630
strength has always been news so I will

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:07,090
share how open source is helping us to

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,730
go digital and what are the things that

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,200
we have done already and what we are

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,670
going to planning to do in the coming

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,670
few months and years

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,400
before that I just want to give you very

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:26,830
brief highlight on the landscape or

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:30,520
where we use the open-source Drupal is

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:34,480
the core of it I will tell you how if

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,060
you see around Drupal we have frameworks

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,310
tools which is mainly for machine

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,340
learning and AI right so we'll go

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:46,210
through that one by one so I will show

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,060
you three use cases which we are have

00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,840
done already something on and - it's

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,580
something

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,540
open we are pursuing that so let's talk

00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,640
about this right

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,890
so Drupal as most of you know it's an

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:07,390
open source and there is a community

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:10,660
around it and in SPH we have this tuple

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:14,440
has two different types of offering one

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:17,500
is where the editors go and write down

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,950
the stories for web publishing right but

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,620
as you know SPH is also into print right

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,740
so the drupal system that we have used

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,930
is actually also handles the content

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,970
written for print so we have a different

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:37,390
CMS for print and so that's where all

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,220
the stories starts so the journalist or

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,310
enters will go there write their stories

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:46,390
and that will flow into the drupal

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,270
system and it will be prepared for the

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,070
online version of it so it doesn't mean

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,950
that the content written on the print

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,680
was it goes as is so lot of edits

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,450
happens and lot of changes happens we

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,180
insert a lot of images videos

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,850
appropriately which we cannot do on the

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,190
print side right so that's why the

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,210
Drupal impregnates with the prints of

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:14,140
system and so if you can see the list

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,900
here we are using Drupal for our both am

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,470
TM EMT M stands for English Malay Tamil

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,700
media CMD stands for Chinese media so we

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:28,090
are using Drupal for both this group in

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,500
Drupal we are using some of the custom

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,180
modules like you know how

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,600
to handle print I just explained how we

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,410
have linked print content in the models

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,280
we use the views tools and panels the

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,680
spirited media and we also try to

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,050
contribute to the community we write

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,690
components customize it we try to share

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:54,610
it with the community all right so so

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:59,230
the next one is article recommendation

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:03,730
system right as you know that if you are

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:06,340
reading an article on let's say donor

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:09,160
prompts in the allegation or on terms

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,380
and you would like to as you go through

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,220
the story you would like to know more

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,770
about the background you know and then

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,810
you would like to see that being

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,790
recommended up front you don't want to

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,560
go to google and search for articles

00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:29,740
right so that's kind of not the right

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,910
way to do so what we have done is we

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,890
have build a system where we collect a

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,560
lot of content so we we are there is no

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,050
shortage of contents because we create

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,950
contents right so we take all the

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:49,380
contents and using this open source you

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:54,010
know all the framework that we have we

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:57,490
first clean up the text get rid of all

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,620
the stock birds to limitations and then

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,979
build a model so there are different

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,950
ways of building models so some models

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:08,350
will actually focus on the entity

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,960
Ragueneau who is the main entity we

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,130
talked about in this article some model

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,280
will focus on a theme where we use Lda

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,340
later and decrypt a location modeling

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,800
it's basically combining all the

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,010
articles together it will do the

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:31,030
clustering and then for each cluster

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:34,930
we'll have the common articles clubbed

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,419
together so think about it like if you

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,430
are more interested so each cluster will

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:43,270
be specific to a theme it's like a

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:45,849
dramatic level and so that's the model

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,669
that we are built and once that model is

00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:51,220
will we use it in the production system

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,740
where if you go through the states m.com

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,150
you read an article we feed that

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,259
information to the system and it

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,150
triggers her output and so as you can

00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,789
see there are so many articles right how

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,400
do we decide which articles to recommend

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,500
so their system works in two level one

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,370
is at the bottom level which gives you

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,909
the entire cluster and it has all kind

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,940
of articles right but from that cluster

00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:21,880
of articles you want to extract a subset

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,060
out of it and we don't know which subset

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,190
makes sense right so we run god of Av

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,150
tests we lower our not of hypotheses

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,709
around the trendiness of articles so in

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,560
that cluster we'll pick out those

00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:39,339
articles which are trending with and we

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,320
may also pick out those articles which

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,290
are kind of could be random distribution

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,350
right and then we surface it to the to

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,720
the user so it works at a two level you

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,579
know first first you give you get the

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,600
whole cluster and the second level you

00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:58,930
pick up randomize or do some heuristics

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,600
to pick up which you want to surface so

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,600
let me show you a demo

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:14,180
so it's all on production so I'm just

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,810
opening this article and try to ignore

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,270
all the ads and images on the top and

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,500
right side so if you read this article

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,500
this is more

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,190
to take it

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,199
this is a problem

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,380
intro

00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:00,600
oh sorry all right thank you so I'm

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,790
going this is straight CENTCOM and I'll

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,920
just open an article and this article if

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,350
you can see the headline you know

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:13,100
something about women entering politics

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:16,670
right and so ignore all these adverts

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,230
don't ask me why these are so many ads

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,630
so in states times we have allocated

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,400
some some section at the bottom for

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,170
premium contents you know ignore that

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,720
here so this is the one so so here you

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,930
see it's surfacing articles which are

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,480
closely related to the article that you

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,740
are reading right even the image looks

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,990
the same actually is the same person

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,970
actually so that's what the

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:50,720
recommendation system is so now we'll go

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,720
to the second one the second slide

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,110
Oh

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,910
what's next so Auto Tiger what does it

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,860
mean so imagine you are an editor or a

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,590
journalist you're writing a story and

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,040
you want to make sure that your article

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:13,280
is searchable and it's faces quickly to

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,890
the consumer so for that what happens in

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,770
the newsroom is when when the editor is

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,010
writing the story he has to basically

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:25,790
append some tags it's like a metadata so

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,830
tags like it's contextual and it earlier

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,570
it used to be totally this decided by

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,520
the editor itself whether what kind of

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,610
keywords he wants to attach to each

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,190
article so that's kind of very manual

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,560
and an incorrect in some fashion because

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,380
each individual has a different way of

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,020
thinking and the keywords that getting

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,810
attached leads to a lot of instability

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,240
so we build an auto Tiger using magpie

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,240
get a sense of flow and Spacey you know

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,030
also open source and as I said we don't

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,820
have any shortage of contents we have a

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,640
lot of content we also have historic

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,460
keywords being attached so we use that

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,730
information to train the model and it's

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:12,200
like a multi-level classification model

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:15,050
that we use and given an article that

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,260
you write based on what you have written

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,750
context entity and you know key words it

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,960
will suggest those key words and

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,480
entities also now it's easier for the

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,090
editor to select or deselect and

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,930
drag-drop whichever he the keywords he

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:35,660
wants to use and then publish it out so

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,180
that works as a search criteria so it's

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,660
like a search search criteria keywords

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,470
that people will use on the web so let

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,470
me show you a demo

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,160
so this is a standalone application that

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,160
we have all that I need to do is just

00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:00,860
copy the article any any article that I

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:05,380
see so let me pick this one is something

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:09,730
I found today something on impeachment

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,730
of Donald Trump or something like that

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,080
that's it all I have to show this award

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,889
is this something more this was just you

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:41,339
know that I don't copy all of them so

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:43,260
imagine that the editor has written this

00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,200
article right all the journalist has

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,480
written this article now before anything

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,899
gets published before this content gets

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,639
stored in my CMS system I need to tag it

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:59,519
so just hit this tag button and it

00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,110
surfaces or suggests some tags like to

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,839
another term which of course the article

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,329
is all about something our tutor

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,829
elections 2016 but there is something

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,260
missing if you have read this article

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:12,209
there is or let me come back to that so

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,430
entities it shows you the entities you

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,430
know and also the keywords right so now

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,170
I the the editor can just drag drop and

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,860
seal it and add the tags here and the

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,480
bottom but there is something wrong with

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,060
if you have read this article there is

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:34,920
something missing

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:38,279
any guesses but so those in PC you don't

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,699
see the word impeachment yeah so so what

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,920
does it mean so it means that we have to

00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,899
work even more harder to build a good

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,730
good model right so that's a never

00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,589
learning process we have continued to

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:57,600
build our models and make it more

00:14:49,589 --> 00:15:01,920
efficient so all right so that's the

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,199
auto tagger all right so now the next

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
two items that I'm going to show a share

00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,910
is basically something which we are

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,699
trying to solve we haven't started yet

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:14,100
but you know it's a you know if you are

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:16,500
interested if you want to join our hand

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,910
in the jointer or forces please you're

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,640
all welcome

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,130
what does robo journalism means you may

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,709
have heard about it robots writing

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:30,980
stories and based on some raw data so we

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:35,850
don't want to do anything fancy you know

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:39,329
so this pain point is that you have this

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,640
Co e data right a CoA is that for

00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,050
vehicles you know every every week there

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,600
is a bidding happens on the vehicles

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:49,320
certificate in same

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,960
and that's like structure data also the

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,470
ZX data the singable stock exchange data

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,240
you know which is kind of structured and

00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,560
also unstructured and structured is free

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,610
you have to pay extra money for

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:06,000
structured data so can we come use this

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,560
structured new medical raw data right

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,770
something like this you know it shows

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,170
you the month which category of vehicle

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,480
amount you know how many meters and all

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,960
that think what can we use this

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,600
numerical data and write a story which

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,970
looks like this because right now what

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
happens is that whenever this report

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:30,720
comes in to SPH one journalist from

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,690
english will spend time studying this

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,000
data and writing that article not only

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,580
that someone from the Chinese department

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,560
will look into the same raw data and

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,390
write the Chinese article so you can see

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,520
two people spending time on the same

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:47,460
data and coming up with two different

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,220
articles so can we do something using

00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:54,720
all the open source that we have build

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,420
new models to convert raw data into you

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,820
know readable text not only that can be

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,850
used some order to convert the English

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:08,220
text into Chinese and make the life of

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:11,520
our journalists very easy so last one is

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,190
fake names I was debating whether to put

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,410
it here or not because we create news

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,740
why should we be interested in fake news

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:24,600
right fake news are important because

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:27,990
two of two reasons in SPH we don't it's

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,510
not just we create the articles right we

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,820
also consume articles from other sources

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,900
like New York Times Washington Post and

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,560
we publish them at our site that's one

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,060
thing the second thing is our readers

00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,370
they also want to get some confidence

00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:48,840
when they read our stories whether it's

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:50,550
you know true or fake right so how can

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,880
we address this problem so there are

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,280
some open sources available some are

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,690
dubious some are kind of you know

00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,009
exciting too

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,690
no based on the result that they have

00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:06,659
shared till late can we do something

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,960
about it and build some kind of system

00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:12,750
where we can show and convince our

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,940
reader that the the texts the articles

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,590
that they're reading is actually genuine

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,779
you know it's coming from a genuine

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:24,980
source contents are all real

00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:27,990
there is nothing faking it so mean

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:40,710
that's all I have to share open to

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:42,750
questions we are of course how are we

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,100
behind schedule so let's take one

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:50,840
question while the next setup occurs any

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,840
questions oh c'mon

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,840
yep

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,890
good so the question is why Drupal why

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,789
not WordPress or some other you know

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:17,029
so we tried WordPress we used to use

00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:21,320
WordPress in the beginning but we faced

00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:24,169
some issues around you know it doesn't

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,919
did not scale up to our expectations so

00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:31,340
we moved to Drupal and we also got

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,090
support from Drupal community too and

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,529
that's what we have been using very

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,139
rigorously and you know it's been

00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:42,529
working well but you know in the media

00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:45,649
industry we have this problem of print

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:48,740
and digital news right so there is no

00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:51,289
one CMS which does both together and at

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,929
the same time so everybody has separate

00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:56,149
system for brained one for digital so we

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,370
are thinking debating whether to build

00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:03,380
or do something about it and have one

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:05,120
CMS which does both alright well thank

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,320
you very much first time I've seen what

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,320
