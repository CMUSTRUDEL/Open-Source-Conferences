Every single day we are making rapid progress in the field of AI / ML. What does it mean for a news media company? The core business of SPH is news. We have many publications like Straits Times, Business Times , Zaobao, Berita Harian, Tamil Marasu. We publish in English , Chinese, Tamil and Malay. We have many journalists , editors and sub-editors. They all work hard to create high quality and engaging contents for our readers. Contents are in text, audio and video. There are many manual work that we do in every day life. For example someone writes stories in English and then someone else writes the same story in Chinese/Tamil/Malay. We consume external feeds from other news agencies , we manually sift through them to assign them as per themes like sports, fashion etc. While writing stories we spend time in thinking about the keywords for the article so that it can be searched online. We record interviews and then try to listen It to write stories. Now all this are time consuming, our creativity is lost in doing manual work. How can AI help in automating all this manual work. ? How can AI help us to automatically translate article in one language to another language, how can AI help us in converting raw data into readable text, how can AI help us in suggesting keywords for out articles? I will try to cover some of the key initiatives at SPHTech that we are driving in the area of AI for the newsroom.
