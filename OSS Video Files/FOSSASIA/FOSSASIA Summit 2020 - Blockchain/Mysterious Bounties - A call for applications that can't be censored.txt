all right and now we are recording so

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,000
hello everyone my name is Connor I'm

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,010
with the get Coyne team we have a few

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,900
people from the mysterium team here to

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,509
talk about there can't be censored

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,000
challenges as well as the their bounties

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,619
in the funny in the future hackathon so

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,619
everyone thank you so much for joining

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,210
us and we are working on mysterious

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,390
bounties and we've partnered with get

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,939
coin over here for funding the future to

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,189
drive more open source development on

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,899
our projects mysterium network we're

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,079
building a decentralized distributed

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,300
open permissionless network and we're

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,100
looking at working with you guys to

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,440
build more consumer level applications

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,269
I'd like to introduce Campanas who is

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,480
going by zulia today and yarrow who is

00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:53,789
also in the call so Antanas does leads

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,589
our network game is el sitio and yarrow

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,059
is I've had a product over at the fair

00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,850
network so all your questions they will

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,949
you're in very safe head everyone thank

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,610
you for coming here nice to see so many

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,369
people here we really appreciate you

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,799
coming here just to listen what you have

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:16,710
to say and our main topic here is to

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,619
explain what you can do this mr. Network

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,960
and how you can get started with the

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,869
short introduction and then with

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,320
questions so I'm going to share my

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,320
screen

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:40,670
can you speak my screen guys yeah cool

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:43,110
so what is mysterium it's a network a

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,600
distributed network of nodes which are

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,250
providing the VPN service in exchange

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,180
for cryptocurrency

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,820
so usually people look to VPN service as

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,070
something here either you run on your

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:02,520
own either your bank account in some

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:06,060
centralized company and and then you're

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,009
using their servers to exit somewhere in

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,370
the internet the problem with that

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,920
approach is that that centralized place

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,080
still can have acts

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,810
to the exit locks and many other issues

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,940
in terms of mysterion we do have the

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,730
pool of people who are lounging

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,950
different kind of nodes that could be

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,950
data center nodes that could be notes on

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:40,160
raspberry PI's at their home that could

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:43,560
be exit node run on their computer and

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,510
available just while they are not using

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,590
internet or something like that

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:56,519
and and actually the moment we already

00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:06,470
have it on test net we are going we are

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:06,470
working very hard to go to main net but

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,519
at the moment 600 active providers

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,900
sometimes we have 800 active providers

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,829
which are providing exit polls most of

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,139
them are in UK United States Italy

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,299
Germany as you see on maps those dots

00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,060
but actually we do have exit nodes in

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,510
many places all around the globe

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,880
and we do have users at the moment we

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,000
have about 10,000 people who are already

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,849
living and we don't do active promotion

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,090
at this stage because we would like to

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,790
build first prepared product for people

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,280
to use but still people are finding us

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,579
somehow and they are using it so it's

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,519
proving and it's giving us big hope that

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,190
we are doing something very useful it's

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,880
interesting to see that most users are

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:07,560
from India Iran Pakistan Indonesia

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:10,169
United Emirates Arab Emirates 2k China

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,410
so the whole all places where you could

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,620
imagine that they have problems with

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:18,660
governments and different limitations

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:24,090
could be there in d8 a little bit

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:26,490
surprising but still and the aim of our

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,300
network is to have residential mostly

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,490
residential

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,169
but still data center notes also are

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,110
possible wire is a venture not because

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:40,560
there are many services when you go to

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:44,610
use them which will try to detect if you

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,099
are not VPN user and if for example

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:51,509
somebody is travelling and would like to

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:54,810
watch Netflix BBC from outside of the UK

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:57,659
for example he is not able to reach that

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,940
and if he will use just data center node

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,039
or people used centralized VPN most

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,990
probably BBC will still say that that's

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,659
a VPN service and it's not available for

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,300
you but we are mysterium exit nodes

00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:14,659
which are mostly at homes for of people

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:19,110
homes it's totally possible and let's

00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:22,800
let's move a little bit forward so this

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:27,199
network has couple of components main

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:31,349
main infrastructure things so we do have

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,270
consumers and providers so what is

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:37,830
consumer it's a client application you

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,870
would think but actually our software we

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,050
would have the wrapper on the github

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:48,150
called node it's a software written in

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:51,569
dolan and that's software which could be

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,300
run in a consumer mode or in provider

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,310
mode and actually consumer applications

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,840
could be built different ones and they

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:03,060
can use this node software as a library

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,300
I will talk a little bit later about

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,729
that and provider nodes also could be

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,979
run in Linux machines maybe on Mac

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:13,289
machines they could have into a UI

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,830
interface or Canon common line interface

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:21,060
but still those interfaces will be using

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,370
this node implementation and while

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,279
consumer is connecting to provider first

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,229
he is doing discovery and watching for

00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,930
available providers on the network and

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:33,870
is able to filter out provider by

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,570
country by type of IP for example

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,789
residential or just I give it bandwidth

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,639
and maybe I don't care to have

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,669
residential IP but I need better

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,009
with speed performance and then they're

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,439
establishing VPN tunnel

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,780
at the moment we support two protocols

00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,460
but actually our software can support a

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,620
couple of different protocols we support

00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:01,469
Open VPN and wire guard protocols but

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,669
it's extendable it could be also proxy

00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:08,939
circuit five it could be even tour so

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:11,969
you could try to use VPN when you need

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,610
to VPN like exit to Netflix and when you

00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:18,360
want even more privacy you have one

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:22,289
additional hope and there is something

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,310
we call harmless hop because actually we

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:28,169
are using for payments we are using

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,990
second layer solution on top of Afyon

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:34,529
blockchain it sounds similar to how

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:40,289
lightning Network works just simplified

00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:43,889
model adapted to our cases and hürmüz

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:46,020
it's hop through which with which

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,909
consumers and providers are establishing

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,250
payment channels I will talk a little

00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:55,800
bit more about payment infrastructure

00:07:50,250 --> 00:08:00,180
later our most usefully like currently

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:04,979
we have one client application ready to

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:10,289
use it's mobile Android application it's

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:14,279
also open source and you can find in our

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:16,529
github just go github.com slash

00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,490
mysterium network and here you will find

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,680
mysterium VPN mobile and here you can

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,740
get the code of our mobile application

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:31,710
you can extend it it's an open-source

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:35,969
license and you can use it or contribute

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:38,039
to us it especially could be interesting

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:42,419
for people who would like to jump in to

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:45,060
challenge to adapt it to TVs because one

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:50,490
of our challenge is make our mobile

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:53,220
application feasible for Android TVs so

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,050
it's mostly playing with screen

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,810
resolutions and stuff like that

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,550
very good task to start and it's also

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,580
good solution for people who would like

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:06,269
to watch the streaming services via

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,550
mysterium Network and so in our Android

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:13,140
application like in there are two ways

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:18,870
how you can use our node software one is

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:21,240
as using our node as a library static

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:26,089
linking with it as we do in our mobile

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:30,750
application so in general in general we

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:33,240
we have published on like this maybe

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:38,510
package which the different node

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:42,750
versions which you can import into your

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:47,640
Kotlin or Java code mobile code and then

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:51,269
you are able to access some functions

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:57,390
exposed from our node for example if we

00:09:51,269 --> 00:10:02,459
would go to our node rapid if you can

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:06,860
try and find like mobile and here there

00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:12,839
are a couple of entry points for example

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:17,790
you can you can get proposals that means

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,520
connecting as previously was stated your

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,470
consumer up you're calling that API and

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,500
go going to discovery getting proposals

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:29,820
from providers and showing the list of

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,730
those proposals so that's and then you

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:37,290
have one binary application it's it's

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:39,449
works very nice the may be limited for

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,970
that is but you need to build native

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:45,029
applications and for those people who

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,209
would like to build not exactly native

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,699
application or they are not able to use

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:55,079
static linking in their software we do

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:59,399
have API restful type of API we call it

00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:02,310
tequila API we will provide more like

00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:06,920
links to all those documentation but

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:08,990
there is a tequila API documentation

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,000
were

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:17,090
you like in general when you're running

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,320
note software it's on localhost on earth

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:27,650
1450 its exposes this API where you can

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:32,010
get session status you can get

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:36,690
identification things your current

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:40,110
connection like it's it's it's fairly

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:44,580
easy it's as you usually use any api's

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,800
it just will run in the same node and to

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,570
help people to understand how to work

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:55,800
with that because our strategy is to

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,710
build layered solution so we as a team

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,500
would like to work on base layer main

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:06,390
components as a node itself at the

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,460
discovery service and we are hoping and

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,460
we are building also in fully in

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:15,120
infrastructure layer so some kind of

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:19,440
filters or this account like this hürmüz

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,170
hub for payment solution and user

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,070
applications ideally it should be built

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,620
as we envision by other people so we are

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,460
providing to reference implementations

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,890
as our Android application and our

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:40,100
[Music]

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,100
working now on desktop application one

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:53,460
yeah this mysterium network mysterium

00:12:47,790 --> 00:13:00,030
the VPN desktop application which has

00:12:53,460 --> 00:13:02,340
some instructions how it works and I dia

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,200
is that you can spin up either

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:10,920
electronic occasion in our case we are

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:13,020
using node QT like the JavaScript labor

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,320
library which is true

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,920
and help you to build QT interfaces with

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,560
JavaScript when this application is

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:27,660
starting it's also in background running

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,030
the mysterium node protest and so it's a

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,740
desktop app which is running node

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,220
protest and it's running one more

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,960
protest we call supervisor it's it's

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,340
it's background protest which is

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,520
checking if itself is up or down it can

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,330
if something is happening with this node

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,210
protest

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:52,400
supervisor will try to launch it again

00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:57,510
so that your UI would have the access to

00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,450
to your like to the node itself all the

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,940
time and finally its approve could be

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:07,050
builded as binary and provided to

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:10,290
end-user as a binary so there are some

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:16,500
documentation how it works and it's

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:19,770
built with react user interface fairly

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,130
easy to read code for people who usually

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:26,160
use react because you can see all the

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,430
logic how it's using maybe you will have

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,080
to learn this react node god GUI which

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,390
is a little bit different than electron

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,180
but for people who would like to spin

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,510
off any kind of different things that

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,360
could be very good also a reference

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:50,070
implementation how to build on top of

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:52,200
mysterium network yes and I would like

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,660
to explain a little bit more how our

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,790
payments works and why this way not

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:03,150
another so the the problem of block

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,120
change entry payments like in in such a

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:10,800
solution as mysterium you have providers

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,080
and consumers and it's not very possible

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,090
that consumer will pay in front for

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,450
provider because they don't know each

00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,730
other

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,640
so if consumer would pay a subscription

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,170
for one month for the network providers

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,440
could just disappear and get his money

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,430
if you will pay one hour in front you

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,220
can just disappear

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:32,790
but also provider is not able to give

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,830
you service within like not getting

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,590
payment so if provider would say okay

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:40,860
connect to me after you will finish your

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:43,200
session you don't pay me it's also not

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,750
true because then consumer can disappear

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,760
and provider will never get payment so

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:53,400
we have to charge really often at the

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,650
moment we are charging each minute so

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,720
providers are trying to charge each mean

00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:02,880
minute for consumer and what we are

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:05,790
talking about charging we mean the mean

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:12,180
that we are charging super small amounts

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:15,290
like 0.005 cent if that would be USB

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:19,500
amount so it's super small transactions

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:22,380
but chains are cool secure censorship

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,600
resistant open permission is APA but

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,810
that would be totally impossible for us

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,820
to use it people also is not an option

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,160
because they are charging 25 cents per

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,650
transaction so we needed something and

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,870
like blockchain would be too slow like

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,450
you need settlement time and we need

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,810
like instant settlement so it's like you

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:46,790
can wait a couple of seconds but not

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:49,710
more because when I look on some others

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,620
solutions some of them deciding to go

00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:55,280
with the strategy that our app is main

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,440
app and everyone should use that up

00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,630
mysterium is more like a theorem itself

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,730
as a foundation and our like in theorem

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,490
you're using different wallets they are

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,280
building core node and people are

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:12,120
jumping into that by building wallets

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,730
and with VPN it's surprisingly but

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,160
already when monetizable because people

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,220
are spending billions of dollars yearly

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,560
on VPN services mysterium has been

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,380
running with this larger can't be sensor

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,080
challenge I think since the beginning of

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:32,460
March and it goes to about mid-april and

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,040
so this will there's 10,000 in cash

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,540
prizes total and it has these six

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,000
categories that I think we kind of

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,350
touched on briefly but I would recommend

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,450
checking that out

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,280
if you're curious and then for funding

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,380
in the future we have five different

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,380
challenges that are very similar pretty

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,000
much based off those same prompts but at

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,580
the end of this two-week event so on

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,410
March 30th will the steering will be

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,929
giving out one Heath for the winner of

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,419
each of these challenges so whoever has

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,789
the best project in this two-week period

00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:05,400
but on top of that then you can continue

00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:08,429
working on it for another two weeks and

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,970
actually have a shot at the full $5,000

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:14,760
what one of the sources which if you're

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,020
working like we will be updating and you

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:26,010
can get that Doc's Mysterium Network

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:30,140
also our github our github is could be

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:34,530
very useful solution so that's a note

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,799
wrapper and reference implementation of

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:40,980
new VPN mobile and steering the p.m.

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,539
desktop for those who would like to look

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,370
on how it works

00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:49,200
that's solutions which check look how

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,720
they were so please jump into our dis

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,610
cords euros always in this score we've

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,130
got a bunch of our cord development team

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,659
in this cord ask questions over there as

00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,940
you run into roadblocks we're here to

00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:02,460
help we want to hear your ideas we want

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,230
to understand what you see is potential

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,230
with our network of nodes

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,410
