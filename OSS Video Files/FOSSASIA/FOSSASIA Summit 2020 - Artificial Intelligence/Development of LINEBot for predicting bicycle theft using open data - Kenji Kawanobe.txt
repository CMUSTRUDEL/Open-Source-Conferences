	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,879
hello everyone three days first as the

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,360
air how is it

00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:12,420
enjoy super thank you for coming to my

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,320
session today let's enjoy it today

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,960
without worrying about corner virus I

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,980
hope you enjoyed my presentation okay

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,449
start my speech

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,630
at first I talk about myself hello

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,910
everyone I'm Kench caliber software

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,520
engineer at Japan system laboratory in

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,610
Japan recently I am studying dead

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,969
science and Python jungle future years

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,500
for ever's my line boat to be explained

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,809
this time was developed during the story

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,050
so next I explained about my company was

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,550
it Japan system Laboratory company I

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:58,469
call my company JSL and JC is an IT

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,440
company located in Nagano Prefecture in

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,040
Japan my company provide is a free

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,450
community space called equal level

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,210
Nagano is a very nice place surrounded

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,799
by nature so if you can't renege on oh

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,170
please come to get Grabow in my company

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,340
so now that my self introduction is over

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:23,689
I talk about Reinbold line is a message

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,540
application released by line cooperation

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:32,130
almost all Japanese use Ryan I think it

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:37,229
is like what's up a next X I explained

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,869
overview of my line but my line bought

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,619
predicted if your bike will be stolen

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,220
and predict back saved by using copy

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,570
data with Stone people in Nagano and

00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:53,970
using it using the use of the data

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:57,210
gathering from line this line body is a

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,340
safety school to predict back saved the

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,490
safety school is also accurate orbit is

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,099
present presentation I will explain such

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:10,500
detailed writer by using this line board

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,870
you can now inbounds if the price is

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,810
self or danger if I'm bought project

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,620
that the price is danger stop parking

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,620
your bike and if safe you can practice

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,909
out worrying about your bike

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,980
this will help you about the

00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:32,590
consequences over your bike theft next I

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,670
will explain how to use both why prank

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:40,299
video of us let's study sports as

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:46,420
friends and then some age you are age

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:49,090
and you outpatient your age and your

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,500
occupation it can be sent very easily

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,450
because it does not use a keyboard so

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,379
next if you want to know safety school

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,280
of your bike

00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:03,450
press calculate button after that it

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,989
sends a lock status and location data

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:12,090
and this we calculate the safety school

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:14,920
immediately yes

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:20,230
next I explain the configuration diagram

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:25,329
of my system so this is it of my system

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:29,379
I deployed the jungle on health database

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:34,900
uses PostgreSQL line message API is

00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:38,290
useful message in line this API is

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,810
released by line corporation it enables

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,519
two ways communication between system

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,519
and line users it has push message and

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:52,150
response message push message is that

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,389
system send message to users and the

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,569
prime message is that user send message

00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:04,209
to system and system reprise message to

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:07,000
user so my system uses lip fry message

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:10,569
and listen to explanation of

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,720
complication diagram okay

00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:19,120
first jump you don't forget user data

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:22,360
with using that message API and then so

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,900
user data is stored in database by bio

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,900
model

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:34,110
and then when all that it ordered to

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,110
calculate self school pieces of pie

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,169
calculate it from user data and open

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:47,340
data with store people for predicting

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:53,150
theft bike and then send the calculated

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,150
safety school to user by messaging API

00:04:53,389 --> 00:05:03,060
so but what is safety school next I

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:05,220
explained detail of safety school the

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,710
safety school is degree of similarity

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:13,620
store people and a user high safety

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,740
school indicated that the user data is

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:23,720
not shimmer at the futures of stolen

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:27,810
people it means safe on the other hand

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,330
lost every school indicators user data

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:35,340
it is shimmer of the features or stolen

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:38,070
people it means danger this time to

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:43,140
calculate service school I use

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:45,690
Mahalanobis distance it can be

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:52,229
calculated from the main bure self dead

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:55,229
set and baryons compiles or dead set it

00:05:52,229 --> 00:06:00,870
is number that indicates how far from

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:05,220
how far a point is a from the dataset so

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,890
we press a point with a user and the

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,860
press data set with open data with the

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:14,510
store people therefore indicating how

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:18,030
far a user is from open data it's

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:25,200
indicating how similar a user earned

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:28,140
strong people from gzb that I use

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,860
Mohandas digit a Mahalanobis distance to

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:34,409
calculate safety school let's take a

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,710
closer look at the detail of the open

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,710
data to use calculation of safety school

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,310
so this is open data with storm people

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,580
published on the website of noggin

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:56,550
prefecture so there are 1496 cases of

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:59,940
bugs EFT in 2018 the open data has

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:04,410
several columns for example as my spell

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:08,550
called allocation page ogre time and age

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:14,190
occupation or tall people and block

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:19,830
stages this time use using columns to

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:26,820
calculate safe school oka date and okay

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:31,380
time stone people age occupation unlock

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:35,180
the status of bike so then I use it okay

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:39,030
location next to Inc is a bit annoying

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:46,200
because I must test at them these

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:50,010
columns is not only numerical data have

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,410
a character data oh my god there's only

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:56,490
Japanese word in occupation comes

00:07:52,410 --> 00:08:00,900
I forgot that I am Japanese it cannot be

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,729
used for calculation as is so let's

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,870
death touch work on creating safety

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:13,410
school I used to project our notebook to

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:17,370
death touch this open data a first lid

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:21,510
open data currents not used this time in

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,320
the way so date them it is difficult to

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:30,030
program if coms names depends Japanese

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:32,930
so replace them with English it became a

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,930
little easier to see

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:41,960
next the start is a lock column check

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,960
the category value in the car

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,490
this means

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:51,060
locked on the other hand this means not

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,250
locked so the press lock to be is wrong

00:08:51,060 --> 00:09:00,810
and not locked

00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:05,370
with zero that it is age occupation

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:09,089
counts in the same way vegetales this

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:12,810
girl's in concrete term check the

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:17,810
category it phrase category and these

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:20,850
diets so about orchid each time explain

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:25,740
one amassed data are extracted from

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:30,449
orchid age and then distaste and okay

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:34,529
time or converge to a number about

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:36,660
location data explain I added a latitude

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:39,389
and longitude column by using

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,750
accessibility calling service that

00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:50,930
convert others data comes to latitude

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,930
and longitude here is desert the desert

00:09:51,290 --> 00:10:01,829
no chapter no Japanese words it's a

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:07,069
Korea some before so my system uses that

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:07,069
open data has been detached in advance

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:18,240
so next I explain how to code for

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:22,459
calculating safety school as I said area

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,819
I use my harvest distance at first

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:30,439
prepare mean vector the mean vector is

00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:33,509
calculated including the user data so

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:36,589
also usually they also end of the open

00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:40,319
data by the way this user data is an

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:43,079
arbitrary value and lyricist and that is

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:49,709
a barrier of change from line or stall

00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:53,250
in the day be a next great constants for

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:56,160
cars and loads then calculates the

00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:01,790
average parry for each come using for

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,790
loop mean vector has been calculated

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:12,450
eggs iCal courage variance covariance so

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,650
to calculate that value first create a

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:23,010
vector of user data - mean vector then

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:26,970
assign that Vario by a variable div and

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:30,840
transpose that vector if you use you use

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:34,880
numpy swap parks or park sisk you can

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:39,120
calculate transpose vector in one line

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:44,160
then much fried Salisbury and divide by

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:52,590
number of loads this is point is that

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:55,710
this is print result now that bias

00:11:52,590 --> 00:12:01,440
covariance has been calculated next

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:03,960
calculate Mahalanobis first calculates

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,930
the impasse matrix of variance

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:13,080
covariance then but pride that inverse

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,070
matrix and the picture of use of data -

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,930
min becsher

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:22,040
a scientist value to variable bar the

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:28,440
next much fried that variable and

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:30,690
transpose dot vector finally the

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,420
Mahatma's distance is calculated by

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:40,140
taking the square root of this value the

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,340
Mohandas value this time is eight point

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,340
seven nine this time the user data set

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:51,080
arbitrary is that okay chair is 20 p.m.

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:54,510
mass is disabled as is twenties

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:59,720
occupation is full it means working

00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:06,570
adult locked status is 1 it means locked

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:10,770
etc as an experiment I set the age only

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:15,520
to sorry and calculated a safety score

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:19,810
the score increased a little so

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:24,070
ng 6h only 260 the score increased

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:27,280
considerably since this results I create

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:32,200
a curve to observe the change in the

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:36,690
safety school by Mahana bees this graph

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:43,090
shows safety school by Muhammad's for

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:46,030
1496 touring people in open data looking

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:50,920
at the features of people with low

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:54,850
safety school I found that there are a

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:58,720
lot of teens and twenties then sometime

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:04,600
a lot of 7:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. and they

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,430
under that day is many Friday on the

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,970
other hand looking at the features of

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:17,020
people with high safety schools I found

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:19,330
that they a lot of 60s and 70s the

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:25,750
relation between bags EFT and this

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:29,230
feature is leery right so I checked open

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,960
data I use this term but it is difficult

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:36,940
to find the features if the inter table

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:45,010
has is so I visualize them so that

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:49,390
creature can be easily searched yes I

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:53,170
created some girls this time i will

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:58,930
explain features and trends found from

00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:01,180
these two graphs first this graph so

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:05,290
this graph shows number of stone people

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,140
by age occupation from this graph I

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:11,020
found that number of teens and twenties

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:16,720
were some bike is auto sad over the

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:21,150
whole on the other hand number 60s and

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,150
sympathies were also bug is very small

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,690
next I explained graph in the lower

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,690
flight

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,970
it is graph called heat map this graph

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:39,230
shows number of stone people by time on

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:43,520
the day the basket exceeds its time and

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:48,080
the horizontal axis is day deep colored

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:51,520
area means a high number of safeties the

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,250
point sounded by red circle is deep cold

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:59,510
so check the time and a time in the

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:04,360
point are 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. at 18:00

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:09,950
p.m. say committing hours in Japan and

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:13,910
eighteen PM is go home awards next

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:21,110
please look at the day so they in the

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:25,370
point is mainly Friday as a result over

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,430
a week in the graph I found that I found

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,710
that stone people has several features

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:34,640
most of the store people are teens and

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:38,570
twenties 60s and 70s but is difficult to

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:43,120
be stolen and meeting hours

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,120
go home hours mainly Friday

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,800
the futures a safety school by

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:54,650
Muhammad's had judged danger eat almost

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:59,210
matched Richards our open data this

00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:02,120
Caracas danger so that I use the safety

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:08,209
school by Mohandas for predicting back

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:11,660
served finally conclusion there are

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,939
several features of people's own bike my

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:19,100
line body is open data which storing

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:21,860
people they can predict except in open

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:26,449
data with store people many younger are

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:29,390
still bike but I guess that the younger

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:32,720
people buy more high performance Park so

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:35,420
that to improve the accuracy of observed

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,010
school so openly the should have data

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:41,680
about bike that bring me to user and oh

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:46,680
