hi everyone my name is Ian and I'm an

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,849
RPA engineer at a is Singapore working

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,900
on tech you I tag UI is a command-line

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:17,010
RP a tool that's easy to use

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:20,150
- i automates processes for you and each

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,550
automated workflow is called a flow

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,769
these flows are just text files with

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,720
instructions so they're easy to write

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:33,090
open understand and to use now let's

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,200
look at a few flows to watch tech UI in

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,829
action you can see here I have three

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,910
flows on my desktop these I have saved

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,440
and deployed as double clickable flows

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,260
it's really really easy to do this and

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,680
we'll look at how to do it later for now

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,800
let's watch what flows do the first one

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,879
update temperature is related to a

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,899
current called in 19 cities a ssin and

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:08,970
US requires us to lock our temperature

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:12,119
twice daily in two separate portals one

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,360
of these is behind a login wall so it

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,640
can be a bit cumbersome to do this

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,700
multiple times a day and visit two

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,299
separate links so we wrote a simple flow

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,030
to update both sides or inputting of

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,240
temperature just once let's look at how

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,240
it works

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,790
so double clicking the flow runs 10 UI

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,340
which opens Chrome automatically of

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,040
course Chrome needs to be installed yet

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,689
asks us for temperature in Celsius or

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,869
just state 36.4 press enter it comes to

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,030
a login page in u.s. here I've really

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:57,229
felt in my details and it will key in

00:01:51,030 --> 00:02:00,509
the details based on what I still did

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,579
when the flow goes to the login page it

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,460
will check whether I'm already logged in

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:09,060
if I'm already logged in it will skip

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,440
the login steps of course it's clever

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,840
enough to do that

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,530
now it go opens another session of

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,010
chrome so that I can go to Google sheets

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:26,230
and from here I'll go and search for my

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:29,230
correct row and update the correct

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,850
column and that's it we've obeyed that

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:37,510
both sides with a simple flow in tangu I

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:41,730
let's look at the next flow Forex

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:46,450
gmail.com items when I double click this

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:50,890
basically I'm going to go to a page on

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:56,410
DBS website to get a lot to get a list

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:58,090
of exchange rates for that day this is a

00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,740
very common situation in the law of

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,760
manufacturing companies where they

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:06,850
record down the exchange rates for the

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,670
day to use in their daily costing so I

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,590
will go to that page copy down all of

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:18,040
the exchange rates save it into a CSV

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:22,690
and email it to an email address let's

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:26,500
look at it in action again it opens

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:30,190
Chrome note that not all floors need to

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,400
use Chrome and you can specify it not to

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,010
open Chrome as well so we have gone to

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,220
this web page and then we can see in the

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:44,770
background then the tag UI is reading

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,510
each row and writing it into a CSV it

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:52,209
counts the number of rows in the table

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:56,400
looks through each row a writes it as a

00:03:52,209 --> 00:04:03,700
row in a CSV now it opens Chrome again

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:05,860
visiting Gmail and it's going to send an

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,310
email based on the steps there we have

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,310
programmed

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,880
and that's none now you can look at the

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,150
result of the flow

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,900
yes numbers dot CSV and yeah all

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,540
exchange rates all saved automatically

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,600
of course this force can be scheduled to

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,010
run daily at a certain time it's really

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,340
easy and we'll look at how to do this

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,340
later

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:44,680
the last flow here is letter flow what

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,190
is gonna do is open a Microsoft Word

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,800
document and this Microsoft Word

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,400
document is basically a template with a

00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:00,540
few you could say fields that need to be

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:04,210
filled in based on certain information

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:08,080
so it will update those fields based on

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:13,450
the information and print out the word

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,860
document let's look at it in action this

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,880
is going to be quite interesting because

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:25,229
it doesn't it doesn't use Chrome for

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:28,060
once and it also uses OCR on the page so

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:33,760
here it's going to look for address of

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:36,520
donor using OCR then it's going to use

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,130
its gonna move the mouse to address of

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,610
donor double-click it and replace it

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,720
with the correct text again it uses OCR

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:49,830
to find the donor name the text only

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,220
name so I'm just literally typing click

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:56,680
double-click don't any music OCR and

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,590
then it's doing it for me and of course

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,510
I'm just printing into one note here and

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:08,590
that's done that's what we have for tell

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:11,620
you why samples so we've just witnessed

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,450
how powerful tell you I can be and these

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,510
are just a few simple flows to

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,570
demonstrate the capabilities of 10 UI

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:22,180
now let's look at the actual flow text

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,840
files behind these floats and see how

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,840
simple it is

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:33,979
the first one update tempo tag we can

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,599
open this riff any kind of text editor

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm just going to be using

00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:43,129
yes code Visual Studio code because when

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:47,509
it's what I normally use anyway this

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:50,240
here is the entire flow it's pretty

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:55,099
compact and you can see that a lot of

00:06:50,240 --> 00:07:00,469
the syntax is really simple first thing

00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:04,370
we can look at your each row in this

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:07,930
flow and in general in 10 UI flows are

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,930
divided into steps each line is

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:15,310
generally a step the name of the step is

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:18,770
the first way yeah and if what is asked

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,930
so it's the ask step and after that we

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,069
have a space and this is what we want to

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:28,279
ask this here we're just gonna prompt

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:33,919
the user for text input that's where and

00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:36,620
ten 36.4 and then now when I'm after it

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,819
prompts for text input that input will

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:44,599
be saved as ask underscore result this

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:46,909
second line is just to say we're gonna

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:50,270
create a new variable which is called

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:52,969
user temp and we're gonna call it we can

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,979
assign the value of asked result just to

00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:58,759
make it just give it a better name user

00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:05,449
temperature now I'm just gonna visit

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:09,500
then the URL of the NUS pato so that we

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:12,710
can do our daily declaration here the

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,860
step here involves just pasting the

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,690
entire URL check you is man enough to

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,539
detect that this is a URL and I should

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,310
visit it

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:26,960
now here's for how we write our if

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:30,050
statement if exist username here is

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,180
where we are checking that there is an

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:37,670
element that looks like username in the

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:42,350
current web page if there is that means

00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:45,620
hey we are at the login page we need to

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,510
log in if we don't see this page it

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,290
means we're already logged in from a

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:55,340
previous session yeah we can see type

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,520
username s what

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:04,820
so type username is the name of the

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:07,910
element in the webpage and this is what

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,670
you want to type in test and this

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,250
username here is saved locally on my

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,700
computer it's a variable that's safe

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,220
locally and this is useful because this

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,830
is this allows us to share this flow

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,690
very easily of others without having to

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,020
share our username and password of

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,750
course right these variables are stored

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,130
in a file call thank you why local dot

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:38,360
CSD you can see it here thank you I look

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:41,660
good a CSV can update it with your local

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,060
variables yeah again we type the

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,660
temperature this is the name of the

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,210
field element input element on the

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:58,130
webpage and you can see how simple it is

00:09:50,210 --> 00:10:01,520
really yeah the if Clause all this these

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,430
two steps yeah within the block of the

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,730
if Clause so they will only happen if we

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:12,890
are blocked by the login page

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,840
we have the key book step the cable step

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,960
lets us interact directly with the

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,930
keyboard here we are holding Windows key

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,720
and pressing R this lets us easily run

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,990
any other applications for example here

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,010
we do windows r type chromeless enter is

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:34,700
easy way to open applications in Windows

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,420
although technique also works on Mac and

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,540
Linux

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:43,460
it's cross-platform yeah we can see that

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,520
a lot of this automation is simply

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,700
keyboard interactions using shortcuts we

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,570
fill in the URL address with ctrl L

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:56,100
allowing us to enter that you

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,920
in the webpage and then we after we get

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,900
to the webpage we control F to look file

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:07,160
name and then press write a number of

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:11,390
times so that we can enter our

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,850
temperature in the correct error column

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:24,740
and that's it let's look at the next

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:27,870
floor it's going to be 4x Gmail okay

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:32,070
yeah this one is a little bit longer but

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:35,340
no more complicated again yeah from the

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:42,060
stack we are going to visit the URL of

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:45,080
the DBS exchange rates page this dump

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,850
step allows us to create a new file and

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,880
it's going to write this into the file

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:55,680
it's gonna write currency comma rate

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,610
into a file called numbers dot CSV this

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,340
just creates the column headers for a

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,100
CSV file as you know a CSV file is a

00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,230
comma separated values file so to calm a

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,600
comma here you notice that currency is

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:14,460
the first column rate is the second

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:19,260
column next we are going to count the

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:21,810
number of rows in this page in this page

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:28,350
and this is number of rows in the

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:31,020
foreign exchange rate table and I inside

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,780
this count function we have an XPath

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,120
some of you probably be familiar this

00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:40,050
already this is a very common and

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:46,410
expressive powerful way to identify web

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:50,280
elements on a web page so here we have X

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,830
path expression which is the number of

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:57,420
roles you can see TR if any of you are

00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:00,000
familiar with HTML TRS and table rules

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,800
and we are counting the table rows and

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,070
we'll assign that to the node to the

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,459
variable rules so now we're going to

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,879
look

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:12,269
through the rows and we're going to look

00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:16,139
through this number of times based on

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:20,519
the ball count and then each time we're

00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:24,240
gonna call it the variable row now we

00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:29,279
have the read step this basically looks

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:33,480
at the web page reads and elements text

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,749
or attribute to a variable so here we're

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,160
gonna look for this XPath and we're

00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:44,660
going to get the value and store it into

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,449
the variable called currency the second

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:52,499
value we're going to store it into the

00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:57,540
variable called rate and now they're

00:13:52,499 --> 00:14:01,910
simply going to assign and this this

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:07,920
these values and put them into an array

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:10,499
into a list and call it Forex rate next

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,929
we're going to simply write this whole

00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:17,929
4x rate as a CSV roll into the combustor

00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:20,699
CSV that we created earlier

00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:23,929
kingdom-based dot CSV is the one we

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:29,660
created earlier right just append this

00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:35,129
text as a new row in the previous file

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:38,579
then we just go into create to open up

00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:40,410
another instance of Chrome why we open

00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:46,189
it another instance of Chrome here is

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:48,689
because Google blocks some automations

00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:53,369
some services when you are using

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:55,410
automated automated browser so for

00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:57,059
example Gmail sometimes you won't be

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,089
able to access it with an automated

00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:03,869
browser this was a recent change by

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:07,279
Gmail and we had to adapt to it so now

00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:14,189
we open a Gmail in a separate browser

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:17,549
then we click on compose dot PNG was

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,320
composed of PNG and go back here compose

00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,710
a PNG is a foul

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,520
image of screen shot well what I won't

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,380
tell you either click on it we'll use

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,440
image recognition on the current screen

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,170
so this is visual automation it's gonna

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,600
look for anything that looks a very high

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,340
percentage similar to this and it's

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,650
going to go to the middle of any cricket

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:47,540
to compose a new email we click it we

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:51,960
wait for a second we type an email the

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:57,180
kind of email subject we click attach

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:59,340
and then we attach our follow you attach

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,540
a file and we can send it using keyboard

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:09,980
shortcuts pretty simple let's go to the

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:12,960
last flow that's going to be letter flow

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:19,920
we are going to use OCR as mentioned

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:24,990
earlier we open the template document

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,640
again and this is the path to the

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,780
template document we're going to put it

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,680
onto the clipboard then we paste it in

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:40,490
our run command and press Enter as we

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:46,680
see here next we have the widt command

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:49,170
we wait for a few seconds and here we

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:55,650
have a double click your double click

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:59,550
the address of donor using OCR so how

00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,890
this works is tag you I will look at the

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,070
current screen it will scan the entire

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:09,510
screen for text turn this entire screen

00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:12,540
image into text it detects text that

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:16,020
matches address of donor and it goes to

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,850
the location and double click Save then

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,770
after that we will just replace it with

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,209
one two three automation lane it does

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,939
the same for daughter name in total

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:27,420
amount and here we can do the rest with

00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:30,630
keyboard shortcuts really really really

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,560
simple but you can see how powerful the

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,560
OCR

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:41,960
feature of clicking and finding

00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:46,769
locations on your screen just based on

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:49,470
text can be how powerful it can be next

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,970
we look at how to install tank UI for

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,179
yourself so you can get started with

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:57,869
tell you I here's the documentation is

00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:01,759
for thank you I it's on read the docs

00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:04,460
dot IO and you just simply go to

00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,840
installation on the left hand side and

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,279
it gives you installation instructions

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,679
for Windows or Mac or Linux since I'm on

00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:19,279
Windows you can just click here it gives

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:22,489
you the direct link to the zip file next

00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:28,409
we want to unzip this file to see drive

00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:31,080
directly on to see Drive we have to also

00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,659
install our dependencies there are two

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:38,039
dependencies here for Windows the first

00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:40,409
one is open JDK and if you click here it

00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:44,389
is packaged for you if you're using a

00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:48,869
flavor of open JDK called Amazon careto

00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:49,950
it's completely free the next thing we

00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,359
have to install is Chrome

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,840
most probably you already have this

00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:57,029
installed so that should be fine so then

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:02,399
once we're done with that we just need

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:05,249
to open our command prompt and if since

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:07,169
this is me simple everyone we also have

00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,549
instructions on how to do this almost

00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,159
like you know you know how to do this

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:19,379
already so we can open our command

00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:28,190
prompt and then we can add tecnu I sauce

00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:31,979
to our path with this and then we can

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:35,599
run our first flow so this is our first

00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:35,599
flow ok we can run it

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,090
if it starts properly without an error

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,110
name is you have in stock that you I

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:51,680
properly so here the first sample flow

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:58,620
goes to latest movies it waits a bit and

00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:00,480
snaps a screenshot of the image of the

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:12,210
results it's just a really really simple

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:17,210
flow if you have any problems with that

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:20,070
you can go to having problems and then

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,650
check whether these problems are

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:27,170
applicable to yourself if not you can

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:32,600
also come to our github page and then

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:34,770
post an issue on our github issues page

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,640
and that's it for the installation

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:42,030
really really simple again here the

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:48,260
Amazon careto is a Installer you can

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:52,290
just click through and you I windows

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:55,830
it's just a zip file and you can extract

00:20:52,290 --> 00:21:01,890
this directly onto C Drive directly onto

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:04,590
C Drive to be just like that now that we

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,620
have set up tank UI we have seen how

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:12,150
easy it is to to do that and now we're

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:15,300
gonna write our first flow we go to file

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:19,590
explorer and we never get to the C Drive

00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:22,490
tantui floors folder this is where we

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,170
recommend you write all of your floors

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:30,890
you can separate them into different

00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,890
folders so let me have my first floor

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:37,580
and then I'm gonna create a new file I'm

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:43,160
gonna have a text document I'm gonna

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:46,190
call it first flow da ta G I'll change

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,510
the extension to dot ta g because

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:55,600
although all flow files and text files

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:58,640
we require dot PNG extension at the end

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,240
okay now I'm just going to open this

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,040
with Visual Studio code the escort

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,690
although you can use whatever text

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,690
editor you like even notepad

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,580
okay now we have open our flow we need

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,780
to think about what we want to do with

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:21,590
this so how about for a simple stat we

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:26,510
can go to a web page and click around

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:32,030
the web page just like that look at how

00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:35,330
we can do that so why not we just come

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:43,340
to the documentation page and this is

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:44,570
our documentation URL oh I copy it and

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm gonna paste it yeah

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:51,440
so that means thank you I will come to

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:56,300
this page and then and from here we want

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:59,390
a qi to click on main concepts just like

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:03,520
that as a simple first flow so how do we

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:07,670
get tight UI to click on main concepts

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:11,660
as I mentioned earlier on tecnu I can

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:16,010
read elements and web elements on a web

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,560
page using the Dom using XPath but it

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,610
also has more intuitive and simple

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,460
systems to try to identify the elements

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:29,060
so here if we just do click main

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:34,880
concepts it should work now I'll talk

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:38,270
about why later concepts and they will

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,150
do week 5 so that we can see to make

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,850
sure that it works and now let's run

00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,509
this flow

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:50,679
when we do click main concepts Tech you

00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:53,350
I will look for the entire look through

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,559
the entire DOM and look for any elements

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:59,200
where it has a name that looks like main

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,710
concepts or a class that looks like beam

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,289
concepts or idea looks like main

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,570
concepts or even a text that looks like

00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:11,139
main concepts and it will try to click

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:14,799
on that so here let's run it so how

00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:18,759
would we run this flow let's go to our

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:23,940
command prompt go CMD

00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:30,820
I believe we have we have it in C Drive

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:35,500
tech UI / flows / my first hello and

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:41,830
I'll just go attack UI first flow dot

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:45,330
txt and now it opens Chrome as we expect

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:49,330
it it goes to the web page and it will

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:52,899
click on main concepts so tell you I was

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:56,289
able to look for main concepts identify

00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:59,259
and click it of course this flow is not

00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:01,029
very useful but it's just a simple as

00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:04,059
first of all that we can do the

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:10,179
demonstrates is clicking and using the

00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:13,090
web browser question is not how do we

00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:18,460
deploy this flow as the shortcut so we

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:23,409
can simply double click it to run to do

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:26,769
that we just do 10 UI first flow tank if

00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:31,120
a dash D this is the deploy option we

00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:36,730
can also do - deploy and we do that we

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:41,279
generated our first floor dot CMD and we

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:44,200
can move this first block CMD to our

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,580
desktop and now we can double click this

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:54,890
to run our flow

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:59,580
simple as that and can see that it looks

00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,330
alright and it's great to finish in a

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,220
few seconds

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:07,380
yep now this is probably a good time for

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,150
us to look through the documentation of

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:14,910
tech you I tell you is a version six

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,290
just released and with it we have a

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:21,150
brand new documentation or read the docs

00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,340
in on top of the installation

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,130
instructions we also go through the beam

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,760
concepts of tech you I advanced concepts

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,560
and a reference of all the steps run

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,110
options and other helpful functions that

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,900
we can use okay so let's look at what

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:42,630
some of these look like so we go show

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:49,080
the flows we also have the gifs showing

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:52,170
the demonstrations of each feature and

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:57,440
then here we have showing you how to use

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,440
the deploy file that they deploy option

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,450
and as you can see here if you move your

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,210
flow to another folder then you need to

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:10,190
create a new shortcut file too we just

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:15,180
do the deploy option again the also-ran

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:19,890
flows from online from a URL online like

00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:24,270
just here you can run the flow from the

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:27,660
sample flow from online you can random

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,850
thank you I am without the browser

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,270
we've hit last one as using a browser

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:36,210
but in invisible browser can do that in

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:39,720
Hitler's phone oh here we are the steps

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:42,770
and it goes to how to use all the steps

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:47,400
and the most common steps like click

00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:49,610
visit type we only went through some of

00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,610
the

00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:59,790
features and steps early on so here we

00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,080
can see more the documentation here we

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,440
can see examples

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,240
click getting started yep so again we

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,870
are looking for getting started as the

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:14,490
ID name class title or even getting

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:16,890
started in the earth text well so we can

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:22,140
also provide you the full XPath which is

00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:25,140
expressive way and a very certain way to

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,160
click on certain elements we can also

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,160
click on coordinates of the screen

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,590
although this is a fresh our method of

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,740
clicking on elements because sometimes

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:42,210
elements can move around based on text

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:45,170
boxes text text being longer or shorter

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:48,030
or website is just changing they are

00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:52,490
interface but this is also a possibility

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:56,160
to click on points based on coordinates

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:58,910
we can also click based on images like

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,300
what we saw the demonstration earlier

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:05,280
here we have visited web page type this

00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:09,150
is very common we want to type something

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,220
into into web input so this is the name

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:17,040
of the input and we will type some text

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:19,680
into it continue on we can see the

00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,240
different types of identifiers so these

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:27,060
are XPath this Dom click on points here

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,570
we also have regions identifiers

00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:33,450
identify just a way for us to identify

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:38,040
what we want the step to work on so here

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:43,440
we can do read and this is a region 300

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:47,220
400 to 500 550 that means we can look at

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,740
the region between points 300 400 as XY

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,670
coordinates on the screen to another

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,830
point which is with 500 550 and within

00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:59,220
the rectangle bounded by these points

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:02,370
we're going to OCR all the text there

00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,700
and save the text to a variable

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:09,870
so this can be very useful to look to

00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,179
read documents which are scanned in so

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:15,169
we had some companies or so they scanned

00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:19,650
in some documents and you want to match

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:24,870
invoices or other reports make sure they

00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:29,039
match up so they also use this OCR

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:31,350
reading okay

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,690
we also have live mode which is an

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,480
excellent way to test out and develop

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:40,110
your own flows basically it is an

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:44,010
interpreter for 10 UI so you can just

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:48,029
type in steps and then it will execute

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:50,789
each step line by line and yeah you'll

00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:52,260
execute all the steps like my name so

00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:56,809
you can test what works and what doesn't

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:59,399
work if statements bla bla bla

00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:01,440
yes helper functions these are basically

00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,590
JavaScript functions that we can use you

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,679
know

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,480
thank you I floss thank you is still

00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,000
under active development so we're

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,220
constantly trying to improve the API and

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,250
make it easier easier for users to use

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,649
tell you why to write your flows some

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,039
other things in that's possible with

00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:26,970
tell you I include using data tables so

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,549
here data tables there basically CSV

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,100
files it allows us to run the flow

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,559
multiple times we can have a CSV file

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:38,460
with a thousand rows and evolve ruin it

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,029
will run our flow one thousand times one

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:46,140
time for each row in the CSV file that

00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:48,690
we specify so we just run it with tank

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,210
UI with my flow tank and then the name

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:57,210
of the data table this is the data table

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:59,850
entry data dot CSV yep and then you were

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:04,649
running with these variable values at

00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:06,929
the variable username bopi test account

00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:10,230
password will be blah blah blah and so

00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:14,260
on so forth you can also run other flows

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,780
within flows and a lot more

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,510
so if you when you want to learn more

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,220
about tech you I and you want to figure

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,410
out what you can do and how to do a

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,450
certain thing can tell you I you want to

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,340
go to the reference this is where you

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,200
can list up all we can see all the steps

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,540
to interact with the mouse and keyboard

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,799
these are the things you can do to

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,169
interact with the web these are things

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,970
you can do so on and so forth you want

00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:41,200
to see if files these are the different

00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,549
steps that we can do one interesting

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,090
thing about tech new at all so instead

00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:53,290
you can it's very powerful in that you

00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:55,090
can integrate Python JavaScript and this

00:32:53,290 --> 00:33:00,220
visual automation library called

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:01,929
securely in the tecnu I flow itself so

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:08,020
how do we do that let's look at our

00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:11,110
examples so here if you want to run some

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:15,190
Python code we can just do py space and

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,290
some tighter statement so here we py and

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:22,510
then this is just tighten code result

00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:27,160
equals two plus three and then we we can

00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:33,490
transfer this result back to our tank UI

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:39,040
namespace I'll tell you I common runtime

00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:43,270
by printing it to the standard STD out

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:46,780
stand it up and then it when we print it

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:49,929
to standard out in Python it will be

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:54,520
saved as py result back in the tank UI

00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:57,669
runtime so that's basically it so why

00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,190
not we trying to look at a more involved

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,590
flow a more complete more complex flow

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:09,190
and write it will tell you I know that

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:10,929
we have the documentation with us so now

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:16,929
let's use the documentation to create a

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:20,440
second more complex flow yeah we have

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:23,770
faith calm it's a website that has deals

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,570
for group purchases so the deals can be

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,510
quite attractive so let's say I'm really

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,909
interested in some of these deals

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:33,730
only a certain subset of them like I

00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:36,399
only care about the ones which are one

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:41,350
for one because I want to go there with

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:44,500
my girlfriend or whatever so let's get a

00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:48,490
flow that comes to this website looks

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:52,570
for deals which I want for one and then

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:57,430
save them for me into a list right and

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,150
it will run it everything ok so how

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:06,190
would you do that

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:09,490
it's let's create first a new flow will

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:12,880
create our folder second flow and we

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:19,120
create a new flow which have a call

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:23,050
second doc eh ok again I'm gonna open

00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:27,250
this in any text editor I'm just using

00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:30,510
yes Katya and yeah first thing to do is

00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:34,110
the URL to visit yeah I copy this URL

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:39,400
and I will paste it here

00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:43,900
Thanks what I want to do is to write a

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:48,310
list of the Dukes so the easiest way to

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:52,570
do this is to create a CSV file and if

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:55,690
you solve from the earlier flow you

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:58,930
write a CSV file here right you know a

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:02,670
Forex exchange demonstration so you can

00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:07,180
just copy it and use the same framework

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:12,610
the same idea so we want to dump view

00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:20,590
and the link that's also ball right to

00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:24,010
use dot CSV we're gonna count the

00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:27,220
elements which have the deals so be each

00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:29,230
of these cuts one Katia one Katia one

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:33,760
cut yeah we're gonna count all these so

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:39,010
I'm gonna right click and inspect so it

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:42,180
looks like these elements are in the div

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,180
class column

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:50,860
and you I can't segment okay so I'm

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,870
going to use XPath to look through to

00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,520
identify these five elements and count

00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:58,980
them

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,980
so again double click to copy the class

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,370
these should be diff elements so here

00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:12,760
we're looking for all deaf elements

00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:16,960
which have the class equals to this and

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:21,460
that should be good and we're gonna call

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,240
these cuts for each cut for cut from one

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,240
two cuts

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:32,260
we're gonna read so now we're gonna look

00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:38,260
this allows us to look through all of

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:56,770
these cuts and for each kind we're going

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:59,710
to say you want to read this cut and so

00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:02,350
here cut will become from go from one

00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:05,020
two three four five six seven up to a

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:08,110
however minicars they are so out of all

00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,120
of these cut elements I want to get the

00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,410
first one then the second one that that

00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,510
wonderful wonderful fun

00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,490
these backticks will replace lift cut

00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:21,990
with you know one two three four or five

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:26,470
or whatever number the loop is in okay

00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:27,670
read from this and we read the cut but

00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,410
we don't just want to read the car gonna

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,980
read the cut and you want to go into

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:39,910
that we want to get this right which is

00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:42,920
the name of this this this offer so

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:47,180
which is under any class content

00:38:42,920 --> 00:39:00,260
so we're going to go a class equals to

00:38:47,180 --> 00:39:04,160
content /h 3 yeah that looks good and

00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,599
this will be the deal but I don't just

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,869
want to grab the deal I want to grab the

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:14,869
deal only if the view contains a 1 for 1

00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:22,750
so I'll do an if statement if new

00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:25,730
contains 1 for 1 did I spell that right

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:29,210
yeah so one for one looks like this so

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:36,019
I'll do 1 - 4 - 1 so if it contains 1

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:40,160
for 1 then I will say I want to get the

00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:50,359
link for as well so I'm going to read

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:52,160
something to link the traffic yeah I'm

00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:55,579
gonna get this link which allows me to

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,890
go to the actual deal after I've listed

00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:01,250
down all the interesting deals so this

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,960
is the actual link but it's not a

00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,559
complete link as a partial link which is

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,730
/a Singapore so we need to add on this

00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:14,839
my fav calm in the front so I'll do a

00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:17,259
copy copy from here and I'll make a note

00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:25,430
that I need to add on this my fav calm

00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:29,829
ok so for here now we're gonna do we're

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,829
gonna copy this this part yeah let's see

00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:35,200
you wrote equals 2

00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:50,070
and then we can it app on my phone calm

00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:58,080
in front of the link and now we have our

00:40:50,070 --> 00:41:07,400
duro and we can write this duro to our

00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:10,830
deal CSV I think that looks good so

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,610
again what's happening here is we go to

00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:16,290
this web page we create this new dot CSV

00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,680
with the column headings

00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:22,830
do you and link then we count the number

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,840
of cuts using XPath you can learn more

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,840
about XPath on w3schools

00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,480
XPath w3schools

00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:42,210
x yeah this is a really good link to

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:44,340
learn XPath and then from here we're

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:47,670
gonna check we're gonna assign this

00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:52,790
value to the deal and if the view

00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:57,270
contains 1 for 1 we will write the row

00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:59,540
using the deal and our link we're gonna

00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:03,420
write the row using the view on the link

00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:08,400
alright so let's do this now let's run

00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:14,970
our new flow and we'll tell you why

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:17,270
second dot tech and check whether this

00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,270
works

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,270
can't find Forex rate clearly because we

00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,360
shouldn't have a 4x3

00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:38,330
Louis from earlier on but this is now a

00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:38,330
new rule so we will try again

00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:54,140
Block B's yeah we can look at the can

00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:58,970
look here yeah it seems to be looping

00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:04,430
through the elements and okay looks like

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:07,490
it's finished in 16 seconds okay it's

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:11,270
created our CSV file and we can check

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:13,190
you oh great so we have our deals these

00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:15,800
are the view names they all contain this

00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,600
one for one which is excellent and we

00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,230
have our link here so we can follow

00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,660
business and and look for the deals of

00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,830
our dreams right well for once use my

00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,290
card I think I have this with my

00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:35,480
girlfriend tonight I'm just kidding

00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:40,390
okay so that's it we again we can deploy

00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:44,120
these this flow easily just using the D

00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:49,100
option which is the deploy option now we

00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:53,570
have this deploy option we can bring it

00:43:49,100 --> 00:44:03,560
to our desktop and we can also run this

00:43:53,570 --> 00:44:07,690
using Windows scheduler scheduler the

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:12,910
task scheduler if task scheduler we can

00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:16,310
tell task scheduler to run this task

00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,600
every day at a certain time it's pretty

00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:25,510
simple I'll just go through the basics

00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:31,130
you create a basic task check for meals

00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:35,150
daily yes occur every one days yes it's

00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:42,380
not a program yes and then I'll just say

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:45,560
please open second stop and then that's

00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:48,320
it now it's going to start at 4:22 p.m.

00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,500
every day before I go home for the day

00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,610
and check for any nice one for until

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,400
second

00:44:52,610 --> 00:45:02,150
enjoy on that day and that's it we've

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,700
learned how to use tank UI to write

00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:07,940
flows to deploy floors we've seen how

00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:11,330
easy it is to read the flows and to

00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:13,010
learn from the documentation if you're

00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:16,430
interested in helping out tag UI

00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:18,590
we're always welcoming contributors head
