hi everybody afternoon thanks for coming

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,170
to my talk apology that I couldn't be

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,450
there physically but I'm still glad that

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,780
you choose to spend your time listening

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,630
to my talk so just make sure that you

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,359
are in the right place in this talk I'll

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,810
be covering a few things the first thing

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,060
is to explain asfo who are we and what

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,539
are you trying to do the second thing is

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,239
to share view how we create open source

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,610
solutions using the experience and

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,190
knowledge we have by doing real life in

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,710
- your projects and the third thing of

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,559
course is to share few available

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,710
pre-built solutions now quick overview

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,860
of them so hopefully by end of this talk

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,010
some of you might find some inspirations

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,870
or potential use cases for them and if

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,449
you have any questions regarding our

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,399
open source solutions feel free to let

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,370
us know through our website our forum

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,189
will be mighty happy to share few more

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,790
details about the open source solutions

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,850
that we have built so a bit of myself

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,390
are I'm currently a principal air

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,479
consultant is what I do on a daily basis

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,960
I have companies to embark on AI

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,890
journeys so it could be companies of any

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,590
size sign doesn't have to be SME or

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:32,310
amc's so any corporations that wish to

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,220
begin that AI journeys be it define a

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,560
problem statements are building a simple

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,960
am others to sort of a specific needs

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,490
this is where our coming with my

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,680
colleagues so that's my role at AI

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,140
Singapore at a symptom I'm being

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,299
seconded to the national Iran faces

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,880
Singapore so another national offices

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,979
Singapore I'm handling the healthcare

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,460
portfolio so I'm providing my AI

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,759
technical expertise there if you got to

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,829
some national healthcare projects since

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm also a visiting member I finally

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,129
start up so this is where I provide some

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,900
mentorship so the CEOs of startups so in

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,450
the evening I am pursuing my

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,870
come on stop competing and yes so you

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,420
can see quite a busy person and in the

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,640
past I was one finance so I used to be a

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,060
trainee trader plus a procurement

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,939
manager so nice meeting everybody I so

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,269
be a copyright and let's get started so

00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,819
what is who are we and what are we

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:39,060
trying to do so I'm a mission is to

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:42,450
build deep national capabilities in AI

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,129
and AI by creating social and economic

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,989
impacts grow local talent and build AI

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,720
ecosystem in Singapore so let me worry

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,889
true that the overall statements from

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,489
the left of the right through the

00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:59,639
graphic so are we are funded by n RF

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:03,959
National Research Foundation and we are

00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:07,290
hosted by a new S and a is embossed at

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,260
the intent is sending around June July

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,500
period and what we do is that we have to

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,319
coordinate scarce resources this way now

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,290
a is very hot and had a serious face

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,900
cars so we coordinate across different

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,480
agencies and different universities and

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,019
research institutions so the coordinate

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,659
efforts to do AI development activities

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,010
gather by real-life needs so what we do

00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,290
is I will go out the top of the

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,120
industries and the fire was the needs

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,180
and from there we do some coordination

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,819
activities I have to build am orders for

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,819
them so at the same time I do to the

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,400
scarcity of AI talents we also have our

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,690
own in-house talent development program

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,780
such as the AI apprenticeship program AP

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,299
fo e AI for everybody is a free three

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,419
hours talk online you can join the air

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,370
for is air for industry so we give you

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,799
access to the I came for you to trails

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,220
on the coding exercises and if yes for

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,109
ss4 students and yes for kids right so

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,579
we go all the way down the debating

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:16,079
school ever to train people in using AI

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,870
so and the ESC part we are three

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,740
different pillars or we have the AI

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,500
research technology and AI innovations

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,550
so and the yeah research what we do is

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,990
that we embed

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,849
resources in inventing a next generation

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,699
area techniques and algorithms those so

00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:38,250
this is where the fundamental research

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,740
take place by Reed inside our Paris e

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,569
preserving the eye things a federated

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,060
learning things like that

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:47,759
so on the AI technology so this army is

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,050
soft national challenges so I think that

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,090
right now one of the challenges you

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,009
trying to soft is on health care in

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,259
tackling the tree hitch right

00:04:53,009 --> 00:05:00,060
hypotension hypoglycemia and another

00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:03,090
Hitcher so innovation is where I am from

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,419
so innovation is small industry facing

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,449
so under AR innovations we have three

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:12,270
different teams the first team is Lenny

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,430
I'm so Anna Lenny I you have various

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,479
talent development programs that we have

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,090
to teach people about AI and I go deeper

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,030
into AI AP later on which is our

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:28,169
flagship program and that's also a

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:32,159
program called do AI Anna do AI this

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:35,099
area do AI reef the industry so honey

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:37,469
experiments and a IEP goes hand in hand

00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:40,800
I will elaborate more on them later on

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:43,229
we have the air brakes which is the open

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,169
source solutions that we have developed

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,960
and trying to promote to the industry to

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,560
use because the free and open source we

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,110
have the AI clinic and AI discovery so

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,669
these two are more on the consulting um

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:03,289
so this where we help the companies to

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:06,000
define common statements are on AI light

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,819
of the hundred problems that they have

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,629
which are the other problems that they

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,520
should focus on the software and you

00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,259
have data really necessary also are one

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,930
of the thing that we notice is that in

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,479
other companies that we engage the

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,930
Taurus that they have data but they are

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,879
not really for ml so what we do is that

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,039
we have the in-house program to help

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,210
them do some data readiness check and

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,520
design the radius preparation so that

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,500
once the is done that data can be fed

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,139
into whichever am orders that they want

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,050
to do one and lastly we have the

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,110
I so initially I we have the following

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,330
laws and community which can be our

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,469
ecosystem in Singapore where air

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,259
petitioners can share ideas each other

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:57,150
so let me go in that on to the hundred

00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,810
experiments i yeah i apprenticeship

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,939
which I briefly described earlier

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,909
so under often experiments what we do is

00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,939
that we work with any organization in

00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:11,189
Singapore of any size as soon as they

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,029
have porn statements and they have a

00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:17,430
dataset we can do something together so

00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:20,129
under the hundred experiments we have

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,590
two tracks on the higher as well for

00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,349
research so under the research uses a

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,080
top on the duration certificate it

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:30,479
demands so this video we shall to a

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,939
network to get a professor to join the

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,219
team to do the air modeling together so

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,699
for a project or qualify under air

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:40,139
research we must be something that is

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,060
fundamentally challenging it could be

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,009
there the company needs a brand new

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,279
algorithm the dues are the things that

00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:49,110
it can be done using out-of-the-box

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,150
pencil or Python modules so they have to

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,779
develop a brand new algorithms to solve

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,409
a specific business needs so you saw

00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:01,770
this track called AI for industry 100 a

00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:04,560
4 I so in this project typically that

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,500
division is diamonds a small translation

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,319
nature meaning that let me give you

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,050
example sa ibang come to us and they

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,659
want do a customer churn predictions so

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,669
typically these are problems are could

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:21,389
be solved using out-of-the-box solutions

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,899
right SK learn operations of fraud you

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,810
name it

00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,120
so in this for this compound statements

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,580
this is where we were work together of

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,370
an imine spirit to do the MOS for them

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,680
and he is also under this hundred efore

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,789
I will assign apprentices to the

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,750
projects to work on this together so

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,750
this is where we smashed the man and a

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,480
supply together so under the demon say a

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,540
company could have a demand for a

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,089
specific solutions to address that is

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,519
less news on a surprise

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,860
we do is that we will have this AI

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,379
apprenticeship training program where we

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,629
require people to quit a job

00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:06,180
giant programs of animal spirits so do

00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,790
these diamonds that apprentices you do

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,309
the tree a bit under the project so

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,730
along in that project team there'll be

00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:17,309
like a engineer it could be me or my

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,529
colleagues and the project managers so

00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:21,329
this for the five main team will be

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,790
assigned to this project with the

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:28,019
sponsor project sponsor over the next

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,850
nine months to solve the models about

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,339
the business problems that they are

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,759
trying to address so overview this is

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,999
how the fact ship programs of ours the

00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,639
hermit experiments and AP works so now

00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:43,829
me wondering so what does this has to do

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:48,540
if the open source solutions that we

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:50,699
have right sure our engagement with

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,490
different industry will have on

00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:55,680
different sectors across different use

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,199
cases so that is just go see if you a

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,329
few of the hand of projects I've done

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,569
which is pretty interesting so on the

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:06,929
top left we have done a project with

00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:09,240
subburaj Rome they do a pretty live in

00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:11,009
Dana's right the pretty fish leaf will

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,600
break down in events so they can they

00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:14,999
can send attention style to do some

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,929
predictive maintenance check sign we

00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:21,899
also done a project with our agents our

00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:24,269
company on credit scoring so this is

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,870
typically for ham bank so for example if

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:30,389
I if I may come to you we find in

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,529
banking shriek readily and when I borrow

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:35,040
$50 from you

00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:37,050
how can you access that the person is

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,040
fine we found a proper credit score in

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,420
place so you have done that so dream my

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,339
apprenticeship days I have done a

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,129
project with a kidney dialysis company

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,079
to predict the hospitalization risk of a

00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,879
kidney patient which is the project on

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,279
our top right right so this is one of

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,319
the projects I have done over the night

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,749
my periods so I was from the bench to

00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:01,439
apprenticeship program I graduated and

00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:04,049
thankfully yes Singapore likes me and I

00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:07,830
like them as well so decided join them

00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:11,160
as a engineer subsequently becoming

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,320
happened here we also done a project on

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,750
kana crew management so this with

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,460
chronic care so our what have done is

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,640
that they we have developed this ear

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,170
model to look at the wounds and through

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,240
able to identify whether the woman is

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,620
shooting on not right so typically if

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,420
you have a chronic wound

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,250
what you have to do is that every few

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,850
weeks you have to go to our poly connect

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,850
on any night person is fine they will

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,590
open up the wound the bandages and look

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,720
through the wound and do some poking to

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,570
see where the wound is healing right so

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,120
this is long extensive and painful so we

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,950
have developed a model it's running on a

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,800
mobile phone they can look at the wounds

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,920
itself to assess whether the patient is

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,960
to go for for the checkup or not we have

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,210
also our own any appeal code-switching

00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,510
on the right hand side which is the

00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,760
spiritual texts which I would do a quick

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,910
demo little you son

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,730
Adnan meditation with a Security Agency

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,310
so based on the movement of the vessel

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,830
on radar can detect that this is no more

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,630
and more traffic and I have the tunnel

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,360
project if I'm a factual Astra you

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,790
actually manufacture do look you think

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,470
motivations look at the equipment's to

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,390
see how lightly that a custom is right

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,090
we've done these things that is been

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:30,570
producer and lastly we are done a

00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,910
project with Expedia so Expedia has done

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,820
up gave us on named entity vaccinations

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:38,940
fine because they are the way the people

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,490
search in the text in Japan way that

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,530
many different scripts of your pain

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,360
scripts so they are could refer to the

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,510
same thing so how do you improve the

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,280
search results of the customer so on

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,380
some of our projects that I mentioned

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,670
earlier are announced in the new site

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,190
that so I can share their names

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,560
but for most of the project I've done we

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,720
are saying in de non-disclosure

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,190
agreements the companies so for some of

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,900
the projects I can share the company's

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,630
names right if you do a quick search on

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,460
Google you'll see that a lot of our

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,770
projects they have done with big

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,140
companies right it's all on a new site

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,380
you can see the Expedia is here

00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:20,760
subversion over here kiona this is on

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,950
the on south herpes and on 50p to do

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,360
some

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,770
construction safety using yeah so now I

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,790
come to the main part of the day

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:36,330
presentation right yes in about bricks

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:40,260
how how do I link the higher experiments

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:43,130
that etapa do the air simple breeze so

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,450
let me explain using this raffia so

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:49,590
guessing what is in a very unique

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:53,310
position because we we are we will

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:56,360
across different industry of companies

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:59,390
of different sizes so we have a lot of

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,060
Englishmen with the industry and

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,820
sometimes if a project doesn't fit into

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,980
the hammer experiments because in our

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,170
experiments guessing about what

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,600
co-founder project together with the

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:16,470
company so for projects and the hundred

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,450
experiments is go through two stages of

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,600
approval internally before they get the

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,660
fundings from a Singapore to compute the

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,000
model together so for some other

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,580
projects I which are small simple in

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,800
Asia we will take them on under our

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,840
consulting arms and we are doing so

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,840
usually for discount projects or

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,420
consulting projects is usually three to

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,820
four months period so we work with pre

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,450
projects if you must on another honey

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,850
for research Naima's long funnel if for

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,370
industry and shorten project under

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,480
consulting so we have projects really

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:57,150
for super complex to quite manageable

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,700
easy to do and at the same time to our

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,690
this project Englishman we have we spoke

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:06,630
with the management of the company sine

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,760
beta cos the machinery does on what the

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,620
problems are facing so what we then do

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,560
is that from all the learnings and

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,410
experience that we have we take the

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,380
common denominator of them are not a

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,920
data not the proprietary algorithm but

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:26,040
on our knowledge and experience we put

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:31,620
them up together and we develop into a

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:33,370
bricks that can solve most use cases in

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,820
the industry

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,220
so let me give you example so the first

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,460
bricks are open-source solutions so let

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,410
me clarify by bricks we mean open-source

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,480
solutions way so bricks is just our

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,800
acronyms way

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,720
so the first brick that we have

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,300
developed is for robotic process

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,960
automation automating your keyboard and

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,210
mouse to spare ability so one of the

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,450
bricks that we have is that UI so that

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,670
you guys open-source are up here too you

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,470
can see on right hand side is a

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,920
demonstration of how you can download

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:12,430
the files wrecks the effects rates from

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,850
BBS and send it to email to whoever you

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:18,790
need the way so this is one of our open

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,800
source software I can take a look at our

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,710
site which I will show you later on if

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,250
you wish to use this internally in-house

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,350
I won't be pull us out of it please go

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,210
ahead

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:34,180
the next interesting books that we have

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:38,110
is called golden retriever we will name

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,740
our we need are our NLP to nation and

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:44,790
processing crews and dogs so one of the

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,210
economy fever so this is like FAQ FAQ

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,060
with River

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:53,680
so under this what we do is they write

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:57,880
in a typical in a typical chat bot you

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,970
need to prepare data by listing the

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,490
questions and answer yourself so the

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:07,660
unique use case of our golden retriever

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:10,689
is that you don't need to specify which

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,520
answer attack to which question if you

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:15,790
have a document of FAQ

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,270
by loading it into the coding Shiva it

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:22,030
can ultimately pass out the semantic

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,819
meaning of each paragraph so whenever

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,730
your type questions into the coding

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:30,780
receiver you can if you like the top

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,520
three most relevant paragraph in that

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,710
documents then loaded inside so the use

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,950
case is say for example you are working

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,320
as a sales man you your company has a

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,090
lot policies for you to follow so when

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,670
our customers are so hey can I have a

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,710
came at the destination and he said okay

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,230
let me check

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,350
you can type your questions right into

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,330
the into our engine and they'll give you

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,610
that very vain paragraph in the policy

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,280
the good about this is that I start

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,920
dependent on my control finally the

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,880
aides that he was match it's dependent

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,690
on semantic meaning so I say for example

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,310
life and love even though they are not

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,380
exactly the same by somatically that are

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,020
same so the engine will be able to

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:21,480
recognize this you can try out the demo

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:24,750
on MSI next we have this another dock

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,600
it's called cocky so it's Auto Libre so

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,970
the use case is that it helps to

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,790
accelerate your data labeling process

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,610
right this issue is that you might have

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,190
I see you are in a call center or you

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,900
are running a ecommerce store consumer

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:47,990
reviews I issue is for you to train

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:51,030
customer cementation assessment customer

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:54,000
sentiment analysis model you need to

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:58,320
mainly take the issue of the paragraph I

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,620
so by using these tools right uses are

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,390
non- factorization behind it you can

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,270
read up more on our site but why it does

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:11,820
say he helps us peel up the way you take

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:14,120
your data and one more thing about NRP

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,520
is there any piece very complex

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,210
especially in Singapore context why is

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,400
that so

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,370
nice ticularly centers right they woman

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,160
pata always makin a copy that one so in

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,020
this way short sentences you have it you

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,670
have various languages come a together

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,130
your camera when during Cantonese

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,460
English okay Emily and as English have

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:39,450
one by the back if you are to say that

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:42,360
this sentence into Google Translate he

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,950
will give you the transition is that

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,340
won't be that good the transcription

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,520
because Google requires you to speak in

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,860
that language then select and in comfort

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,170
English right but for most Singaporeans

00:19:52,860 --> 00:20:00,240
like me will class speak proper English

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:03,210
so we need our own speech to text

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,120
engine that can handle ours in English

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:12,590
so this is where we have we have this

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:16,280
like our we have this and our peoples

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:21,390
here so you have these end up here tools

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:24,690
that can handle different languages sp3

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,760
so this is our own speech lab alright so

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,950
let me give you a quick demo sessions

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,830
because this is a red color I'm not so

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:36,080
sure carry but this other dimension is

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,080
available on our site so nice here

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,050
you

00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:00,300
now hope the audio is silvered available

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,940
to you so essentially what the guy is

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,260
saying is that it's a hello what about

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,360
saying means that I wanna make police

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,090
department Chinese right so this guy is

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,460
testing the engine by using both English

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,050
and Chinese at the same time and our

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,150
engine is able to transcribe the

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,100
languages in real-time for two languages

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,500
right so this is something that Google

00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,470
Translate is not able to do but we have

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,080
a demo for our speech read on the

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:30,780
website feel peaceful fiddle give it a

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:33,810
try so what is next right so uh a

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:38,460
Singapore we have this recap again we

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:41,880
have the lenny i shy and do aii right so

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,650
we can go to a website let me just give

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,430
you a quick demo shisha now on a website

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:50,580
so on a website here you can go to a a

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:53,190
singapore makerspace this website and

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:56,160
and then do a i this is where all our

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:58,020
bricks are so for example right let me

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,030
give you an example so this is an

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,130
example on golden retriever which I

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,930
mentioned earlier so what we have done

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,060
is that we have loaded in the Covenant

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,760
in the WSFL right so this is interesting

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,500
so right now if it's a boyfriend you can

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,890
tell me what is going up I recite we

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,380
could fetch so these are other databases

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,360
are FAQ they load up on the Minister of

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,600
Health is Singapore so if you the top

00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:25,800
Trevizo so you can see Conover / family

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,770
of viruses you know yeah so this is the

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,370
what I mean by giving you the top three

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:40,640
answers that you have so let me give a

00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:43,230
try here so is coronavirus dangerous

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:50,000
okay let me I think if I try to see what

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:50,000
it works alone okay so so the answer is

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,880
okay so if you see one of the top two

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,400
answer is mainstream statistics of the

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,340
virus is unclear in my time I've had

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,490
people severe disease definitely percent

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,920
so the engine is able to Buffy

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,530
understand the somatic meaning behind

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:15,000
injuries and give you better answer than

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:17,910
me so I have come to the end of my

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,300
presentation so let me recap for you

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:23,820

I can accelerate a I journey and what we

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,410
are doing right now is that through this

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,970
AI bricks or open source solutions we

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,680
are taking our industrial experience

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,920
industry experience combined with the

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:48,210

00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:51,150
our learnings and knowledge from doing

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,300
this project and turn them into find a

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,190
common denominator and turn them into

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,220
open source solutions which anybody can

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:02,880
use if I interested in using our energy

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:06,780
