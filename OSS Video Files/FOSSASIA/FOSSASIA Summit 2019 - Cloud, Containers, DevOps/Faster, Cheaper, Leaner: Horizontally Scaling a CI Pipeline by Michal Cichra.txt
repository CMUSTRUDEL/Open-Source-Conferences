If your Continuous Integration pipeline is slow, you are basically wasting money! A CI pipeline is an essential tool for any modern development team, as the necessary quality assurance mechanism that ensures they can deliver working software. Slow, (or, worse, broken) pipelines cause serious impediment to development teams, and this impediment directly translates into wasted $$$. 

Instead, CI should be very much treated like any other production system the company maintains. Whereas the customer-facing systems bring revenue into the company, the CI pipeline ensures the development teams remain productive and efficient in serving the former. 

From this talk, you can expect to pick up some tips on how to speed up your CI pipelines -  leveraging cloud capabilities, such as horizontal scaling of its workloads to cater for more / heavier /longer builds. This leads to short feedback loops in the development cycle, and - therefore - a more efficient use of your dev teamâ€™s (expensive) time.  And for the cherry on top,  you will probably be reducing your CI costs while doing all this!
