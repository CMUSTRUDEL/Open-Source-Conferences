No doubt Open Sources technologies are leading the IT business. Every day we hear about Open Source implementations successes but also fails. For what reasons? Mostly because companies were unable to build a sustainable Operation Model including 24/7 support, upgrading strategy and so on. The reality is: not everyone can be an Open Source Technical Leader and Operation Manager have to deal with people with different skillset from different places and cultures. In this topic, I will share my experience building Operation Support teams in large international companies. How we filled the gap between high-level expertise needs, real-life people and a... tight budget of course! We will see why OS Model is so valuable by leveraging partners and communities inside and outside the company.
