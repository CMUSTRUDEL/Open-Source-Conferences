No doubt Open Sources technologies are leading the IT business. Every day we hear about Open Source implementations successes but also fails. For what reasons? Mostly because companies were unable to build a sustainable Operation Model including 24/7 support, upgrading strategy and so on. The reality is: not everyone can be an Open Source Technical Leader and Operation Manager have to deal with people with different skillset from different places and cultures. In this topic, I will share my experience building Operation Support teams in large international companies. How we filled the gap between high-level expertise needs, real-life people and a... tight budget of course! We will see why OS Model is so valuable by leveraging partners and communities inside and outside the company.

Capgemini I'm in charge of I'm working

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,070

perfectly of herbs help or abuse but

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,899
also Tallis and some over company you

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,179
have here where to work on open global

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,550
technical strategy but portugee open

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,860
source in captain just to let you know

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,660
in in my life I was

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,840
director of develops for the Canadian

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,390
division and after I run the global

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,510
kubernetes platform worldwide for all

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:30,500
the company and and what's what's it

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:34,910
about me what yesterday I heard a lot

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,620
open-source warned personally I never

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,480
walk in open-source because I would like

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,000
to warn is like martial heart you know I

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,740
never start much I purchased martial

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,540
heart for 25 years not because I would

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,010
like to to win someone it's because I

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,080
would like to be a bit on myself and

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,330
that's why I'm doing open source tree

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,940
and that's why I'm doing open source for

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,130
four years and and what's really

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,010
important because ok we won't

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,530
that's it but we have a huge challenge

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,810
in front of us because we we talking

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,940
about project in a big company we have

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,580
different legacy to manage first we have

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,410
the technical legacy you won you win

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,790
today but anyway you have to deal with

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:18,360
30 years proprietary solution deploy in

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,340
company you have to deal with stuff in

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,110
production today you have to manage them

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,530
you have maybe you have to work with

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,390
them for at least the next 10 years and

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,580
this is really important when you're

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,950
talking about big company thinking not

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,050
like I'm startup I just thought today

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm going to grab some kubernetes no you

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,980
have to manage the real fact you have

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,959
WebSphere you have RS for is for 500 you

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,720
have a lot of technology and you gonna

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,500
have voice technology for years also you

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,030
have a human legacy you know I've been

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,090
used to work with with Linux guy I'm a

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,550
linear guy and today my team is not a

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,030
linear guide today my team it's Windows

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,670
guys is VMware guys and what people used

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,430
to work in a pro Paris world used to

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,400
work with projects already built we used

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,590
to walk on in a way very different also

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,600
you have lot of people from hardware and

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,850
you know when you're talking about micro

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,470
services to someone I used to work on

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,630
the hardware side it's it's a big

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,010
challenge and this is really important

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,229
when you you would like to deal with

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,090
particular big company you have to think

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,180
ok about everything you say

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,730
it it's good and if you know it's good

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,620
but now how you apply that with people

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,800
they are not maybe sometime ready to do

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,380
and to practice in the real life first

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,630
it's about management you have lot of

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,910
water for mindsets in a big company

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,470
Portugal waterfall is not only the way

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,050
you manage software production or

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,960
software lifecycle it's also a way you

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,380
managing problem and for example in the

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,630
B company project managers they are the

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,139
master of the class you know they decide

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,169
everything and this is really important

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,729
to understand you have the year or key

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,850
between technical people and

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,070
non-technical people is really on the

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,570
advantage of non-technical people in big

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,700
company and because for many reasons

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,789
historical reason also you have you very

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,860
very sharp or cost-saving strategy for

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,650
example when you walk with abuse abuse

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,389
it's a big big big company women age

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,970
planes all around the world and they

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,190
manage their provider as we manage any

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,600
other provider you know and when we're

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,370
talking about software when we're

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,460
talking about our TV would like to save

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,039
coast we would like to save money also

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,950
it's a procurement process the way you

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,060
acquire software your cry services they

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:50,760
are honor they are really we build it on

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,789
the on the old fashion made we build it

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,220
about subscription label it about how

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,789
I'm going to pay for Microsoft and so on

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,220
that's why I like this about sentence

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,349
it's really about okay you have to

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,539
convince yourself is like you mantra I

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,880
would like to do open-source on tortoise

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:12,599
is good for me I have to do that but how

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,150
and I'm going to be ready people are

00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,490
scared today really in big company I

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,680
think I scare for where job I scare for

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,490
their futures and this is really

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,960
important to to help them and to figure

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:31,500
out and to find a way to to resolve

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,440
first we have the good news force our

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,780
motto today when we talking about both

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,630
technology both different stacks they

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,090
are not

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,670
rocket science at least all of them are

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,820
here for five years even kubernetes is

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:50,160
one of the of the last and spinnaker

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,850
maybe is the last one but for example

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,890
when I'm talking to my this is my my

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,320
stack I'm talk with my client you know I

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,380
manage when I was in Manulife pivotal

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,510
cloud foundry in production today I'm

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,970
running a kubernetes and docker

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,370
previously with pivotal kubernetes now

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,680
we've opened chiefed we have an avid

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,260
vania version on each scenario we use

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,120
today a github artifact origin Cannes

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,790
you know it's really important to

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,930
understand the starker here maybe

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,640
sometimes we are the big

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,260
misunderstanding about what his

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,510
continuous delivery and what is

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,730
continuous integration there are a lot

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,880
of people misunderstand about that and

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,430
and today we managing my team is

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,520
managing the infrastructure part just

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,460
look at this picture if you look at only

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,570
one or two years ago an infrastructure

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,440
team managed only private and public

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,990
infrastructure service you could say

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,780
private or public infrastructure today

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,780
we have to manage all of them you know

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,910
last yesterday you will have to manage

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,320
the VM today you have to manage a

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,270
continuous delivery platform a

00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,210
continuous platform and you have to

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,760
manage and to offer to your client all

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,800
solution to deploy CCI that's a world

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,440
change of the world it's everything it's

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,890
changing and you have to manage Viton to

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,590
- to build your skill set on it and but

00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:16,980
we have another good news in this world

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,110
communities are strong and really really

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,300
strong just look at today what we have

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,020
revenue event like force Allianz we

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,130
could sell

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,440
grant event after what you have grounded

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,650
chief foundation you have OpenStack

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,599
Foundation I think OpenStack really I've

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,090
been working for long with OpenStack

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,370
OpenStack really open after the Linux

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,770
Foundation really opened the new way of

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,540
managing foundation today you have crown

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,700
a chief Aneesh and OpenStack transition

00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,980
is soon open infrastructure foundation

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,600
you have the Linux Foundation just look

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,240
at the Linux on the exchanges size of

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
the foundation today you know you you

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,980
going

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,560
everywhere you have Linux Foundation

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,019
somewhere Apache is the same thing

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,470
Apache as sometime you you say just stop

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,850
to accept project you are too big you

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,190
are more project about people you know

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,500
it's it's a problem but that bad patch

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,380
is stronger so and more than what Apache

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,779
it is the way you managing you you

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,430
listens and it's a way you managing the

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,459
collaboration it's but really what

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,290
Apache bring on the table you also have

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,360
Eclipse for everything it's about Java

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,370
but you know for I don't know if you

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,850
know but for the first time you have the

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,399
Jakarta just replace the java to java a

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,380
he and for the first time eclipse really

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,740
manage the new version of the Java

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,880
Runtime and this is really interesting I

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:43,470
have a friend of mine everywhere now and

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:46,769
I really didn't expect that only a few

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,630
years ago we are we we do have a

00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:54,480
foundation we have a foundation so

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:57,029
strong and first third sorry we have the

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,720
business is mature to just look at the

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,959
market today

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,060
okay reddit IBM okay don't care about

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,230
the acquisition but let's look at reddit

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,600
look at our she cop we really good

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,209
project really a good way to attack the

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,040
market they are mature on not only on

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,740
the technical side they are mature on

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,380
the way they go on the market on the way

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,709
they manage a partnership with over

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,649
vendors with with a company like us G

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:28,560
froggen it lab they arrest I think all

00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:30,870
of them around the 15 million dollars 60

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,259
million each of them the last last year

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:39,870
to grow the company Gita was acquired by

00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:43,319
Microsoft reddit was a cry by by by by

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,689
IBM and our she crop I think a lot of

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:48,300
new a lot of you know terraform for

00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:51,230
example on over to side but it's it's a

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,120
huge and vast company are well and

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,550
what's why big over the the legacy

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,160
people like VMware like IBM and so on

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,319
try to attract them and just to be sure

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,560
okay

00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:05,720
but now

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,910
if you would like to think about big

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,399
company if you like to manage a big

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,560
company is not about Excel documentation

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,130
is not about process you have to think

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,440
24/7 everything you're doing today is -

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,649
you have one objective I'm going to run

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,029
that platform 24/7 I don't want no one

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,560
wake up on Saturday morning at 4 a.m. to

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:31,459
fix my platform in production never

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,490
never no one touch the platform during

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:37,130
the weekend at night and so on this is

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,420
really we not Netflix we not Twitter we

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,639
not a company like that when we're

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,190
talking about big company the company we

00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,029
have another job like herpes and they

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,820
have to manage platform is really is

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,610
really is really important when you

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,649
thinking develops you know it's this

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,839
loop is really cool you could put any

00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:00,980
many technology on it but for me

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,660
develops his production it's security to

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,370
go in production each time I have the

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,560
same question how you manage the

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,560
difference we've known pretend prod how

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,339
you use and you identify yourself when

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:18,649
you're going in prod which is the master

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:21,860
we which is which is the team which team

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:25,819
has the key of the DevOps tooling this

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:31,279
is really really really important I have

00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:35,470
a coat of oh okay I just stop I think I

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,470
see something strange okay now

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,250
I would like to share with you a cut of

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,630
the day you say okay it's world we in

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,110
the window greener we're going to talk

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,019
about love today with Guillaume you saw

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,440
it's a French writer okay you could take

00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:56,410
just one minute to to read this one it's

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,410
about love and it's really beautiful you

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,019
know and I like this one love is like

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,790
fire on a rainy day you've got to spend

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,700
all you all your time for taking it

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:11,769
fitting it telling it because if you

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:16,750
don't it if you don't it goes out okay

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:22,480
you see okay but what is the link with

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:27,670
today just replace love by POC proof of

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:31,000
concept it's exactly what is it blog

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,890
book is like love is wonderful okay

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,339
everything it's about talk you have

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,470
everything but in the real life know

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,709
what lasts in the pain had come after

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,920
book just look at you have to fit your

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:48,130
book you have to to take to take care of

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,060
it and you you know after you book is

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,339
going to be a nightmare

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,770
you know everything it's okay the client

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:57,160
is happy you have a park everything it's

00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,810
okay is the best people just say okay we

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,020
deliver the park we could go in another

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,630
project no no you you don't get it you

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,760
have to stay and we're going to run it

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,120
together if you're not ready to run with

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,940
me at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday morning this

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,649
is not a project this you just playing a

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,450
game with your computer and it's cool

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:22,440
but if you like to go further you really

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,329
in tune it to to to thinking about that

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,730
with in 15 years

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,390
I saw many projects fail Portugal in

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,800
open source

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:34,540
I think OpenStack is the good example

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,440
because I saw many many OpenStack

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,339
project failed

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,399
but why first let's do it myself from

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,529
scratch everything is the same you have

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,149
a guys is clever it's smart it's the

00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:48,220
best guy you have you would like to do

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,620
from scratch you know if you like to do

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,950
it you take the crowd to go upstream and

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,840
what's it you deploy it

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,210
he's on she buys away as there's only

00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,980
guys in the world could you or we build

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,380
what he's done you know no reverse

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,290
engineering here only one engineer do

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,150
does VAT you know or did that first

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,970
secondly oh it's open source let's do

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,470
chip okay within a safe money

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,570
we're going to go directly we're going

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,050
to go build a POC and we're gonna do

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,570
that really lean lean management meaning

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,870
okay I'm gonna give you less money than

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:26,010
I give to Microsoft before that's my

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:28,110
plan and after that okay guys we have

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,060
the pork we don't have any more any

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,720
skill set about how managing the POC

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:37,440
let's move this back in production okay

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,350
you have a pork with no money only one

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,920
guys lead it and you're going to go in

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:47,700
production after that when you you it's

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,890
it's real life example I have it's in

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,350
any big company it's always when you

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,330
talk about people yeah but about how you

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,670
gonna manage it in run or how you gonna

00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,670
move even on the bill to move to the pro

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,830
to POC to prod people say are people

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,020
will learn by themselves if we're gonna

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,730
go oh Kuban a test you can kubernetes

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,980
dot io it's okay if you have all the

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,810
documentation let's take the guys you

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,390
say you have three weeks to to train

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,220
them and you go online and that's it and

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,850
you're going to have expert after three

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,130
weeks of learning online you know and or

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,830
you say okay let's go certify them

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,560
online it's gonna is going to be okay

00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,320
another things I saw and I so really

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,320
it's no documentation and I don't know

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,430
how many of you really document what

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,980
with what we do every day you know

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,420
really it's it's about and partically

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,940
when you are in the pocket you're

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,280
running on time you have a constraint

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,260
and sometimes they are consultant come

00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,660
only for the park and we are besties

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,110
only one week and you have to deal that

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:55,410
and most of them then we've really

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,900
forgot the N one support the guys is

00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:02,850
going to is going to talk to Cole at the

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:05,709
first line but exactly what is 24/7 it's

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,990
you have a guy in like three

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,779
gingka during the weekend he liked doing

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:15,610
any many things in his in his oral life

00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:20,529
and his job is on only his job okay that

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:22,209
is the one every we can ramp up if they

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,890
have any issue and you have to manage

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:27,039
your documentation you have to manage

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,559

this matter could go anywhere can do

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,370
anything that's the big difference you

00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:38,500
have in open source community compared

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,620
to a big company in open source to

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,110
treaty you have all the people as much

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,240
you know we are smart or look at my demo

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,149
look at myself okay but in the big

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,190
company we can pay only smart people you

00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:53,529
know and or many of you like

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,580
documentation how many of you are okay

00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:59,380
to do 24/7 front office support okay

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,679
after you finish you talk how many of

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,840
you are already to say okay with my job

00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,779
I'm gonna get this in production and I'm

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,909
sure because I'm good guys I do I I did

00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:12,730
my job well you know most of them we

00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:14,799
just finish that was exciting and we're

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:18,760
gonna go in the new technology new are

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:22,090
we are let's do let's do er IR a let's

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:26,380
do a another thing that's why to finish

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:29,190
on this first you build a back not a

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,990
stack we really don't care about

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:34,090
technology because this is not open

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,640
source is not about technology it's

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,370
about the capabilities to change and to

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,480
improve your technology you build a back

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,070
a rhythmic back and and why because what

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,240
you would like to do is to have a team

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:53,649
ready ready to to to attack ready to to

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,360
manager project first I never go in in

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:59,200
the company in big company without an

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,640
editor read ads it could be pivotal it

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,399
could be any Jeff rock it could be first

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,559
build work with an editor a ball a be

00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:09,789
sure you have a good subscription and

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,669
you're going to be supported by the

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,399
editor is not your job to upgrade Linux

00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:17,139
is not your job to upgrade artifact

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:19,660
Orion to be sure you don't have backdoor

00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:22,930
I just have a question before about

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,510
we manage docker security no is going to

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,000
be managed by itself no Dockery no

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,220
doctor is not managing security at home

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,910
it's your process is ruling your heart

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:37,530
today if this is this is one of the big

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:40,060
witness of docker it's you you have

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,470
trouble to manage it in production but

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,470
if you're working with for example

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,390
OpenShift we've reddit or we've built

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,600
parkour sauce to image you could have

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:53,470
support from reddit to to arginine you

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,110
you docker images you never grow a

00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:00,160
please on docker hub and put it in

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:04,030
tradition never okay docker hub it's

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,710
only to to play with your laptop you

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,810
have contribution back I have five

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,450
million contribution back is is really

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:13,120
hard for big company not only about the

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,470
legal and process it's all else also

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,860
because most of the time you just

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:20,020
integrates you just have a configuration

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,670
in your walk on the technology you're

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,350
not going to contribute you have people

00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,050
for example we could contribute because

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,150
there were activities or Twitter or

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,520
Facebook but when you are Arab use it's

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,850
really hard because you main goal is to

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,920
build plane is not to build software if

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,650
you go on difference in space one of the

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,390
area of herbals we are in the deter and

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,550
the manage software we could or

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,500
contribute were most of the big part of

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,500
herpes for example when they're not

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,440
going to contribute would you understand

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,670
about my pocket to production really

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,410
important train new people don't think

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,560
they gonna learn by themselves it's for

00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,890
its force the reality is you have to put

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,020
them in a real training session like

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,730
have long Institute for example you

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,860
could go with if you go with an editor

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,110
is that really help you you're going to

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,320
have a official training from an editor

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,150
also put expert on the table expert

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,530
legal help and we're going to accelerate

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:24,040
the process documentation obviously and

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:26,980
thinking only about 24/7 if you have

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,550
24/7 support in your mind you're going

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,470
to see it's going to be really easy and

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:36,820
finish with this slide

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,070
and you have also to help yourself and

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,840
your team one of the big part I'm

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,600
talking particular about infrastructure

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,280
the big part of divorce when I was

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,500
director of divorce even today we not

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,830
when I help my client in stew on board

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:54,280
people and to on board project but you

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:57,820
know I I remember first my own coal

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,590
activity was in infrastructure style now

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,750
I have to own board people on the

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,890
divorce pipe and I created I think after

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,170
that we're going to have a talk about

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,420
DevOps pipeline you create that you

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,060
devote Brighton is great now you have to

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,700
order them you have to have someone give

00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,320
some advices technical assessment just

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,540
to say okay you have to do that I'm

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,490
going to create you get lab you going to

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,990
create your Jenkins and after everything

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,970
is going to run and I'm going to

00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,150
document that and and after I'm gonna

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,040
support you command is really important

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,590
because you understand about with a pack

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,510
you man

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,700
advises come first you have technology

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,430
beyond technologies and that person

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,520
automated but you need advices you need

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,040
a front line of people not rocket

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,020
science people just take care about your

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:50,110
clients and take care about the project

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:52,600
I would like to share this picture

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,930
because as I said I'm a big fan

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,800
and I was looking because last last year

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:02,020
I was in Seattle in on his grave and I

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:09,720
take this picture I just realized this

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:13,930
day he died before I was born and die

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,640
younger than me now but anyway is

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:19,620
influenced it's a big party clean

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,620
martial heart thank you

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,179
okay we have plenty of time for

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,160
questions

00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,710
and with luck the bouncy Michael turn

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:38,160
itself on time

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:38,429
no bad see Mike hang on go to work this

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:50,940
time

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:53,040
all right deliberate okay so I I work in

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:57,860
a similar field I also try to help

00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:01,980
companies see see the light with DevOps

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:04,020
but the way I've been in two types of

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,500
projects right one is where DevOps is

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,750
comes in as a mega project right with a

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,250
team of consultants and everything gets

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:16,950
to gets transformed training everything

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:19,590
full package and leave and another type

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,950
of project where DevOps is is done

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,080
gradually in a step-by-step we're

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,419
dealing with specific problems that they

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,610
face immediately and and showing them a

00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,340
tool that solves our immediate problem

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,630
and let them see that that this works

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:39,809
and builds up confidence and then go on

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,520
to the next phase but they the problem

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,410
they were the second with this way of

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,860
doing it is that it becomes very very

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:49,440
organic right they're not using for most

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,840
part best practices it works but it may

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,380
be but it's not big best practices the

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,210
first one best practices but then is

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,740
often not sustainable

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:03,780
so I'm wondering where if you approached

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:09,030
in these two ways and how you found the

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:11,610
balance it's it's really what I I think

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,429
my feeling is and how we do it just to

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,620
explain when I was in my life I have I

00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,540
had touching one team was a platform

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,400
team they were working really on the

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,330
engineering that we were internal team

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,340
and I only had seven people were very

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,309
much they were my smart guys you know

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,410
and and on this side I build platform

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:34,480
kubernetes but also pipeline and

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,760
the big part of my company my my team

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,880
after that 30 people were only delivery

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,240
people and their focus is really apply

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,430
and try to apply the best practice and

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,440
welcomes the project to see onboarding

00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:51,190
them and try to apply and to work with

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,020
them but is really is really easy when

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,700
you're talking about containers when

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,560
you're talking about micro services for

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,930
example in my previous company we walk

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,600
it on a non pivotal Cloud Foundry for

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:04,360
everything net anew and on kubernetes to

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,940
move the legacy on someone containerize

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,610
a legacy but I say one is when is net

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,920
new is more a cultural change a new way

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,410
of working perfectly for the developers

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,200
when it's legacy it's sometime it's

00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,780
about technical issue also what's why is

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,550
the only solution I had it develops

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,680
pipeline first standardize the way

00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,860
you're implementing and you connect the

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,650
tools together and after welcome just on

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,760
border project and you don't have one

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:36,550
in fact one recipe you have recipes and

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:41,920
and and you try to to help them to

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:45,250
converge on the same on the same way to

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:51,820
to work DevOps but I had an example

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:56,020
about AIX technology created in the 90s

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:59,350
and we deploy it with with DevOps

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:02,740
tooling get lab Jenkins and Archie

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:07,120
factory but we deploy deployed it it's

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,640
really on the simplest way you could is

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,680
not we the idea is we don't we don't

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,230
want to challenge people we don't want

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,210
to automate but when you go on the net

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,920
new like micro-services know you have to

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:22,000
as you say you have to go fast and you

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,670
have to move and to give them quickly a

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,170
good solution by the way guys from

00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:31,360
legacy they used to wait you know yeah

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,460
when you work with starter we would like

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,180
to go fast but people from legacy they

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,920
used to wait and they know what the prod

00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,070
if you talking about a six-month project

00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,730
they're not going to be scared if you

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,370
say that you

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:51,380
to a small company they're going to be

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:53,950
scared but all right so many thanks

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,590
round of applause please

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,590
