Targeted audience are managers, system architects, system administrators and developers of Linux systems in small to enterprise sized environments. Networked Linux machines more and more take over tasks formerly executed by Mainframe systems. With those tasks also comes the workload which has to be managed and automated. New technologies like Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing and Big Data also require the execution of numerous programs interconnected by dependencies and synchronization needs. To manage those workloads, the use of Enterprise Job Scheduling or Workload Automation systems is self-evident in Mainframe environments for decades. In Linux environments this software class is not widely spread and automation is done using cron, built in scheduling functionality of systems like ETL tools and a bunch of scripts. This creates a numerous amount of problems regarding transparency, maintainability, stability and efficiency. One reason for this development was the lack of an Open Source Workload Automation System able to satisfy the demands. Since 2013 the schedulix Open Source Enterprise Job Scheduling System closes this gap and gives an extremely powerful and reliable tool into the hands of Linux system administrators and software developers. The other reason is the lack of knowledge on this software class and which huge benefits job scheduling systems can deliver. This talk is aimed to change this and to give the audience an introduction to what schedulix can do to establish an efficient, reliable and cost effective IT Workload Automation.
