Fedora Silverblue is an immutable desktop operating system. Aiming at good support for container-focused workflows, this variant of Fedora Workstation targets developer communities.Fedora Silverblue unleashes the power of rpm-ostree to reap you the benefits over traditional distros. The use of rpm-ostree for the coreOS brings fully atomic upgrades, easy rollbacks and workflows that are familiar from OSTree-based servers. An OS image that is composed on the server side allows for testing the exact bits before they reach client systems, leading to more reliable updates.Moving desktop applications into Flatpak brings stronger isolation and solves longstanding issues with using yum/dnf for desktop applications, such as the fact that upgrading deletes the files underneath the running application and often breaks it.Through this talk, I'll demo on how I've been using Fedora Silverblue as my primary workstation, and you could too!
