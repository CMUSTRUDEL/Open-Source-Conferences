	17 March 2019 13:30, Training Room 2-2

Fedora Silverblue is an immutable desktop operating system. Aiming at good support for container-focused workflows, this variant of Fedora Workstation targets developer communities.Fedora Silverblue unleashes the power of rpm-ostree to reap you the benefits over traditional distros. The use of rpm-ostree for the coreOS brings fully atomic upgrades, easy rollbacks and workflows that are familiar from OSTree-based servers. An OS image that is composed on the server side allows for testing the exact bits before they reach client systems, leading to more reliable updates.Moving desktop applications into Flatpak brings stronger isolation and solves longstanding issues with using yum/dnf for desktop applications, such as the fact that upgrading deletes the files underneath the running application and often breaks it.Through this talk, I'll demo on how I've been using Fedora Silverblue as my primary workstation, and you could too!

this dog please welcome sanctuary

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:18,320
excited yeah I hope so

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:29,310
am i audible like so yeah so so one of

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,349
the primary thing that I were talking

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,950
about in this after today afternoon is

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,469
how I migrated to my primary migrated my

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,750
primary work station to completely come

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,379
into container base development work

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,570
station and the primary thing that I

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:52,949
would be targeting is the silver boot

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:56,789
project that was recently released so I

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,379
am really excited right because so let

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,020
me tell you a story on how I actually

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,080
migrated to silver blue so I have been

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,299
working on web-based development for

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,020
around like five six years now and most

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,970
of my development was around vagrant

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,590
boxes so for every book that I did it

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,960
was usually I used to write vagrant

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,390
boxes because I wanted to segregate all

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,850
my environments for each one each and

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,700
every project and over time my laughter

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,470
was slowly becoming too overloaded with

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,960
all those vagrant boxes in place and

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,400
because federal if you know has a lot of

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,509
project in in the infrastructure so to

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,360
context switch into a different project

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,340
it used to become a lot heavier on the

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,490
laptop side so I was looking for

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:46,500
something really innovative in that case

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,780
so and at that point of time I also

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,970
started to look into the containers

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,729
world and I also started working with

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,680
the federal 4os team so this gave me a

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,920
chance to look into the container world

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
and around the same time there was a

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,380
stock by JC prices way on how she has

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,009
this complete workstation on how she

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,110
runs every applications on as a docker

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,200
container right and when she container

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,860
so she gave a talk on couple of

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,470
conferences about this

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,330
so this gave me a motivation on to look

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,270
into this container base development

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,310
workflow so I was looking into my

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:28,350
options and then when I I was hit with

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,630
silver blue so I am really excited to

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,030
give this talk because I want to share

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,130
on what all things I learned over this

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,850
last couple of months of migrating to

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,830
silver blue and I'll share a couple of

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,680
so my talk would go from like how silver

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,530
blue works behind the scenes and how is

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,200
my work development looks like from on a

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,440
day-to-day life and finally I would also

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,240
like to end this talk a bit like a five

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,670
minutes before because I wanted to have

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,430
a discussion around the topic so that we

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,140
get more feedback because silver blue is

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,940
kindly in a development stage so a lot

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,650
of feature would be coming in in the

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,390
future releases so it's better to get

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,550
the development and developers feedback

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,620
on this so yeah so I am Sancho Adri I

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,810
work with the federal engineering team

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,670
and I'm also working with the federal

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,459
kuru ace team currently I have been a

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,980
Python developer for around 10 years now

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,600
and recently with the federal working

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,930
with red of guru stream I started to

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,640
work on bowling projects as well and

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:35,280
yoga is my twitter handle so options

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,989
right now we have a bunch of options out

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,420
there we so this project was so around

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,580
Pitt so the projects are we started with

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,480
a project if you have hard known of his

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,459
a federal atomic so which was which are

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,350
two parts to it one was the atomic work

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,670
station and the other was the atomic

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:59,280
server project that we had and so after

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,190
the porous acquisition we violated the

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,230
name to silver blue and on the other

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,690
side also we have other projects like

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,550
container leanness which is gentle base

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,150
we also have endless OS which is they've

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,450
been based but because Federer is part

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,280
of my occupational hazard so I went

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:24,419
ahead with using Federer silver blue so

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:27,440
yeah so I start off with introducing

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,990
Federer silver blue now

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,000
so yeah so the main part is it is based

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,430
out of federal so you have all your

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,889
options in place it's RP in base so

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,169
anything that you so the migration if

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,139
you do from fedorov traditional federal

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,300
always to silver blue it won't be a much

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,490
of a difference you would see everything

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,770
as like almost same it won't feel like

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,979
you have migrated to a completely new

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:55,050
territory but they are few close to it

00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,300
also like transits again on the

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,669
development side so you might be finds

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:06,810
of pain points but it's usually not that

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:09,840
much so again we since I have been using

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,659
federal for like I started in 2010 so

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,270
it's been my de-facto OS for a couple of

00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:18,360
years now and that's why I like I trust

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,909
federal I use petrol based operating

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:28,860
systems in my servers or be it my

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:33,630
desktop right now yeah so yeah so one of

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:37,139
the main thing about silver-blue is by

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:40,500
if you see the traditional federal OS

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,509
it's like so if you walk on a server

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,570
suppose you have walking on a server and

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,180
you usually have ansible playbooks in

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,610
place suit in to maintain that integrity

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,039
so that when you want to upgrade your

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,210
servers you want that to happen in a

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,870
proper way

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,440
you have playbooks or blake in place so

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,319
one of the thing is you don't want to

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:07,259
touch something in production and break

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,180
it right so when you doing some light

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,190
coating you usually have some testing in

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,110
placing a staging and then everything is

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,139
right you move your code to production

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:19,380
so why not move all those things to your

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,900
workstation as well as I used to work

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,440
with my traditional federal oh is in

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,509
that case I used to random use like if I

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,460
want to install a package is to download

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,860
random packages or off the internet some

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,270
random table or go through the readme

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,960
and style copying a copy pasting all the

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,219
files into different locations and what

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,699
happens after

00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:46,979
you hit a staff you can't do anything

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,529
right after that or the package breaks

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:53,969
or if it's not working so you just need

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:56,279
the computer in that state where it has

00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:59,459
random files which are kind of junk and

00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,679
no use to you and similarly if you see

00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,779
from the RPM side when you do a DNF

00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:06,869
install it's kind of dangerous because

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,869
you are changing files which are

00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:12,300
actually running a system so it can

00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:14,189
cause troubles to you and one of the

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,589
reasons for me I would say one of the

00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:19,229
example i fear'd upgrade in federal was

00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:21,389
what happens if the power goes off and

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,089
Bangalow is quite famous for its power

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,339
outages so I used to fear like what

00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:29,669
happens if the power goes off and my DNF

00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,819
upgrade is in place my system would

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:36,169
completely be in a state where I cannot

00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:39,269
even boot my system so in that case

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:42,629
those are things had to be thought of in

00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:45,689
some way or the other so this is one

00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:52,110
thing that silver-blue totally addresses

00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:53,969
it so you have transactional updates so

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,569
just one thing that I wanted to show

00:07:53,969 --> 00:08:00,569
this is reported by one of the QA he is

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:03,329
one of the go-to person in the federal

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,399
queue adam williamson he posted like do

00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:08,309
not upgrade your system while running

00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,379
DNA from a desktop so this is a block

00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:14,969
that he did it is except from his block

00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,589
so he as a QA person who is the most

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,709
experienced probably in the federal

00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:21,209
queue he is telling people that not to

00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,839
rerun DNS right now because there are a

00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:29,339
few issues so these are the things which

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:31,889
can cause trouble in the long run so so

00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,709
one other thing is like if you are

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,709
looking for a more stable system I would

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:42,079
say like this is the path we should be

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,079
going ahead with our system in general

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,180
the next thing is immutability and

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:54,920
isolation so as I told you I used to use

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:58,370
vagrant boxes and at the end of the day

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,140
the vagrant boxes wear something I used

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,110
because I did not want to touch my booth

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,020
system and this goes through back to my

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,700
using virtually and B in Python so the

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,830
reason for virtually envy is that I

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,740
don't want to keep installed as a root

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,080
user into my big host machine because

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,880
passing the packages can be dangerous

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,590
you cannot trust the package completely

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,290
and what if the there was the issue with

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,240
shish cheese for show up in Python that

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,210
they were a few malicious packages that

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,250
came in into the cheese shop so you

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,920
might be installing by mistake some

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,580
malicious packages that would target

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,500
your host system so that's where I

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,350
started to use virtual env and later

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,220
down the line vagrant boxes where I

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:50,420
separately like I I have like probably a

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,190
couple of packages like my editor a

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,860
couple of packages like my virtual

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,210
machines set up and my editor and all

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,280
those things in place but other than

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,190
that all the projects environment are

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,610
there in the vagrant boxes so another

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:08,390
beneficial thing for this setup is that

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:11,000
you can so probably it can be like a

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,130
project a can require a version of a

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,840
package which is an older version of

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,180
that particular dependent package which

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,810
is the dependency and on the other side

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,180
you have on a package which is another

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,220
project which requires a new version or

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,050
a dependency so you cannot install the

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,270
same package with two different versions

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,230
so in that if you go ahead with using

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:35,690
virtual ends or variant boxes so and so

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,430
this is one of the thing for isolation

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,840
as a developer we always go for

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,370
isolation this is very common scenario

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,140
and this can be totally be handled by a

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,380
container which is a more lighter weight

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:53,030
solution to this problem and then comes

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:55,610
the immutability part so this issue was

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,620
posted a couple couple of years back

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,890
where the author actually

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,380
by mistake put a space in between the

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,410
command slow so at the end of the day it

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,290
was like our MRF instead of slash user

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,650
slash limp it was slash it was

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,220
completely deleting the USR directory so

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:18,470
this was a big risk and what if you are

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,380
on your host machine if you run this

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,690
command you're like if you see that this

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,510
actually caught issue to a lot of people

00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,290
and by the emojis that if see that it

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:32,540
was like very famous issue at that time

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:35,380
so these are problems usually come and

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,420
like we are humans we do mistakes and

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,970
because of B's mistake it's usually the

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,630
host machine is getting affected so in

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,240
silver blue we have only the VAT and

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,890
Etsy directory is only writable and all

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,590
the other system is kind of in the

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,590
read-only mode so there is only one

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:58,970
thing that the option that is left to

00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:01,580
you is using container so the prompt so

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,650
silver blue bias nature promotes you to

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,730
use more of container based development

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:11,420
so you can be using each and every

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,210
application within the within and apply

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:19,430
a container framework be it your browser

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:22,670
be it your beat your maybe your servers

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:31,580
and etc so you it forces you to kind of

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:34,490
use the container environment so this is

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:38,120
one of now going into the internals of

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:41,260
the project the project heavily uses a

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,450
pmos tree which is kind of the core of

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,660
the syllable project and it's the same

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:50,180
for the federal core us also and what is

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,050
a famous tree so our team OS 3 is built

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,360
around the act so if you go by how the

00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:01,910
project is built is basically it uses

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,850
ellipse limo history project which kind

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,370
of what it does to your system is that

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,710
it makes your complete system at as a

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:13,380
kid version system so you

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,660
basically have a couple of versions to

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:23,040
your system and I'll just give you a

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:27,510
small demo around it so is this is this

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,370
visible yeah so if you see like this is

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,670
if you see this dot this is the current

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,970
system that is running and there is hash

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:41,400
to it so because this is a content

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:44,160
addressable object so what it does is

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,260
that it for every deployment that you do

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,330
it downloads the RPM creates an image

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,750
out of it hashes all the files see if

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,820
the files are reduplicated or not in

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,210
that case it intelligently solves the

00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:01,650
issue of not downloading the same files

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,990
again and again and does and also why I

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:08,010
hardly it does not it's kind of we

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:11,520
duplicate the file so basically you have

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,190
this hash in place and this is the

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,440
current system I am in and this is the

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,660
older system my name in so when you do

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,040
ask me a mystery upgrade so what happens

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,040
is that it does not affect your current

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,370
system and in place it creates a new

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,020
deployment this is like you would see in

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,390
that case three deployments and then

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,700
when you do a reboot of the system you

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:36,240
would finally migrate into the newer OS

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,370
and if the new OS breaks you also you

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,830
usually have the option you have the

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:46,680
option to migrate into the older one so

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:49,650
and silver-blue comes with a base base

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,130
image OS and on top of that if you see

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,290
these are the these are the are fiends

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,370
is these are the fields that are

00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,110
installed so it works as a layer so it

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,310
if you know about the container layer

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:09,840
system it keeps on layering the new rpm

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:11,550
SATA install so this gives you a good

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,350
idea on which of the packages are

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,030
installed in your system you can always

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:20,610
override them or remove them and and

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:24,540
that would make your system kind of

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,580
atomic in nature so

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,200
if you want to so if two machines have

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,850
the same package installed you probably

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,990
would get the same box if you have and

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:37,560
you can probably go ahead and file those

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,240
issues and another thing is if you see

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,950
these are the local packages so these

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,920
are the packages that I did not install

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,770
fraud these are the packages I did not

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,600
install from directly from the federal

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:52,020
rapport and then I installed it locally

00:15:48,600 --> 00:16:02,070
so this gives you put overview on how

00:15:52,020 --> 00:16:04,350
the system works so moving ahead so how

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,380
does this help a developer as a

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,330
developer if I am preaching a syllable

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,430
to you so these are the things that what

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,320
you would be finding it useful this

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,720
mostly comes with all the container

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,320
engine they stock with this form and I

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,060
personally use apartment for the non non

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,640
hoopla for the rootless containers

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,770
because and also part one is very light

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,930
because it has the daemon list

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,520
it runs daemon list so you in the

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,700
offering at the daemon running

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,490
continuously so I personally use pod

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,550
vent for all my containers and then you

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,620
have builder I have not used it much but

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:43,350
I have heard a lot from the people it

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:48,210
basically creates a OCA images for you

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:50,730
and the next thing is scope you so scope

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:56,220
is another project built by ready to

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:59,160
inspect and manage your images so these

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,740
all projects come with along with the

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,720
syllable project another concept with

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,220
comes that has been introduced with

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,079
silver blue is kind of called a thread

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,820
containers so Pater containers has

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,500
basically like I probably would have

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,280
containers for different projects but

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,589
what if I need a container which does a

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,150
lot of stuff for maybe it can be a

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,040
regular container for me like in

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,500
virtually envy I used to have a temper

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,100
chill and values I usually just install

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,199
random packages in it just to ought to

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,090
test things in it so read containers is

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,550
very well managed by this project or

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,560
toolboxes still in a have every heavy

00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:38,000
development stage so a lot of things

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,000
would be coming in in the future

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,320
the next thing is flat back so if you

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,990
have heard of flat faxes basically a lot

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,080
of apps are getting migrated into flat

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,950
packs and so you have the flattop from

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:56,340
where you can install this install the

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,920
application via flat pack and like

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,490
probably for me like most of the

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,410
probably the PDF reader or the maybe the

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,170
Spotify client all are running from my

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:11,730
laptop is running via flat pack and it

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:16,170
has a vast the flat hub actually

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:20,150
contains a vast appala it has a lot of

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:24,000
application in there to installed and

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:27,660
the future plans for like we are getting

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,760
more rpm OS 3 support and platform into

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,010
the genomes or software so you can

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,830
directly install it via the bloom

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,810
Software Center and then we would be

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:41,220
doing a federal tool was released with

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,930
more development in place and right now

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,580
flat packs are not installed directly on

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,020
the silver-blue so probably down the

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,240
line when we are doing the final release

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,060
you would be finding flat packs as a

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,340
part of the release itself and we are

00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,340
looking for faster downloads so that the

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,590
downloads that happens and so the

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,180
chemistry downloads that happen to a

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,730
syllable we are trying to make in more

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,100
optimized and faster right now it kind

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,810
of takes more time than DNF but we are

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,110
looking for a more faster download in

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:13,590
that case and in a distant future plan

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,690
we would be having more pillbox

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,000
integration basically you would so if

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,560
you are you basically if you are on your

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,270
terminal so there would be kind of a

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,640
visual difference on if you are inside

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,710
your container or not re re on a post or

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,890
not so those all things we would be

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,700
working on in the future releases there

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,170
would be we would be targeting more

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,510
containers available to the community is

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,220
like probably make things around it and

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:45,590
have like tensorflow

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,970
container or like maybe a image

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,340
processing containers in place so that

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,270
it becomes easier for people to use

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,840
sailor blue on it

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,690
rather than writing the aquifers or

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,820
creating the containers from scratch and

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,110
right now like using Chrome and

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:06,990
VirtualBox are kind of difficult to use

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:09,150
because of the display he uses so in

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,630
that case we would be trying to have

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:16,590
more difficult country containers for

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,929
the community done by the people who are

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,429
building silver-blue itself so it's

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,480
basically towards the end we are trying

00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:26,340
to have a more better UX and UI for the

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,210
general public and we are trying to mean

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:35,460
like the silver blue as the de-facto

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:37,800
workstation for fedora so now what so

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,920
going forward how can you contact us so

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:47,520
we have a discard sorry

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:49,679
it's and yes so we have decision door

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,480
shredder project at our you are where

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,010
you can post your comments in there we

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,320
have silver blue dot federal project at

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,720
all where we usually have questions in

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,309
place so if you are new to silver blue

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,210
you can just go in there ask the

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:04,860
questions or since everybody is starting

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,600
out with silver blue there are quite

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,640
common questions for me starting as a

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,559
newbie I found a couple of questions

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,929
there itself in the community platform

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,350
or even directly go to silver blue on

00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:19,880
freenode IRC join them and you can

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,880
probably ask a question in there itself

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:27,260
so questions yeah

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,559
so you can so the question is like can

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,059
the silver-blue gives you something from

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,070
the waist level to launch your

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:27,480
application all you have to do it

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:31,260
manually right so we don't have we right

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,429
now so what I do is I some I have kind

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,840
of make files in place so what I do is

00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:38,250
using those make files I manage my

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,929
container is basically running the

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,760
quadrant containers itself probably in

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:44,400
the future we can have those GUI

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,870
supports so that even through GUI use

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
actually running the container that

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:51,030
could be a better approach but right now

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,160
it just plain and I use myself a lot of

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,309
make files in that case and run those

00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:15,960
management containers to attach or start

00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:17,730
or run those containers yeah flat pack

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,410
would like you can search it through

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:25,530
your chrome search bar and install them

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,830
you can start those applications so that

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,830
would be

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:56,360
so we are probably deprecating those so

00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,880
basically we are deprecating you won't

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,440
have those alpha beta channels like in

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,630
your OS yeah but in silver blue it's you

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,580
can just you have the image so we

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:11,180
usually in federal have composes which

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:14,480
happens on a daily basis and how federal

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:18,020
boxes we usually have this row height or

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,030
the stable one so you can initially do a

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,060
few moisty upgrade and whatever packages

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:26,450
are there which happened there in the

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:29,060
upgrade in that particular but OS in

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,190
that day probably it would just download

00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,590
it and relayer it over on top of it so

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,870
yeah but we don't have those different

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,990
channel and scene II after this we'll be

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:41,120
talking about federal kudos on how we

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:48,290
migrating to form contending as to the

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:57,740
federal chorus project in general any

00:24:48,290 --> 00:25:00,770
more questions I don't think so in is

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,590
there is any limit on their packages but

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,390
usually layer pair it's recommended to

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,340
use more of containers other than layer

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,610
packages that's what I have read from

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:19,100
the got it from the discussions and the

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:20,510
blogs that I read so yeah so if you have

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,110
questions you can probably drop me an

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:26,480
email or ping me on Twitter so that's

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:31,090
the end of the top who pleaded good

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,090
