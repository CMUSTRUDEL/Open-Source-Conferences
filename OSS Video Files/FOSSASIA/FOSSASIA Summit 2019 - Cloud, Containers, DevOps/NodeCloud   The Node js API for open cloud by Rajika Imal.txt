Organizations move to open cloud solutions based on certain advantages of combining multiple services of different cloud providers. NodeCloud is an open source project which unifies the API layer to simply application layer API contracts and provisioning. The talk will deliver the design and development methodology of NodeCloud library.

With the advent of multiple cloud providers with similar services, many projects tend to use different services from many providers due to certain advantages. API contracts of cloud providers tend to differ in major ways and this leads to slower development and bad developer experience. NodeCloud is an open source solution which unifies the API layer in Node.js runtime. API contracts in NodeCloud make it easier to consume same types of services in different providers with common API semantics.
