The key idea of property based testing is that rather than writing a test that tests just a single scenario, you write tests that describe a range of scenarios and then let the computer explore the possibilities for you rather than having to hand-write every one yourself.Think of a normal unit test (example-based) as being something like the following:
1. Set up some data.
2. Perform some operations on the data.
3. Assert something about the result.

Using property-based tests, your approach will look like this:
1. For all data matching some specification.
2. Perform some operations on the data.
3. Assert something about the result.

In this talk, I'll share on the following:
