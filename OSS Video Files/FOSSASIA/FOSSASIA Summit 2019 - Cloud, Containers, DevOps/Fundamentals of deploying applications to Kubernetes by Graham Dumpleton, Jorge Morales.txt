A hot topic in recent years is running applications in containers. Tools such as docker have made deployment of applications using Linux containers easier, but they do not alone provide everything that is needed to easily manage many applications, or run containers at scale across a cluster of machines.

In this hands on workshop you will learn about the fundamental concepts and terminology around deploying applications to Kubernetes and why it is emerging as the de-facto standard for container orchestration and scheduling.

Topics which will be covered to illustrate how Kubernetes works will include:

What are containers and pods.
Accessing pods for an application via a service.
Scaling up applications to many instances.
Automatic recovery from application failure.
Exposing a web application to the public.
Application lifecycle management.
Monitoring health of an application.
If you attend the workshop, you will be provided access to an online workshop environment with everything you need already setup and installed, but you will need to bring your own laptop in order to access the online environment. You will not need to install anything on your laptop and will be able to jump straight into getting hands on with Kubernetes.
