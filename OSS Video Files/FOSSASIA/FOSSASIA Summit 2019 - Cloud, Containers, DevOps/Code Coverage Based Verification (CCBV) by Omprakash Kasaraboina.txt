Continuous testing is an important aspect of DevOps. It is primarily related to Verification & Validation.

Verification – Are we building the product right?Validation – Are we building the right product?

With Agile principle in place, when we release a Minimum Viable Product to the customers, we get a feedback that helps us with validation. While validation is important and the core emphasis of practices like DoD, Acceptance criteria, System Demo.

What is equally important is to have a scientific way to verify that we are building the product right. Let us evaluate the relevance of code-coverage based verification at system testing. While code coverage is extensively used during unit testing phase, rarely do we use this technique at system testing.

Code Coverage Based Verification (CCBV) will help us accomplish1. Test suite comprehensiveness2. Reduction in technical debt

In addition to this, it will also help us with1. E2E Requirement traceability matrix (RTM)2. Regression test suite preparation
