In any observability stack, the “last mile” of metrics, or application metrics, can often be the hardest to get. Platforms expose a variety of different metrics about the underlying performance of the hardware (virtualized or otherwise), but may not easily expose and collect application level metrics to understand the performance of our application code. In this talk, we will cover:
The open source project Prometheus for exposing and collecting metrics.
How Prometheus democratizes metric collection by creating a standard way of adding metrics to code, exposing the metrics for collection, and collection and storage of these metrics.
Graphing and reporting of application metrics with Grafana.
Solutions for long term storage of Prometheus metrics.
Attendees will learn how to implement performance metrics for their own code base, and how Prometheus (along with Open Metrics) has become the standard for exposing application level metrics.
