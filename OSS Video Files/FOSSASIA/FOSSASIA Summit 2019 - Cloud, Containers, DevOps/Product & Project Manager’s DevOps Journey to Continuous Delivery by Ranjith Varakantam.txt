What do product and project managers do when waterfall goes away? How did our customers/users react to this transition? What changes did we bring about?  and How long did it take us to get here? This talks presents our journey with our customers/users in Red Hat Developers Group.

Our approach to bridge the gap between Dev & Ops was to  give the teams not only the ability to build, deploy the code to production but also manage the service delivery aspects. We even managed to incorporate end-user feedback into our continuous delivery model.

This talk will review how we crossed the following hurdles.

‘Culture follows structure’ hence org change from two different Dev & Ops departments to just one

Transition from just building products to running and managing services in production.

Release schedules didn’t disappear, they simply served as a marker on our continuous delivery path.

Continue to focus on reducing dependency on Service Delivery teams - balancing access & security.

Invested in building toolchains that minimized and automated efforts to build, deploy &  maintain code.

Continuous feedback channels such as user behaviour via telemetry, stability via monitoring tools etc.

Redefined business value by focusing on flexible architecture that allows for easy extensibility via plugins.

Engagement with community & customers via several touch points and direct access to developers.
