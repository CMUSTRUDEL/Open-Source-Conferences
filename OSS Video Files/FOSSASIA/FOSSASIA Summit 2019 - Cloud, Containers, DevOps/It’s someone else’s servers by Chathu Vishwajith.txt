Serverless and micro-services now being evolving and many providers have been introduced services and frameworks to creating Serverless applications. I will talk about how the industry evolved to Serverless and when It’s useful. WebTask.io is a new Serverless provider who supports Node version 8 out of the box. WebTask can use as code sandbox for Node.js applications. WebTask also can be used to create scheduled tasks and Webhooks with Node.js. I had a chance to work with WebTask on beta phase so I would like to share my knowledge and some demos I have created to the Audience.
