In 17media, we are currently facing C10K average traffic.

The sudden burst of traffic can easily go beyond our system scaling ability and threaten our backend stability.

In order to cope with the unpredictable burst, we had used redis to implement a low-cost, simple but elegant solution for rate limiting.

isolation they making a some event which

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:24,600
case are as the best of all user well

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:28,619
why why it makes enough with troubles to

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,219
our company because after it if the

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,350
person of abuser is pyramid at all we

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,800
can just alter with the machine in

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,140
advice but the first is a little bit

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,410
more and this we can know is always open

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,420
a lot of depression or otherwise the

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:52,890
seven cost with me and ask us and this

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:55,530
others feeling is not possible you may

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,199
wonder death I can always I can open a

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,969
lot of other side easy question within

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:06,299
the same database the stage in enemies

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,060
is very hard you can open a virtual

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,990
machine but you have to fill in the

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,670
basement data

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:20,369
it means especially with nobody being

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,890
especially our MongoDB is supported by

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,119
some third party it's quite hard to

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,860
change them as a contract and this our

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:36,840
only solution if this sudden burst of

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:40,710
incoming user and it is much beyond the

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,799
server capacity we can only say sorry -

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,110
positive - some of us a blueprint help

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,110
our system is there not total attention

00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:57,319
you make us if there is not much more

00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,170
user using engine next using engine as

00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:05,060
always limiting in is enough why you

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,350
have to but so a lot of work I can only

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,369
help you there

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:13,010
our company although is major business

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,750
is swimming performance but there is a

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:20,959
lot of minigame minigame in our apps

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:24,530
user user can pay a minigames of

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,280
activity for 30 minute you can imagine

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:31,849
that if you do if you start again and

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,310
suddenly you are you you cannot connect

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,670
to our server because of weights limit

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,819
then you will you will be very very

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,310
angry because your you you can come in

00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:51,340
your game especially such game as score

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:57,500
and is during ways limiting instead of

00:02:51,340 --> 00:03:01,639
perform 20 when random from prop came to

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,790
random user we and now we are now

00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:10,959
existing user to continue them their

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,959
game while rocking the new user

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:21,709
translator will happen when we we use we

00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:25,609
use the exact hotel to distinguish the

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:29,209
user when the when we found that the

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:33,290
total number of active using access

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:38,540
token is more than text the server will

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:41,540
enter system program ball in system in

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,030
system but what are involved we will

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,180
perform a champion for all for all

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:51,540
impressed with them SSO can

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,140
as up here has used in the in the

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,379
previous 30 minutes we consider this

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:02,310
assessment is using use the five

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:06,799
existing user agreement we allow it with

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:11,189
the SS doctrine is not used previously

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:22,500
calculus we simply brought in a meter or

00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:24,449
two nine too many requests here is out

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,020
we miss your apology

00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:31,740
it's definitely very but I want to our

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:41,009
new ceramics as an example how to reduce

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:44,639
redness incorrectly first to elevate to

00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:48,270
no access token is boosted people's

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,180
different 30 minutes as a very very

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,970
simple solution is we use pepper cream

00:04:51,180 --> 00:05:00,419
we use the access token as a king as a

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:05,610
story in Brenda's and set the TTL 30

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:08,250
minute if the if the if the system

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,330
entire system for involved with we just

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:16,830
check if as hotel has corresponding

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:23,009
kidnap exist in arrest and we sorted all

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:27,570
but this approach as a problem is we are

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:31,320
unable to tell what way sternum with the

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:36,270
number of active assess okay in a server

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:40,940
and this another enemy another problem

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:47,159
is the keyword in Vegas has much higher

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:51,300
memory between them - cell and this we

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:55,710
use action instead of key value to score

00:05:51,300 --> 00:06:02,419
several such kill as a spoken a

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:06,090
and fellas you can I use this example

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:13,470
you can see them in a 30-minute weekly

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:18,539
era we create a hashtag if there is a if

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:21,419
there is a new access token continuous

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:26,310
commitment to our system we put the

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,800
access token in intruder into the

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,030
hashtag we are currently using Excel

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,169
called a hazard but as I spoke and be

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:40,560
his last of the is last usage time

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:44,160
estimate is to hug them and if the

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,260
system suddenly John phone go home the

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:53,340
mobile to sister Cotton Bowl will we

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,360
when we sing up access from hand we just

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,400
need to check the current the current

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,949
hashtag and the previous hashtag and see

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:15,830
if this passion as usage within the

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:15,830
previous per minute a simple evening

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:28,820
why is fair system ring esse why we want

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,580
to come see system for trade reform

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:35,630
system for train is to hold temple our

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:39,560
our internal seven can hold against the

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:43,670
first of target but in the BC in the

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,270
ratio emotional every happy request

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:53,360
during sampling sputtering to ask for

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:57,340
their birthdays if such if such has

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:04,310
appeared as used in 30 minutes

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:08,950
I repeat but in one we want to confirm

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:12,980
system muttering because because because

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,070
the best is totally compatible if we

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:20,600
allow water traffic go into our alpha

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:23,690
and alpha and and resulted in outage and

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,150
this released some mechanism our

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,420
internal internal parent component for

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:33,470
example wettest Vlasic search on to

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:37,160
their base my signal against such happen

00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:40,419
and this why we civil is a very other

00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:44,150
this is a failed design because it with

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,400
SS the wettest for everyone has to

00:08:44,150 --> 00:09:01,570
income system country involved and it

00:08:46,400 --> 00:09:01,570
remains so crash in the rest because the

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,750
investors in the wettest customer

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,010
environment autumn you can have a lot

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:16,130
you know in the wettest has started but

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:21,080
one one has what there is only stored in

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:24,710
one word it means that during the 40 to

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,220
the system 1400 such market will come

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,230
into one where desk estando

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:36,860
and every we thought

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:40,280
one such such auto window in Venice

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,200
Hestia others will be long normal but

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:48,890
even ten when is in the half ended up in

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,640
in the nucleus sort and has said it will

00:09:48,890 --> 00:10:01,850
be overwhelmed with a lot of heartache

00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:10,970
and case in case outage and this is the

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:14,750
we when we are we using first I repeat

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:18,730
out I'll go first

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:21,890
when wettest is one of them our kicks

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,960
component in the back end it must be

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,770
protec an arcane such pairs of the

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:34,360
target it means that no man no man no

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,360
matter no matter yes our our our

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:43,070
awareness people such as not talking and

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:49,190
this we need to we need a mechanism to

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:52,750
understand if I have been used with with

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:57,950
in previous 30 minutes without without

00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:00,650
without acids on weather and this we

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,800
need to use them we need to use local

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:08,360
memory local memory to store such

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:12,320
assessed but everyone knows in a

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:16,370
vacations about local memory this is not

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,740
if it is not unlimited and this we need

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:24,340
we need some constant know who memory

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:27,860
usage mechanism Sims mission impossible

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:32,050
my boss always one byte was always one

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,050
ship one keep server so happy

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:49,850
how it seems impossible but it's

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:54,140
possible computer computer I want to be

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:59,750
inside this white spoon first it has

00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:07,370
constant memory usage if if you you

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:12,320
create with your p / the memory usage

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:15,730
and this is the beta's okay you can

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:26,690
perform you can add a string into that

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:29,690
and then you can test if however you

00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,640
know take is constant memory usage it

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,090
means that they must be actually a

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,520
constant memory you say means that then

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:44,330
in stop I think it's a tiny with

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:49,850
positive thoughts positive IRA discuss

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:53,530
more about and one key important key

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:57,680
important features the computer support

00:12:53,530 --> 00:13:00,440
epoxy my hands although it's not it's

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,170
not accept everything but it can tell

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,960
you the approximate number of item

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:15,400
within that structure and it's a virtual

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,400
the motion is very very fast

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:29,630
why computer is so helpful

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:33,470
first the most positive if it is

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,650
concluded in in a low weight waste it

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:41,000
it's not even hotter because if voice

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:44,990
any hope even if your capacity can

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,850
support 10 meeting us so 10,000 use

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,840
allows supporting supporting 10,000 and

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:56,050
extrao 20 kind

00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:59,690
is not met her house when I keep on the

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:03,200
server capacity is a PD find is that

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:08,990
people divide a number a number and and

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:16,700
in Bulgaria the the post positive lumber

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:19,520
is by the memory foot pain we stop in

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,790
the beginning it means that we can be

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,430
given black in African if flash in our

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:29,660
memory help a five hours it actually

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:33,520
side capacity and this if we can always

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:40,089
keep those first photographs between up

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,089
with in a suitable not lumber you know

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:56,740
if we won simplified you can see that

00:14:53,529 --> 00:15:00,020
there is a lot of applications

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:04,190
previously I had mentioned the pool Utah

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:07,790
is started in in local memory of every

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:12,589
application server and this stays on top

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:15,920
if you say if you say a go into tester

00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:19,640
to another server one we take a

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,680
mechanism to synchronizing ISTEP SS

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:25,070
token to all of the application server

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:29,630
otherwise if you just go into the server

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:33,530
one and next index ten minutes he go

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:39,560
into the server he will be followed

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:42,260
because is synchronous and this what

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,310
ways the role of greatest here and

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:50,680
greatest is okay this is a case of face

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:57,440
of thing centralized the store store age

00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:00,410
in epics in every second the abuse in

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,540
server will chide me home from a sting

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,810
operation increased in the same

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,710
operation it does

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:12,530
get us master copy in the red test and

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:17,210
try to back and try to merge the master

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:20,420
copy local copy and then merge after

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:29,470
merging it will they will put back the

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:32,870
master copy back into it and this is

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:53,120
after two seconds it will be it will be

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:56,480
operated our you can ask why we use

00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,100
wetness instead of other instead of

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,850
other controller one key part is almost

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:08,390
almost a pipette and they use what is a

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:12,620
special it means that if we use wet as

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:15,680
as a same centralized storage we have no

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,260
external and component no paint

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:23,000
component means that those special

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:25,910
approval from our posts and and one more

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,140
important is no extra people from our si

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:40,010
with him I should not discuss our so

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:43,790
much when important point is pivoted

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:47,480
previously I deeply I do not tell you

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:53,390
what is exactly stored in the cumin in

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:55,460
the red in the red as you can see in

00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,890
every second every every application

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,980
server we try to synchronize is don't

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:04,520
poke me with Krypton wear this mask if

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,620
then there is a brace for the option in

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,100
order to out in order to avoid the risk

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,000
condition or domestic or not exclusive

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,290
to pour them against saturated condition

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,900
this instead of interesting

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:22,130
key value to Spartan to post order to

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:31,280
content

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:31,280
reduce reuse a help we used said instead

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:45,110
in the in the TS campaign film it's used

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,110
at all

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:56,970
it means that it would try to prep the

00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,530
master copy to merge with the local copy

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,870
and texting to the map and faxing

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:07,800
wetness if the time scam it will spell

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,840
stem is contact it was very prepped the

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:16,920
master copy again to reach hide

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:19,590
operation because we need to use the

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,040
automatic lock can come at the mix

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:27,720
o'clock came one of the key honest check

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:29,430
check and set so we need to use Lois

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:37,400
script to do a price of the operation

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:44,490
but is very simple Louisville in our

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:47,220
more about our illusions to poll in our

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,520
application server tase tase thousands

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:54,390
of out incoming requests in epic every

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:58,260
second every second will try to read and

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,640
write to the local in the dog local

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,080
memory local memory

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,850
this if we lick to yours meanwhile of

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,170
online for the conference Karen

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,470
concurrency control in the application

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:16,860
server the rewind law allow us to

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:19,710
perform mode multi-factor test because

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:27,890
test is a real operation and single

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:27,890
practice up to the performance

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:41,990
the update why because in every week as

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:43,970
we the requests do not need to waste do

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,860
not need to reach for the point you have

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:50,240
to be completed before every time

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,070
faculty higher and this we our

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,929
application server is writing in

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,370
language in : question there is up a

00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,190
structure called much for the channel

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:08,270
for 4f4

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:10,970
all the requests will just put we will

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:17,330
just put that as I stopped Canada into

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:21,950
into that candle to slowly get to slowly

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,460
from the handle and to an effect to the

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:36,640
pump

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:39,460
I can see some some of you is currently

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,650
performing with heat media on the layer

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:49,790
on the palm to data structure and you

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:53,270
may wonder this operation there is no

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:58,640
expired opponent and look T do operation

00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:03,650
in computer and this how can we resolve

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,290
it instead instead of instead of

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,260
recreating another computer and

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:13,100
appreciate as paper if we do not have

00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,919
enough time and this we perform a single

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:20,450
particle working solution I think

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:26,110
everyone here use the need next right

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:27,290
right no one use window ask your server

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,260
ok

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,200
I think everyone knows waste not lock

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,640
rotation lock rotation means that for

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,550
example Hachi will will write a lot of

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:45,050
long and every day

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:48,020
every day with a lit the oldest the

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:52,190
mister on his block POW everywhere and I

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:57,200
create new one for new current day

00:22:52,190 --> 00:23:00,890
and this hot applause rotation the

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:06,290
non-vocational also can also hide on the

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,720
computer and this instead you know in

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:17,740
our Doku application survive instead of

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:21,530
the computer we create a filter in every

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:24,380
second we remove the oldest computer

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:33,680
object and we create a new one and this

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:36,650
and this if SS has not used in 30

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:44,320
minutes it will finally it will finally

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:50,180
be removed in such an array of computer

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:54,620
and one more people is the SS program is

00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:56,810
absurd the latest computer and this not

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,390
all the computer needs to be single

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,210
maybe to be synchronized to be fantastic

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:08,960
only the currently using want me to be

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:12,860
synchronized with the rest he is our

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,070
here is our we want architecture in

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:21,290
detail you can see that inverter stereos

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:24,500
are not these are not of computer and

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:27,650
only third only the last one to come on

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:42,770
using one is synchronized multiple

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:45,970
multiple applications the women approach

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:51,890
some put on the hyper

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:53,910
FL during our peak hours one our

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,150
application server

00:24:53,910 --> 00:25:01,470
Villa will still offense even occurring

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:05,640
to our our dumbbell press and this

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:10,560
between the power our we open a lot of

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:14,970
read or we open a lot of top content na

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:17,490
how applications and this the

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,650
application sir so we all of the

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:23,550
evidence but we'll try to synchronize

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:29,310
with weather and one key point of about

00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:31,430
the optimistic lock that if let's

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:36,630
synchronize a contract increase

00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:39,870
exponentially with a vacation and this

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:46,610
once the applications number increased

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:50,670
and finally and finally a lot a lot of

00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:54,090
sync will fail because because it went

00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:57,900
from the web from the wettest and update

00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:00,360
and and the reckless master copy is

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,290
updated by other applications and

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:09,410
resulted in there and this le to web

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:13,170
again and finally because of such

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:16,560
conflict everything navigations about we

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:24,900
will try we try and we try and result in

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:28,050
abnormal high bandwidth using and in we

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:33,620
won in we one point one month whatever

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:41,490
age this will test a place like it on

00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:45,720
the automatic block algorithm because we

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:51,410
we do not have time to rewrite

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:55,310
everything much it means that the

00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:58,290
application server we will try to when I

00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:02,460
master couples on register and merge

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:07,380
with local coffee but but even if found

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:10,600
the look one if if conflict it means the

00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:15,940
when it's height alone it back to the

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:20,760
server if you have time if the master

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,760
copy is modified by other applications

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:31,900
and stop and stop the upload is it truly

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:37,090
better no because because because this

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:42,390
thing standing in everything second even

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:42,390
one or two iteration will fail but

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:54,580
eventually some in hand upload back into

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:56,880
the master copy so if it doesn't really

00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,880
matter

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:14,590
listen if you if if your system if

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:17,710
you're a period has me to assess the

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:20,370
reference for waste imaging is a

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:24,400
horrible thing here

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:32,500
your witness we will almost die in video

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:36,820
s similarly similarly before before the

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:39,370
before the age of three WT that the SS

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,570
hand is random strength right it means

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:47,290
that it means a random SSO can cannot

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:49,750
how we can hope is upgraded and we will

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:53,670
check it with the red ribbon either

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:57,040
wettest or or nice nice my bicycle

00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:59,370
bicycle to check that when I'm centering

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,270
is usually the part of our circle

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,200
however however this is a weakness to be

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:09,880
exploited back

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,700
iddo OS because indeed o OS I do not

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,340
need you if I do not use the three

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:19,090
document here I use web and I use friend

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:23,390
random string for SS program as the

00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:25,970
you can generate a lot from a lot a lot

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:28,039
of requests and do not need to not in

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:32,630
the system and every week quest will

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:38,860
title SS the red test - no no it is it

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:45,070
is a system can generate by our system

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:50,270
is not good and and when key policy

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:54,940
sweat test breath test has normally the

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:58,640
performance panel is a membrane or Never

00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,940
however be careful on the hot spot if

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,360
there is possible you want you want your

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,919
with with some some of the look in your

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:15,700
retinas pasta will have 100 cm usage and

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:19,460
case quick shuffle and 1k policy many

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:21,950
many many web developer they will they

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,440
were said that oh we can use some

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:28,220
library to buy some food some people

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,039
will call website all this we do not

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,409
need to pay attention to University cost

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,649
and do not need to pay attention to

00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:41,000
algorithm data structure I can show you

00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:44,000
yet no absolutely no no would compute at

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,789
a stock tribe is cost by 10 yes and high

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,140
university professor if I do not pay

00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:54,140
attention to that university course I

00:30:50,140 --> 00:31:07,630
will unable to to fulfill my possible

00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:11,750
Parma Moffitt in a well hi-hi QPS

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,770
consistency this sacrifice for sacrifice

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,100
for Petronas

00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:19,820
you can see that you know you know in

00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:24,880
our Moodle solution there is some false

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,880
positive on however if it is a matter

00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:34,809
and if your system is swerving and woven

00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:39,460
you may need to consider some trade-off

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:43,629
between consistency and performing and

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:51,609
when he asked Yvonne yes it is efficient

00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:55,299
use of local membrane s T of I cannot

00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:58,659
discuss our kicking in our vision

00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:02,499
however I can help you like that a lot a

00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:07,769
lot of us is fulfilled by local local

00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:12,249
memory in our in our applications

00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:17,589
because it because if we do not use the

00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:21,399
local operator hot hot hot

00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:23,919
the data the data used by a lot of user

00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,359
we become a high spot in momentum in the

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:32,190
respect Hestia every sultanate equation

00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:35,469
or even crack in the west coast and

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:42,129
taste a lot of time and this I want to

00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:48,399
show you some extra extra things in our

00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:56,070
company in our company our our patients

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:56,070
you use a minimum you need about the

00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:05,409
liter pot will store the users users the

00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:12,009
top two thousand years out you use a

00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:15,879
score and the score you usually pay is

00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:18,580
only increase the only difference is we

00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:23,440
found some user is chicken with aletheia

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,809
comity or or before we wrote back there

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,309
will go back to Scotland however is very

00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,309
differing abnormal

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,850
we went to ocean is convenient and we

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:44,560
will use the path and what epic mission

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:50,230
develop inverters days are there

00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:55,710
structures on a second we use the real

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:58,420
solution we stop we use them so test and

00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:02,470
store the user ID as the key and the

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:09,250
scores textures as the score in the

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:13,659
solder stand this to get the 2000 user

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:16,929
we can have can be get by range of

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,840
operation that's understand it's very

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:23,169
convenient and is our view and emotion

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:27,399
and finally arsenic arsenic again

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:32,159
because today's is possible today's hot

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:36,220
spot in our you know whether started 1-1

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,220
why not just because of we operate the

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:42,850
operation captain can be reduced by use

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:48,340
our local local local memory but when

00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:51,850
key point is big big after use I have

00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:56,530
finished again they need to update the

00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:59,590
way there that new store in this subtle

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:02,770
scent it means that subtle scent even

00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:06,400
come will become a single calling of all

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:19,140
user activities and it without it

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:23,530
without serious in vitro algorithm at F

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:27,840
in high performance we need to sacrifice

00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:36,000
on the bank instead of spoil tolling or

00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:36,000
800 user we only store the - mm mm I am

00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,950
why is important because the octave or

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:48,640
10 operation is in is a dot

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:54,280
operation store next item is on a step

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:58,150
we will obviously important comment it

00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:02,140
stay still problem but because of the

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:07,450
happy update and every week hospital s

00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:16,510
tip cause next time that the system

00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:18,880
performance has a lot and the top the

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:22,510
top it off we took compared to who we

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,470
are if we found these are using this I

00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:30,340
use a cheap pen and that is the tool if

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:34,600
cop without top two thousand user the

00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,230
whole holiness it will be little be

00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,190
refused

00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:44,770
come on men their base because if I

00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:48,670
paste it is I use a chicken taste and we

00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:52,090
constantly taste no don't mm record in

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:54,160
DeSoto said and of course we did to fill

00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:57,280
in the data from arming their base which

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:03,910
is very costly but it went very happen

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:15,070
and then to to truly stop them to truly

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:20,560
stop them if you want shading instead of

00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:24,340
snow tolling the data as done as 1 1 G

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:28,270
welcome peaceful we have restored it

00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:31,150
into we start with the data in your

00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:35,260
eight it has shape an epithet estate

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:39,310
honey and only to copy the data straight

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:42,280
is certified user ID lipoma and define

00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:46,150
tension on the user ID and and then

00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:50,320
modify h5h we use the women Romina

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:56,380
number two to determine which shape is

00:37:50,320 --> 00:38:02,350
to be put into and it straight on has

00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:07,960
only two tonypop 4,000 4,000 poison in

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:11,500
every week in every week in in the

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,410
request we will simply we will simply

00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,930
get the date of the order a shade and

00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:21,370
then perform and have on some time in

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:28,420
the application server or to you can you

00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:31,720
can think is a stupid but which we might

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:38,380
wait I don't postpone the single spot

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:42,940
album into a smaller and finally me I

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:47,020
cannot disclose after which they pick

00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:52,300
enough number if we sorted which we sort

00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:55,600
of cobble and instead of using instead

00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,470
of using solder said what I said we use

00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,740
that we use handset

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,500
because update and handshape expect a

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:10,240
1-1 the update and solder step is big

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:12,790
old rock n and if we can't is the

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:23,970
performance of commentating increased

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:30,540
positive and after we get agree so

00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:37,480
sorted certainly the part we will report

00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:46,170
without we saw in into enna greatest key

00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:46,170
well in 4k yes if some exercise for you

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:54,970
of course everyone here I think no voice

00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:57,880
at event here and will be empty but it's

00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:01,810
in some case we do not need we do not

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,280
need to perform what Horan Horan to

00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,790
operation

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:12,130
can we use the redness to perform to

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:16,900
perform some task you must know

00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,380
operation with apparent people passed by

00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,350
already

00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:26,640
I repeat shuttle said to be our in our

00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:33,670
cross because it involved not but not an

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:36,790
operation this end of my presentation I

00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,950
know my English is poor and I'm too

00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,260
nervous

00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,970
hopefully you can it hopefully I wish

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,020
you can get something from mine is an

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:52,150
Asian and Mike I will put a slide in my

00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:56,800
di MIT how about Hank you can search you

00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:58,960
can search Triton hole in impede hop and

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,530
if you have any question want to ask me

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,220
you can search Triton hole in Facebook

00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:11,270
and my profile is this one this one is

00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:14,469
not about this one thank you
