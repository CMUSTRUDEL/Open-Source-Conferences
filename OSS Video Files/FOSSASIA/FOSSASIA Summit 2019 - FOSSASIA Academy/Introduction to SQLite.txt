Title: Introduction to SQLite
Publication date: 2019-04-01
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - FOSSASIA Academy
Description: 
	16 March 2019 19:00, Training Room 2-2

Participants will learn about relational databases through SQLite, a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine which is the most widely deployed database in the world. Both single and multi-table (with normalization) scenarios will be covered. Participants will connect to SQLite using the Python sqlite3 standard library module to perform common operations.

okay so welcome everyone to introduction

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,540
to SQL light

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,750
I am Chung Chien so we will just get

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,300
started in this since it's seven so I'm

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,120
actually a jc2 student from diamond high

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,119
and I think h2 computing yeah

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,470
the last bit at the bottom is is

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,840
supposedly for some students we are

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,340
expecting more students so that's a

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,500
different different event they were

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,660
organizing also so we're supposed to do

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,119
some outreach but well we'll skip that

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,450
so anyway we'll give you some background

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,760
info all what XQ like is a scale like

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,969
tree is actually stands for SQL light

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,680
version tree it's what we call it's what

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:50,149
we call a relational database management

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:52,890
system and its power base so any okay so

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,480
okay so we start off with four piece

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,610
cost relational database management

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,030
system it's something more do it theory

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,590
right the reason s Kerala is for base

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,140
rate is that typically when you imagine

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,299
a database you imagine this big like

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,220
Google server with all sorts of like big

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,950
machines and all blinking light flashing

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,020
stuff when in reality SQL light does not

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,540
require this you can actually run

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,979
everything from a USB thumb drive it's a

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,350
folder they can just copy and paste it

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,189
contains both the structure for your

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,049
database as well as the data storing it

00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:29,460
okay so I move on to Gary this is a work

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,060
accomplished no database management

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:37,740
system so is everyone familiar with what

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,970
a couple all these are is Laura Ling

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,180
okay so imagine you have items on items

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,390
on earth like items in a row array so

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:53,220
you have like this smoker is bottled

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:56,909
water and this paperclip right so in

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,299
such a row each of these items represent

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,219
a unit of data what this data is may be

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,630
very different it can be a simple serial

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,090
number it could be a

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,649
text it could be a picture it could be

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,810
an audio phone that's not really

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,819
relevant but the way it works is that

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,640
you will give each of these and index

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,519
number so this is the item 1 this is

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,550
item 2 is I don't tree but the unique

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,380
thing about Python is there in an array

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,470
the index number actually starts from 0

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,150
so it well this is item number 1 right

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,750
in Python this would be item with the

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:35,489
index 0 is item with the index 1 is item

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,110
either index - okay so how a relational

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,060
database management system is that

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,799
imagine a lot of these rules right

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,200
stacked on top of each other so one row

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,220
by a row like a burger so you realize

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,120
that hey

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,400
as you look vertically down the row rate

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,870
each column will actually be similar

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,430
like the characteristics will be similar

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,140
so when you look like that right now is

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,019
column all of these are bottles of water

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,060
like they may be they may be different

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,239
bottles of lady many different bottles

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:09,150
but they are all bottles right so that's

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:12,420
what we call an attribute so yeah okay

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,180
explore how this works in a wall it's

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,519
like you know like Excel she buys like

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,959
Google sheets that excel sheet but it's

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,480
like computers but you can use in

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:27,870
computing your coding and it's cool

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:29,579
cause computing is cool ok yeah ok ok if

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,620
you if you start visualizing your data

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,450
like how you would in an excel sheet you

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,010
actually help you a lot for this and

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,299
actually be using an excel sheet to

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,280
visualize a little later

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:43,260
so onto what SQLite data types of SQL so

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,959
the first day attack is called null

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,829
which is equivalent to the non invited

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,840
are you're both familiar with Python ok

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,910
yeah so like you know none in Python

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,859
yeah now is basically it just defines it

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,660
as completely nothing then that's

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,810
integer which is a whole number similar

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,400
to Python real which is equivalent or

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,560
float in Python which is just a number

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,079
with a decimal point and digits behind

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,290
it Thanks it's just a string so any

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,989
alpha by alpha numerical and block which

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,169
is what I'm called data store as is so

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,889
imagine you have a picture a picture is

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,750
a

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,659
it contains a series of like 0s and 1

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,310
trade so a block basically starts this 0

00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:26,189
and 1 in the exact same sequence without

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,620
doing anything to it so even okay so

00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,810
even like your text messages right your

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,319
simple a is a clear combination of like

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,090
binary so like a string of 0 & 1 where I

00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,659
can tell you that hey this is supposed

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,639
to be a but when you saw it as a block

00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:44,930
right it would just store this 0 to 1

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,949
this string of 0 & 1 & display as such

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,520
then last but not least we come to

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,550
boolean's

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,169
so if okay so does anyone know how

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,000
boolean were like true and false

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:58,259
inviting true/false right yeah so

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,020
similar this is boolean it's basically

00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,849
the true/false data type in SQL like a

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,939
boolean that's not the boolean data type

00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:07,830
does not actually exist because well it

00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,210
just doesn't exist however we can

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,229
actually have a walk around this by

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,779
using by using 0 & 1 to stand for false

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,360
and true so like you are stole something

00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,759
and so forth to just store 0 and when

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,800
you read it out you 0 equals to false

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:28,529
yeah and okay we'll move on to keys so a

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,509
key is a key a few in your table so

00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,569
imagine your Google like good excel

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:37,319
sheet write any column any like any cell

00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:39,060
in there is a key and when we are

00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,610
talking about zip permit here is that a

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,669
permit key is basically and okay you'll

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,009
be looking at table right permit key is

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,259
a key that will be unit your only appear

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,939
once in the entire table so that's how

00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,319
you know you can reference each row

00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:58,500
particularly so imagine a 10 10 entries

00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:01,169
right let's say these are all entries of

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,960
a guy named John right ok so if you want

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,180
to identify a particular aspect about

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,250
genre you need to reference it by which

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,469
particular rule so it would be good to

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,810
give every row index number so that you

00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,500
can write say that hey I want row 10 of

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,509
data like the data in row 10 okay a

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,310
composite key is what happens when our

00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,740
primary keys at least into multiple

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,360
attributes so like two different two

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,159
different columns will make up your

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,039
primary key the reason for this is that

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:30,180
sometimes you may not be a sometimes

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,750
you're sometimes

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,270
data maybe maybe what they called

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:40,199
something your data in your table may

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,880
not be so clear cut that uh okay that

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,150
you may be referencing stuff from other

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,199
pieces to like like maybe something it's

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,460
not as clear-cut on me maybe is it's

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,500
something is reckless about something a

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,509
particular person D on a particular day

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,720
so in this case of promiscuity be like

00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,340
what data percent do and what the person

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,190
is like who the person is

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,289
let's don't worry we actually go into

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,479
this little a foreign key is basically

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,780
like you making you a excel sheet right

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,430
you have multiple sheets of Excel and a

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,500
foreign key is basically using 1 data

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,580
value from one table to reference to

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,169
another table typically you'll be using

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,270
a primary key in one table to reference

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:24,630
to another one but no that's not always

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,449
the case but okay so now we will be

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,580
moving on to live coding if I see on the

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,849
slide right you can just click on this

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,620
first to the last one is okay I'll back

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:37,199
up it also in case anything goes

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,120
horribly wrong with our database we can

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,190
get a brand new fresh copy from the

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,039
third link but just click this and click

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:47,280
this and you'll bring you to what we

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,699
call Microsoft also as well as a Google

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,860
sheet

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:54,860
hey welcome yeah we'll stop it yeah

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,899
so just give me a hits up when you are

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,689
there you'll be looking at something

00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:12,289
like this so repair your to sign into or

00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:14,839
slash maker comfort notebook the also it

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,279
should not ask you for credit card if

00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,719
you ask you for credit card you're on

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,379
the wrong page and just reach your hand

00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,379
it will come and help

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,560
the second link is something that looks

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,529
like this

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,979
so at bottom you realize that for four

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,409
sheets right the first sheet is the only

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,990
sheet in what we call bad data DB

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,430
because this is a database that is meant

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,820
to illustrate bags on those that we're

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:50,060
doing doing that coding so the data here

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,660
is actually just spread out in your mix

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:59,290
tree which is contained inside contains

00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:02,660
I store stored data we store in dB I

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:08,829
will just I'll just quickly revert

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,829
things to how it was before we started

00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:14,750
yeah because I had a session yesterday

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,720
night and we actually did some editing

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,540
to it it'll be straight loss Sheila yeah

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,190
when you're logged in just clone this to

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,440
your own folder and you have an exact

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,300
copy of all of this then you will want

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,300
to create a new notebook

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,160
yeah for the newcomers the slights are

00:09:40,950 --> 00:10:01,410
over a Wi-Fi password over there now the

00:09:44,160 --> 00:10:05,540
sites are there the three facilitators

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,540
can get ready to move around and helpful

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,200
just look out for stuff like syntax

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,200
error in the accounts table

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,530
who

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,530
all

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,700
okay so is everyone has everyone gotten

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:42,020
they are Microsoft author notebooks open

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,020
we just wait for the new communist

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,320
so it's everyone evil okay yeah for the

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,690
newcomers right when you're at a slice

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,820
right just go to slightly level we are

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,060
now a live coding so we starting at like

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,339
coding the first one is a zonal book

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,400
which is bits of Jupiter so it is an

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,900
online platform for you to run Python oh

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,970
yeah and the second one is a Google

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,350
sheet that will help us visualize what

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,350
is going on in our database

00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,579
yeah when you have opened your zone or

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,120
book you want to sign in you want to

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:07,740
clone this database and my ID close this

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,959
segment and go to yeah clone this stop

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,010
and create your own account - love you

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,010
yeah just let me know when you are done

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,139
[Music]

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:55,730
yeah the bus is l li Lifelong Learning

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,730
Institute for zero is 6:01

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,250
and only I don't see

00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,960
okay

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:27,449
so is everyone really

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,640
yeah just it's like yes a lesson

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,180
yeah the first in the second

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:07,220
yeah okay we can't use this or you want

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:12,160
to give it another name this is a blame

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,160
with a brand new notebook on Python 3.6

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,639
yep

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:27,720
you want to clone this over so you know

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,620
I take one from the entire folder

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:36,820
yeah

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:38,260
because the database is aka preview yeah

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,150
this session is mostly about learning

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,070
how to meet but I'll just briefly touch

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,279
on how to clear data based on stretch

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:53,650
writer stuff

00:14:44,279 --> 00:15:06,070
you want to sign in y'all can take a

00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:10,240
look okay so far okay so actually then

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:12,580
you can open you can open a 16-3 WS

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,370
which this was much a second much

00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,320
workshop and that will give you a brand

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,260
new notebook at the same time you want

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,260
to open this workshop code right

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:27,010
workshop code no because that's where

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,690
our answer sheet is so that's where we

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,690
will be basing our structure for all

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,640
three I just coded that beforehand so in

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,190
case anything goes horribly wrong that's

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,190
what we'll be referring to Murphy's Law

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,940
yeah

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,279
so is everyone okay if I start and I

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,300
would just okay I just assume that we

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,009
are ready to start okay so today right

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,029
our live coding segment we will go

00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:03,309
through author of six scenarios she

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,990
technically is a repeat of two three

00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,300
scenarios but we'll be tackling these

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,129
three scenarios in a different fashion

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,589
due to differences in our database that

00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:15,100
were using so in first degree of

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:18,309
database our bed data database contains

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,740
a single table like this so there's some

00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,749
issue with this like one is that it

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,699
limits how many items or single person

00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:27,189
can buy on a day so this is basically a

00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:29,259
database containing orders in a in a

00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:31,179
supermarket and you just realize that

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,759
you need extra items so you can actually

00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:36,369
have for more than four items like you

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,199
can buy more avoidance and a record the

00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:42,309
table is cannot record it so there's an

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,660
issue so we will just get started first

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,550
the first line of code you want to do

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,220
when you're running SQLite is that you

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,069
want to import the modules from SQL like

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,679
tree the reason for this is that Python

00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:56,199
actually a Titan is exploded it allows

00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,509
you to import code from the other people

00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:00,189
have used provider you install it in

00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:03,370
situ on an online service take a heavy

00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:04,659
cream store so you can just import the

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,049
module and we'll be using all these

00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:09,520
preview functions to do all SQLite then

00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,799
the next one you wanna do is you want to

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,449
create a connection to a database so in

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:18,089
deck in this case we assign the

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,089
connection to this available corn so

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,429
yeah because yeah you all need to be

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:38,789
exact spelling so capital B and capital

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:38,789
D zoom

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,830
better is it

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,830
I'm big enough okay

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,999
yeah so after you create a your

00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,980
connection right you want to create what

00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:05,169
I call cursor so cursor is the

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,730
equivalent of your mouse and it is the

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,159
thing that you carry out all your

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,019
comments so in making each of your

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,200
comments to your database like a double

00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:16,090
click or click on your mouse so you have

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,980
you want to assign it to this available

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,600
okay thank your variables can be

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,700
different name but typically we go by a

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,159
pig's name so that it's easier for also

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,549
use some people you see you or for curve

00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:31,740
like codes or soccer so I I personally I

00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:39,159
prefer to use C so C dou X

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:42,999
si.com dot closer function yeah like

00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:47,100
that and you run this so on here you

00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:47,100
just control enter in your undies

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,860
hold on it's not running

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,290
this guy they're gonna restart my comb

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,250
he's not running

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,440
okay it's not running which is an issue

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,140
because if you don't create a connection

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:49,710
to your database well you can't really

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:51,870
run your code okay we're just going with

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,000
scenario one but assuming it doesn't

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,160
work does everyone have that same right

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,680
has what we call a Python Python Python

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,050
idol installed on their computer right

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:09,380
go to do you have Python Idol on your

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:13,470
computers okay okay huh we can try that

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:18,150
cool or we try it young can we use cocoa

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:21,360
that lets you have SQL a what which one

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:26,310
which one collaboratory is google

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:29,640
service because it's not it's not

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,320
running the question running ship and

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,320
dhaba is a will run on it with a number

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,919
yeah

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,510
she should show that star Wiseman

00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:09,030
yeah okay okay it works it works

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:10,410
everyone good yeah yeah so yeah so like

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,020
if you run it there should be a number

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,000
Gila right so we have running one to

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,559
create our connection so now what we

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,140
want to do is that we'll be okay moving

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,210
on to scenario one right so you want to

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,760
see what this guy John has bought on day

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,790
one as well as how much he spent in

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,470
total on day one right so in your

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,809
database visualizer you can check her

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:35,070
and find like hey this guy John on day

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:37,980
one so I had see what he bought for

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,929
bananas and took you combos right so now

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:45,840
we want to query from the database to

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:48,510
see this like true code so first of all

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,150
we want okay so the way our query works

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,720
in pipe like Python slash SQLite is that

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:58,290
you'll ask the database for information

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,030
and return the information as a row and

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,220
this row actually you know what we call

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,770
topple so you'll know what a police raid

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,020
the bonuses array yeah so just come in a

00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,760
race or a kid unpack that so the first

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,700
one is that we just call it which is

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,890
call it data so yes see to execute so we

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:21,179
are using our code to execute a query

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:22,710
which is select okay in this case we are

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,600
trying to look for item one I can

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,300
contact you one unit one price one

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,570
I don't do I quantity to item unit price

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,160
3/8 - I don't recall the DC universe

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,190
feet since that's gonna take a very long

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:38,309
time to copy a to write so you just come

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,360
here and just copy this part right so

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,150
just copy copy the headers cost well I

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,660
don't really like

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,130
hi the haters is copying the haters

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:53,050
right so these are just a haters

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:55,660
different hitters and then after copying

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,370
the haters you want to tell the you want

00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,760
to tell your code where to find these

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,030
haters in so what table so from so like

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,710
this he rose from the table original

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:09,070
data exact spelling including the

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:16,600
underscore so from our regional or

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:20,440
widget or you know data okay so you know

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,480
you thought you'd not oh your code where

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,700
to get a data problem but you want to

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,290
specify in this case you want to specify

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:34,480
that you want John and on day one right

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:38,350
so you want to tell it where your where

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:48,160
your customer name so customer name

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:53,340
equals to John and cuz it's a two

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:58,110
conditions at once and they equals to 1

00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:03,250
now any you are end this with with

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:05,380
semicolon and then double quote to

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:11,320
indicate that this is the end of your

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:13,750
command yeah

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,150
okay so after this right you wanna

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,770
create a comma because you want to oh

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:22,060
yeah okay

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:24,190
yeah this'll work so we can K run this

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:28,540
and we will just print out our data to

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:30,550
see what we get to print out your you

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,230
print out the variable that contains

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,000
your query from your database right and

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,700
you realize that he shows you this very

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,710
real number and stuff and it doesn't

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,240
actually give you white one the reason

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:45,100
for that is like okay so basically

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,770
exactly why it does it like that you I

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,980
don't exactly know but the way to

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:54,220
convert this string of real thing into

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,680
what you want as a array array is to

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,720
have the same is to allocate is to

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,170
allocate whatever you have curry with

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,800
this thing called fetch one or space

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,800
bash all

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,359
so right now if we press if you have

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,700
done with many pleated detail using

00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,460
fetch one and we print our data it will

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,299
show us that you show this thing in a in

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,700
a topo where banana is your first item

00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,109
for for bananas the quantity in the unit

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,609
price it's not that one

00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:32,739
thank you camber to 8.5 in 909 reason

00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:37,629
being that the last Shiite a nun is

00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:39,100
empty is blank right okay now sometimes

00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:41,739
you will be looking for information

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,350
where you will return you more than one

00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:46,059
room right so imagine I don't put the

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,820
condition day one I just said John

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:50,889
okay John has only bought items on day

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,379
one you make am looking for Steven

00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:55,629
Steven bought the bought stock both on

00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:57,460
day one and day two right so if I don't

00:25:55,629 --> 00:26:01,899
specify what day you actually tell me to

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,210
roll so in this case right so in those

00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:05,529
cases you want to use patch oh and you

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,389
can pin your data to realize that is

00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,909
slightly different because in this case

00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:13,259
it will reason to you your data in and

00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:17,499
it will give you an array of a race

00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:21,100
right so if you so in this case right

00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:24,129
let's say we want to obtain the would

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:27,419
but none are a the data array if you

00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:32,169
want to you like okay so you spatch one

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,999
right if we use patch one the data with

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:37,869
the index 0 array will give you but not

00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:42,279
now right but if I use data fetch all

00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:45,489
right and my first one would be just

00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:47,259
this top or this away cause in a 2d

00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:50,320
array is a race over here so your first

00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:51,909
array is this sorry so if you want to do

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,710
this you're gonna get the simple data

00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:56,980
from this you want to specify that in

00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:00,279
this array I want position 0 so it's 2 0

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,080
next with mix but since we know that so

00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:05,379
for simplicity sake since we know that

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,249
we only get one data from this we just

00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:08,249
want to use fetch one

00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,290
Oh

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,420
yeah if you actually yeah okay

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,790
kennel

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,180
you guys find it

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:51,430
you know okay so we move on okay so now

00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:52,570
they know that okay okay so now that

00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,310
year this right

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,770
what I want to do is that we actually

00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,200
want to append we actually want to

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:03,520
create three columns one is your item

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,130
name so P name for product name book

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,780
heads product name equals to a blank

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:17,500
array your quantity is also a blank away

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:19,990
and your price is also a blank away so

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,090
in this case what you want to do is you

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,480
want one of four you want run a for loop

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:30,310
for that for the length of this right we

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:33,820
want for I in range zero length of your

00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:36,250
array which is length of data and in

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,490
intervals of three because you know that

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,380
is actually it's a K repeating three

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,800
columns like you have three items so you

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,870
are repeating it three times right so in

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:53,200
this you want to open your name a pen

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:59,680
data I write and then you want to append

00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:01,840
into quantity a pen data I plus one

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,060
because I then you plus one so this will

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,520
give you a quantity so for the last one

00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:12,520
you need price you want to append I plus

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:13,960
two it I plus two okay so the end of

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:21,520
this you can actually take a quick loop

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:24,930
edge and look how your how each of these

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,930
arrays look like at the end of it

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,509
[Music]

00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,290
okay so my falling so far

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,179
are you fine here

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,160
yeah

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:42,500
I've been

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,030
okay okay so the way fetch one works

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,860
right is that because you know that you

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,270
were only you know that mean in the

00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,520
particle case they are searching you

00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,530
only give you one room so you just use

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,110
fetch one but sometimes you will have

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:57,049
multiple instances like multiple rows

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,630
right so we fetch fetch always is that

00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:02,630
you will give each of these rules and

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,990
index so each of these array will be an

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,990
index

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,910
okay so fresh okay the difference

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,220
between fish okay I'll just reiterate

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,160
the difference between fish or and fetch

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,690
one right is that when you fish when you

00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,390
fetch one you're telling your you are

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,450
telling your coat that there only be one

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,850
rule then that without there's only one

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,430
rule where the data is correct

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,950
so in this case you can get out your

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,140
data over here your code can't you know

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:43,190
that hey I don't need to put this row

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,990
inside another array because there's no

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,580
need for that but if you have multiple

00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,010
rows right then you need to

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,190
differentiate between which row the data

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,190
is from

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,690
yeah okay then I will then we'll move on

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,200
okay so now that you have know they give

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,510
your data and she erased right you can

00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,980
then run through each array you can

00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,049
actually just run through each array

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,080
because we know that for the same index

00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:27,330
right the data is corresponding because

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,220
you know that for the first one for

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:34,789
banana you know the guy is what 40 and

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:41,700
the price of it is 0.2 so for I in range

00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:43,350
range and a P name right because you

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,760
just want run it for the number of times

00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:52,620
in this binary field P mean you want to

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:56,240
check first if whether or not your data

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,240
is none whether your

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:08,900
you okay alternatively you can use like

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:12,590
not Ebola but for simplicity yeah okay

00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,450
let's just do that so if you are if the

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,230
data in your premium is not equal to

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,180
none

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,190
you can then you will run your code but

00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:23,090
it is non-riders there's no point adding

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,680
it to what you're doing now right so if

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,130
your opinion is not equals to one

00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,380
first you want to trim it you you want

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:33,410
to print okay they say there's a

00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,190
specific there's it's just to make it

00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,020
look nice

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:40,700
despite just make it look nice so you

00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:42,350
can click copy this copy this over this

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,360
just so that when your item and your

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,000
name comes out you'll come out nice ESL

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,890
I don't name something and a quantity is

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,550
something you need pry something it's

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:55,190
just formatting so this one change it to

00:33:52,550 --> 00:34:03,670
P name and unit price we change it to

00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:03,670
price yeah okay and okay

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,340
before we start right since we in this

00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:11,340
scenario guy actually looking for how

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,379
much money this guy has spent so we want

00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,560
to get somewhere what before the for

00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:20,639
polo with the with a value 0 assuming

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,950
that yes here's what nothing yet so for

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,679
every item we know that your son will

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:30,980
equal to whatever is with y is already

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:37,250
spent plus your quantity quantity I

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:41,129
multiplied by your you your price right

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,369
so at the end of this you can just clean

00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:52,679
out yeah you can just print out all of

00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:56,669
this and we're not some to make it they

00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,320
just spin off your total span then this

00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:02,060
pin is just to make it just give you

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,060
give it a gap so you run it all

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,330
[Music]

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:32,990
here and complain for I in range PTIN

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,990
yeah

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,400
okay hold on

00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:49,910
Premium I p.m. if the premium I is not

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:51,890
equal to none then you will run because

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,480
you are looking each each index of

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,920
please name to see where else I I've

00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,800
missed out that so you'll just check

00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,800
whether the entire column exists or not

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:08,050
so so far I ran following any questions

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,050
you can just raise your hand enough

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:27,150
yeah

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:29,490
this I okay is which I this one okay

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,770
this one is that design is just tell you

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,740
to look inside your prenatal really what

00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:37,350
index to look at because if your index

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,570
is okay so we are running each of this

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,450
right we are running down this okay

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:45,560
previously we equip into our a cape into

00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,560
our P name ray

00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:50,010
so if we talk anyway and you know it

00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,050
looks like this right so basically in

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,790
this follow you are looking at each

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,950
index you're looking at your banana and

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,680
how many button asius bought and what

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,780
price the banana is to find a subtle but

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,510
if you come to here you come to your

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,060
index or a key index to and you raise

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,700
Nana you here none of times none or none

00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,710
hunt anything it doesn't work cause it's

00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,040
not it's not something you can multiply

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,590
none yeah right so you to avoid their

00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,080
index area right you want to tell you

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,250
that if this is this is an unnaturally

00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,670
there's nothing below because there's no

00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,650
idea

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:28,490
so yes keep that you will not process

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,490
that yeah okay

00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:37,539
so if everyone is fine with that we will

00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,539
move on

00:37:50,750 --> 00:38:02,090
okay so everyone's fine if it runs fine

00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:05,780
I'll move on to scenario - okay yeah so

00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:07,760
on scenario - this guy called Peter on

00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,109
desi this guy called Peter comes to

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,119
advise one another

00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:14,720
now we look at our data and we realize

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:18,260
the same issue Peter does not exist as a

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,109
person right and neither and nine yeah

00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,609
and neither does Day Tree Hotel so in

00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:24,980
this case it's a brand new record will

00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:29,060
be using I will be using the insert

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,220
function okay so just insert a new cell

00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:35,390
below for a new segment of code and we

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:37,550
all have okay so decide okay very easy

00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,000
we will just create and we will just

00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:43,640
create an array where our venues are

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,760
what we want to append into yes ARR

00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:55,940
equals two on TV so d3 item banana and

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,790
quantity goes to 1 1 so you want to you

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,530
want to execute this query right because

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,900
this is insert inquiry so you don't

00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,990
actually need to assign it to a variable

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:09,890
so you can just see the execute insert

00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:13,060
into which people because there's only

00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,060
one table so always you know data

00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,290
original data you want to specify what

00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:23,570
columns to import it into so in this

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:26,119
case is a day oh yeah and you want to

00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:31,280
add a price at a unit price which is

00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:37,400
point 2 because banana is fine to send

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:43,820
to a your day your day going to add your

00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:47,260
item 1 your quantity 131 and your you

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:51,070
need right

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:54,510
one right this and what values do you

00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,510
want to add you want to add values

00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:08,759
I was for values of four pajamas in pink

00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:11,130
semicolon limiting semicolon to denote

00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:13,890
the egg end of your query and then you

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:17,339
book comma then you tell the late

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,690
article what a way to look at so that

00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:24,269
you can yeah

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:26,249
so you just a ringing name just at the

00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:28,739
end of this you want to follow what you

00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:34,079
want to ensure that your data is copies

00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:38,459
recorded so you so you do commit and you

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:42,359
just hold on yeah and you just drag no

00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:44,999
run yourself so now this has not shown

00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,859
any errors so one way to see whether yes

00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:50,309
actually work is to just download your

00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:53,839
database right just open it and take a

00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:59,209
look in your database you realize that

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,209
yeah people has been added

00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:37,130
oh yeah hold on we actually want to we

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:40,050
actually want to was a call we want to

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,750
add the people you want to add Peters

00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:44,609
name so we forgot we forgot to record

00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,589
that is Peter who bought this so you

00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:48,060
want to add Peter to an array and then

00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:50,790
you want to add him in the right

00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:54,900
sequence right the start customer

00:41:50,790 --> 00:42:02,180
customer name and then yeah is one more

00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:02,180
time oh yeah

00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,940
right so you realize that this is all

00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,640
theaters entry and Peter bought one one

00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,950
banana and they daydream

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,710
yeah so a simple this is like a very

00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,660
simple just insert it's typically your

00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,580
poets are like that now it says

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,410
sometimes you to manually or de Darwin

00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,900
so somebody to man you play or they tie

00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:41,120
when you enter but the egg of inserting

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:41,120
ends like yeah sure okay about which fun

00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:49,140
okay okay if you want to look at if you

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,150
are computable cool this is a key to

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,530
complete cool so now watch how cool this

00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,020
is a complete code so you can just take

00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:59,220
a look at what we have recorder and see

00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,840
how the logic works okay so now that

00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,960
we've done this right we want to move on

00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:08,820
to scenario tree right so Anna here

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,660
scenario tree you run like okay so back

00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,030
in day one

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,680
Steve has a case forgot to buy to pay

00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,660
for this cucumber there's a cue ball

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,940
right and now he returns the story

00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,330
peacefully so the database needs to be

00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:24,630
updated to record this I say we run into

00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:27,030
an issue because there is no item phone

00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,370
you cannot no database does not allow

00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:32,430
our customer to buy a fourth item on the

00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:35,820
same day which is stupid to say that is

00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,870
La Vie so that's the limitation so

00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,500
that's what we are going to do in the

00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:43,080
second segment which is to Waco which is

00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,670
to a click create a database where your

00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,550
tables are separated so you can achieve

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,230
a lot more flexibility this is a table

00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,300
called normalization which some of you

00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,860
might have heard before the main goal of

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,810
normalization is a key to reduce the

00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,580
Italian intimacy which is having the

00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:58,950
same little occur in the same place

00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:02,190
because in case your entry of data is

00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:04,860
wrong right the more times you enter a

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,940
simulator the more likely you have a

00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:11,460
human error in recording at some point

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,410
so we have a human error sometimes

00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,290
updates might not be complete so imagine

00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:19,200
you misspell one guy's name in one of

00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,360
the exchanges then you go and do so many

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,850
places that you say

00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,320
we start containing the guy's name then

00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:26,510
you actually have one beta somewhere

00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,160
that you forgot to D because it no

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,330
longer has the exact same spelling

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,780
even though technically it belongs to

00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:34,940
him right so now I actually realized one

00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:38,540
thing so I would actually need you guys

00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:41,840
to delete this database right you just

00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,550
want to delete this database go to this

00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,680
this drive right you guys should have

00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:48,680
access to it and just quickly download

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,250
stop just download your store database

00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,980
da DB because I realized that a ten-year

00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:58,190
study we actually had some sessions with

00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:02,500
this so the database in don't know in

00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:06,280
their notebook is actually not obviously

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,280
no team

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,970
okay so after you download it right you

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,060
just upload upload a singlet Abhi's so

00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:45,010
this is a good thing about Escala is

00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,400
there in the sensor a backup function is

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,440
very very easy you just copy it from

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,349
somewhere and then you just paste it

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:58,080
back in there and you're done just

00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,080
upload and our database is bringing okay

00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:04,840
okay so now that we are using a new

00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,270
database for part two race simply you

00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,820
want to create you want to replace your

00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:14,830
connection with a new connection and a

00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:17,770
new cursor so evening you know you write

00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:21,790
a connection equals two SQL like three

00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:28,170
dot connect to our new database which is

00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:32,130
Alco store database DB right sitting

00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,130
create a connection

00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,119
and just run yeah

00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,450
yeah

00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,170
so is everyone fine

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,589
okay No

00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,500
so if okay so we just move on

00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,970
not a very tall connection we want to

00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:17,200
then that go our knees ah

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:24,630
oh we're just making sure that

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:24,630
everything yeah

00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:48,910
yeah we China oh okay that means likely

00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,910
you have known

00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,930
one day

00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,369
I'm not sure

00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,940
I don't know I just feel myself

00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,730
 all these you know date card

00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:45,799
you will just run this one more time

00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:45,799
okay this is your phones

00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:54,840
okay we're just okay

00:48:52,140 --> 00:49:01,740
well we just we just delete all the

00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:04,290
Toby's yeah we all did yeah we'll just

00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:08,420
have we just use the backup to put in a

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:08,420
brand new database from the start

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,990
so and our

00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,730
so I know here this is our cover

00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,770
so this is actually one good point about

00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,840
escalator it's very easy to keep up this

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:31,030
just have it stop someone just copy and

00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:32,410
paste and it's already run that data and

00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:35,730
in the same time if you wanted to

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,730
replace our solemn late hours

00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:47,890
okay so over here you guys want to

00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,890
upload

00:49:52,109 --> 00:50:02,369
and this PC and downloads so yeah that

00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:05,910
Deepa when to open this yeah so it's

00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:08,910
here and stall this time we want to deal

00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:10,019
with you because this one was a key from

00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,440
yesterday session

00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:20,660
so actually all the changes having me so

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:42,569
same thing up the stolen data yeah okay

00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:45,539
yes the connection yeah its key

00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:50,549
sensitive yeah but I believe you guys

00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:53,479
deep type it I believe you guys did a

00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,479
bit correctly

00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,120
yeah

00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,440
like that

00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,700
No

00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,700
Oh

00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,030
yes

00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:06,010
oh okay single single coin double

00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,840
crochet work the same way but typically

00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:09,340
it's just a different shape so in case

00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,690
you have a double coin inside you need

00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,090
to have the core game right then you

00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:16,330
using look or else you a cube recover

00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:20,020
cost the way the pattern kill us you'll

00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:22,390
see what's in between two to two coats

00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:24,520
of the same one Savior - if you have two

00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,840
sets of double coincide why was in

00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,140
between that needle say what should be

00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,140
the common

00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:35,080
I'm not exactly sure why but let's just

00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:48,780
we can just complete we just we just

00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:48,780
copy this from the backup one and yeah

00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:59,400
sorry everyone else fine you guys are

00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,400
all fine right

00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:17,180
so this time is scenario for a we want

00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:19,369
to do the same thing as what we did in

00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,170
you know one by using a new database so

00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:23,779
new database is a case three different

00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,329
tables right three different tables and

00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:27,859
each time is recorded more clearly so if

00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:30,740
you want to change the customer name

00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:33,470
just here I approach your product knee

00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:36,470
is just here your detail name and price

00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,839
and if you want to change your and what

00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,910
day is the spot so each individual item

00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:43,190
how many time is born its total as a

00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:45,049
simply separate rule so you won't run

00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:48,170
out you won't encounter a problem when

00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:50,480
you buy more than the number of stop

00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:55,190
that your database has a lot of you to

00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,380
learn so okay in this case we want to

00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,999
use functions to write output because

00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,920
actually when you're close like that

00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:03,200
it's actually very simple for your

00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,420
person so for for whoever is using the

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,079
code to modifying yeah like have a

00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:10,999
different chlorine so in this case we

00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,660
just our function design is to do a view

00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:16,400
purchase rate so here's use new purchase

00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,009
and you won't know what the customer

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:23,230
name is customer name is and what day

00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:27,170
the person is bought it on thank you

00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,640
what they and what right so we realize

00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,259
that in this time when you want to look

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,210
at your records right it's not so

00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:33,950
straightforward to use your customer

00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,200
name because in this time is customer ID

00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:38,390
so you must first obtain his customer ID

00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,880
which comes from your your table

00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:42,559
customer detail so I select his name

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,920
where it was like the idea where the

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:51,079
name is equal to what our input name is

00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:57,609
so mmm customer ID is equivalent is

00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,609
equal to zero execute select

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:16,930
select I select from your table which is

00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:20,290
a customer video where your is equals to

00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:20,290
this case

00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,910
so in this case you want to create an

00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:32,530
empty taco oh yeah you want to create

00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:37,080
hold on you want to create a completely

00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:40,450
empty taco of just your customer knee

00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:43,060
just like that customer just a couple

00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:44,770
range one cause you have one question

00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:48,370
about here so you just want a couple

00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:49,810
like me one one then same thing since

00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:52,150
you know that there will only be one

00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:54,310
since you know they'd only be what I did

00:55:52,150 --> 00:56:00,390
for the one wing so you can do the same

00:55:54,310 --> 00:56:00,390
thing customer ID equals two customer ID

00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:07,510
don't fetch one it starfish all right

00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:10,320
and to make it okay so to make it to

00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,320
make it look nice

00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,330
right

00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,609
so to see okay hold on

00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:35,750
it's just made me stop customer him so

00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:37,340
there's my bed yeah so you realize now

00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,710
it gives you a couple of ways of

00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,570
language where your idea is to great so

00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,120
I make it like you wanna make this like

00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:46,790
loop battle easier for your code to use

00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:50,900
just just right I just customer assign

00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:55,120
it to the index 1 index 0 so it just

00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:58,820
return you this very nice ticket right

00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,950
so next you want to look into you want

00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,750
to look into your other detail you want

00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:07,040
to look at your other record table of

00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:13,490
four columns where your ID so it columns

00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:16,130
we are yeah handle for Collins ways is

00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:19,040
to and it's also day one

00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,950
right so you realize there are two over

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,370
here so you will expect to see two

00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:31,580
things what little so you just wrecked

00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:33,680
hot equals to see though execute so you

00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:36,230
wanna select different things in this

00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,830
case you want to select your item ID and

00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:44,480
your quantity so this tool right sorry

00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:51,910
item ID and quantity from what a row

00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:55,640
from all the record where your customer

00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:57,770
ID equals to question mark and this

00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,430
question mark is sending em pitiful

00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:05,190
customer ID

00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:11,339
right so here you can pin your record

00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:13,289
and see what he has returned oh yeah

00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:16,490
okay so again caps lock it here so I

00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,490
shouldn't cap not get here

00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,160
I did these

00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:45,170
I'll just look at what exactly my

00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,170
database looks like

00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:01,309
I proved that I did say how item ID

00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:03,859
sorry for that ID right so same thing

00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:06,920
you can't just be a good thing and okay

00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:08,720
so now all right you know that okay so

00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,460
now you know that you actually have more

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,749
than one row that you get right so this

00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,749
time we're gonna use special all I

00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:22,849
recover fetch home yeah

00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:26,839
so this time you return to rules so Row

00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:30,559
1 is where Row one is where the guy has

00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:33,680
born item violent and sorted before

00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,249
item one being a banana

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:41,390
so for banana see miss simians before

00:59:36,249 --> 00:59:45,049
John for bananas right say Kevin ID five

00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:49,339
two and your ID five being cucumber so

00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:50,960
two two two cucumbers right right okay

00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:52,329
so what we're gonna do now is the same

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,579
thing as before we are going to make

00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:58,249
we're going to append this into two

00:59:55,579 --> 01:00:01,579
different rules so same thing we just

00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:05,359
copy from this get your point

01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:07,989
yeah there is get your quantity and your

01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,989
product name

01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:19,549
it's a nice job for that ID equals 100

01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:22,890
equals to 1.so same thing I enriched

01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:25,130
lengths of red color cause you can see

01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:32,270
how many rules they are so you just I

01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:37,410
reached I did and then a PID got a pen

01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:41,940
rec for I in order first position is

01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:46,619
your ID so I 0 same thing for record for

01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:50,039
quantity so quantity top and record I

01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:54,030
position 1 okay so now I can print out

01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:58,559
your PID and your quantity to take a

01:00:54,030 --> 01:01:07,319
look at how each side so from the d1 I

01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:09,480
be 104 I need two of the T right so now

01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:12,000
we want to get so now we want to get the

01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:16,490
same output as we did before right well

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,490
get this output where

01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,400
so you want to get this output where you

01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,380
know your name you know the content you

01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,630
know you need price right so therefore

01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,150
when you come back here you need to

01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:35,360
clean it correctly mean so we come back

01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:38,240
here you want to use this for the ID to

01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,280
obtain prod ID to obtain a name and the

01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,990
price okay so same thing again select

01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:47,690
your product name and your price from

01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:54,230
your for that info table so you know

01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:58,400
this P detail product details equals to

01:01:54,230 --> 01:02:03,110
seed or execute select select what

01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:07,910
select food out nimi your product name

01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:12,230
and your price from what they were from

01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:16,270
product meet you from product info from

01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:24,970
product info where your product ID is

01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:24,970
equals to equals 2 this is equal to this

01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:32,099
so why is it equals to its equals to

01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:44,249
yeah

01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:57,619
for a little is equal to

01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:06,140
so for here you want to fall for I in

01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:07,640
the range you want to do this for the

01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:13,030
number of times or number of products

01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:13,030
are so I'm in ranged length PID and PID

01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:21,500
so over here you wanna clear empty area

01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:24,200
for product name and people that for

01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,960
your price and the re for a price right

01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:29,060
so now so when every time you search for

01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:36,890
one provider you'll get two right so

01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:39,260
simply P detail equals to this but fetch

01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:41,980
water because in this case there only be

01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:46,310
one row for one ID so don't fetch one

01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:49,370
and every time you do list you want to

01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:56,330
you want to append into your P name P

01:03:49,370 --> 01:04:01,940
name append your P ID

01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:04,660
Row one position position 0 same thing

01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,660
goes for a price

01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:13,730
row I position one very nice

01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,749
yeah

01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:35,980
ah yeah so I left this alright you want

01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,980
it to be PID

01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,440
in danger object is not suitable ah

01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:15,100
what did my PID look like again it's

01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:23,710
been is in a long day so ah yes we don't

01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:33,690
we don't have to hey do we I fetch one

01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:33,690
so there's a K no need to iiiii a sorry

01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:51,070
okay also banana in one way so you want

01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:59,190
to for another 4j in range length of

01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:59,190
your PD do you want to do this too

01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:03,910
so instead of I UPG

01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:15,670
wait

01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,609
I

01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:45,369
watch TV deal P detail

01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:54,000
yeah taking a really long day you know

01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:54,000
starting a force deep

01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:07,010
so is everyone clear on this part right

01:07:02,809 --> 01:07:08,599
is everything so this part right you

01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:11,300
realize that is starting to seem similar

01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:13,609
to a part where we have three o'clock

01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:16,369
like a column and a really and like

01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:18,079
everything is perfectly so you can just

01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:19,430
take you can basically you are basically

01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,950
doing the same thing not the cochlea

01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,650
some right so you're some is equals to

01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:29,780
zero

01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:32,240
yes here some equals to zero equals to

01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,010
zero and you can just copy all of this

01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,780
you can just copy all of this because

01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:39,440
it's the same process running through

01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:41,809
your re and seeing what it is

01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,210
just remember to change your name to the

01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:48,260
current ones so in this case a premium

01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:51,050
is still key name this time we don't

01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:53,390
need we don't need if condition so

01:07:51,050 --> 01:08:00,559
that's good we have print P name your

01:07:53,390 --> 01:08:03,490
quantity and your price so same thing so

01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,490
here your screen

01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,890
because basically you've gotten a same

01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:20,960
for mail data before which is three

01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:22,970
arrays or containing what Lane you are

01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,510
something in what you have so you can

01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:29,750
just copy this in clue and just just get

01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:31,670
this so now you're successfully gotten

01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:33,980
the same thing as before buying a

01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:37,240
different format I'll just walk around

01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,240
now and see what

01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,660
nice I made a mistake but this scenario

01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,660
was supposed to be

01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:36,070
at least I won because two conditions

01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,700
which other

01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:51,570
okay it worked okay yeah knowing of

01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:54,510
living in PID I don't recall

01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:56,610
okay because this time my your records

01:09:54,510 --> 01:10:01,380
of it all right

01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:06,260
so you want it to look like yeah you

01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:12,890
want to know this time it's right all

01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:12,890
right because yeah yeah

01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:34,260
so this one I have gossip in top pik I

01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:36,420
actually print a painting by this point

01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:42,990
we just change it to pin him and you'll

01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:44,730
actually be fine yeah because okay

01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:46,650
before before they try so you'll be

01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,360
peaceful but before this I basically

01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:50,550
show you that we're accepting that this

01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:53,490
for me right which is similar to what we

01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:54,810
have done in this banger cool right and

01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:57,660
since we have the simple mate we can t

01:10:54,810 --> 01:11:00,630
just copy this entire bundle code down

01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:02,280
there and use the same email but instead

01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:04,920
this time it was to be going Nana right

01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:10,620
remember before we had another name so

01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:13,070
anything they can just copy this entire

01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:13,070
phone

01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:18,860
shall come down here we place your

01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,860
prints

01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:25,290
so this beautiful man yes just to me a

01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,290
meditation right

01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:40,090
you're this to is left out

01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:40,090
it's left all of your

01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:45,929
left out of your function so that's why

01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,929
we

01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:53,500
so on your site you have

01:11:57,909 --> 01:12:02,110
okay you are getting

01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:13,409
and you are here on schedule so I

01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:30,239
pepto

01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:30,239
people like a break-in

01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:43,420
and thinking this clean up y'all you're

01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:43,420
debugging prunes and

01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:54,430
yeah so you can remove this tree don't

01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:57,470
forget about to when you clean out your

01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:59,600
some so the last there's a last part at

01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:02,740
the front of a power is a total or most

01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:06,020
been right screw the right hand side

01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:08,150
even before so this part we have a print

01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:10,780
photo Spanish do I include this in your

01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,780
dysfunction

01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:38,940
you want this summary to be inside

01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:46,340
Addison yeah also almost finished

01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:46,340
different so you can just run again okay

01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:06,170
yeah

01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:28,270
yes okay so everybody else it's fine so

01:14:21,909 --> 01:14:31,710
I move on to the other scenario actually

01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:34,690
thank you could be the cold yeah yeah

01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:36,820
yeah don't worry doing I mean I saw the

01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:40,840
naming so the different cost I'm doing

01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:45,060
this life but the logic yeah okay so I

01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:45,060
move on to scenario five and six

01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:04,940
okay

01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:07,429
hmm so now that right now that we have

01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:09,860
finished senior file for I assume know

01:15:07,429 --> 01:15:12,170
his problem tree like not anymore

01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:14,929
if you approach the traitor hello I mean

01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:18,880
worse - he'll kill you okay then we will

01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:21,889
move on to scenario five and six okay

01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,480
1605 and six is basically okay so

01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:25,760
someone has followed the de pavo

01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,530
paper item they bought one day and he

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,719
returns to a store to repay for a

01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:31,489
nominee update database she never says

01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:33,710
is that a person comes to a story

01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:35,690
inviting number of items right so the

01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:36,739
issue with this is that basically what

01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:39,769
we are trying to do is we're trying to

01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:43,219
insult a brand new record to the

01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:50,179
database so in this case what you want

01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:52,010
to do is so insert when yourself okay a

01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:58,639
new function we want to call this

01:15:52,010 --> 01:16:01,880
function insert new order so you look

01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:05,420
back here and you realize that you want

01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:08,809
what the the name of the person the

01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:16,750
quantity and the name the new titles so

01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:16,750
they customer name quantity

01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:30,590
for that name okay so here right so the

01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:33,050
issue with this is that sometimes right

01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:34,940
a customer coming into your system and

01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:37,130
you will not have a you will be a new

01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:39,320
customer so new need so first you want

01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:41,600
to determine whether this person is new

01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,700
or not right so one way of doing this is

01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,490
to see whether he is searching his name

01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:48,500
actually appears at any point in that

01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:54,190
evil so we are looking at name you want

01:16:48,500 --> 01:17:00,550
to do a count equals to seed or execute

01:16:54,190 --> 01:17:07,490
you don't execute right select so count

01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:14,350
break it from where come from your from

01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:14,350
the table from the table customer detail

01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:24,160
where your name is equals to equals to

01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,160
question wrong

01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:32,880
yeah Unni

01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:41,230
all right

01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,690
so same thing you know that okay cuz

01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:47,650
count is basically and it's just one

01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:49,810
number where so how many how many times

01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:52,239
this person's the like columns that

01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:54,369
fulfill this come out so you can just do

01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:57,340
a count equals two count

01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:59,699
dog fetch one right you can just bring

01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,699
your home

01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:11,730
so to test this we will just run our new

01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:20,280
order the order so let's assume same

01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:24,590
thing la so on day three day tree say

01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:26,220
John right so John oh yeah so on day one

01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:31,470
john-boy

01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:33,510
they was he born b1 okay here's not

01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:38,250
bowler cucumber so let's let's make him

01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:41,430
by PI cucumbers okay

01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:44,280
they run this and what tell us that John

01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:46,890
ray has actually appear in your in your

01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:50,310
customer one time right which is

01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:54,410
correctly cause he exists so we cheat on

01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:54,410
it let's say Peter Peter does not exist

01:18:55,430 --> 01:19:02,280
so you see where that place is

01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:05,460
so it shows you that it does exist so we

01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:07,410
make our number right we make we make it

01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:11,010
a single number and then we just do a

01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:13,920
very simple if condition if the customer

01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:16,920
if if your count is equal to zero right

01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,960
then we will ask we never run a

01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:23,060
different query a different function to

01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:29,280
record a new customer so new customer

01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:32,370
like that okay yeah new customer and see

01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:34,710
me so this function has not been written

01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:39,540
yet so we will just create the

01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:42,620
functional okay new customer right where

01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,620
C name is just me

01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:50,929
okay so basically we just do execute

01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:58,040
insert into a database zero execute

01:19:50,929 --> 01:20:02,680
insert into customer detail

01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:02,680
values passion love

01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:09,090
okay

01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:16,179
yeah customer detail Christian mom

01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:18,669
anything single topo I did so instead

01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:23,650
this will insert its name into a

01:20:18,669 --> 01:20:27,699
database okay

01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:30,309
nice we want to see whether the item

01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:31,929
exists right so the similar is a similar

01:20:30,309 --> 01:20:34,530
process so you can copy code from above

01:20:31,929 --> 01:20:37,360
to modify so you have to select how from

01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:46,780
product information I pulled up info

01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:48,989
that info where what where your product

01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,989
name

01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:57,439
well product name equals to cleaning

01:20:54,159 --> 01:21:00,079
painting how it goes to what so same

01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:05,349
thing if the item does not exist so we

01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:08,749
just knew I knew right of P name meaning

01:21:05,349 --> 01:21:13,959
so same thing similar function so you

01:21:08,749 --> 01:21:13,959
can just yeah new item

01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:21,909
okay but here comes the issue when you

01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:24,039
look at your product info ray you

01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:26,050
realize at this price view and you don't

01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:28,719
know the price of this object this is a

01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:31,860
new item we can just do a one of us

01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:39,039
what's the input required so you can

01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:43,380
price equals to include just other user

01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:46,960
enter enter price of item right by day

01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:50,249

so here product info for that Neiman

01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,059
price

01:22:10,499 --> 01:22:16,710
and see here two columns to catch a

01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:19,249
mouse to catch a mouse this time he name

01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:19,249
and price

01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:31,160
okay everything's so far fine

01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,330
yeah

01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:43,239
okay

01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,239
so is everyone there fine

01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:57,389
seems like everyone's fine so we will

01:23:50,369 --> 01:23:58,889
move on like your usual usual I like

01:23:57,389 --> 01:24:02,599

so shall we move on okay let's move on

01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:34,060
to the new class section so after this

01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:37,480
