Google Colaboratory (or shortly Colab) is a free cloud platform to run Jupyter Notebooks. It is freely provided for research and educational purpose. A data scientist can create an analysis notebook where anyone on the internet can click and tinker with it. So, it is a very useful tool to promote open data and citizen data science. In this talk I will present the key features of Colab and demo some example notebooks.
