okay so I don't know how much was said

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,360
about this tool in the previous talk

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,530
because my time is not that good but uh

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,500
I'll say a bit about it it's a tool that

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,750
is developed by Google obviously not

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,550
entirely though not entirely it's an

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,710
open-source project comes from the

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,500
Jupiter notebook I don't know why it's

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,849
leaking but yeah so it's a really good

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,809
tool I would say it's not the great the

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,820
best tool for beginners but it can be

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,040
used for beginners and and it's a good

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,930
way to get into the into the field of

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,730
programming and progressing because

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,700
there's a lot of tutorials that are out

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,010
there using this tool this is based on a

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,940
tool called Jupiter notebook to be the

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,530
notebook it's similar to this but it's

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,899
the actual open source project that you

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,789
can actually run on your own computer or

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,260
you can run it on on different servers

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,180
right why are we using collab because

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,700
it's easier for us I'll give you the URL

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:11,760
you can just access we can start working

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,700
we don't need anybody to to do to get

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,259
anything installed or anything right so

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,299
we just access this and we start coding

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:23,939
I'm also going to do some introductions

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,509
into Python and then we will start

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,460
coding and see how how this works so

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:34,820
python it also an open source project so

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,610
of course this is over this is the white

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:43,170
dot org so it's also an open source

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,420
project so you if you get good at

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,280
programming you can actually collaborate

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,189
to Python you can download the actual

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,979
opens the code for from Python you can

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,899
add your improvements or you can help

00:01:52,979 --> 00:02:00,030
with any of the libraries that are out

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,799
there why why learn Python or there's

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,490
this many reasons for learning Python

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,520
it's a very good Python for things like

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,129
rapid prototyping so even though it's

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,239
not the most efficient way of doing

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,640
things

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,620
in the end it might not be the most

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,719
efficient language it is very efficient

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,000
when it comes to the time you spend

00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,430
working on it so it's very you want to

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,250
prototype something very quickly if you

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,549
want to come up test a solution see if

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,629
you can actually get something out of

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:35,489
your idea it's a good way to do it um

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:38,389
it's also very as I said it's very fast

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,129
for for for developing solutions so

00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,680
there's a lot of people using it there

00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:47,159
it can be used in a very wide range of

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,319
areas so there's this library some

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,500
Python for pretty much anything you can

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,000
do since web development so I don't know

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,980
if you guys heard about Django

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,769
that's for web development you can do AI

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,439
there's tons of AI that's done in Python

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:06,530
Carris is one of the main libraries that

00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,129
we actually teach when we teach in AI in

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,790
the academy

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:16,229
why chaos it's not as I said it's not

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,329
the best option maybe for developing an

00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,519
AI for a self-driving car but it's a

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,379
good way to get into the field and to

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,540
get an overview how to do it and you can

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:28,769
get pretty much good results that you

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,169
can use in certain environments more

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,849
things that you can do with Python ie

00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:37,680
you can do robots with Python you can do

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:41,669
they stop applications in Python you can

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,769
do lots of things I think you can if you

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,400
click around I I always encourage people

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,870
to go into the website it's very it's

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,879
very important that you actually learn

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,900
how to do things by yourself

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,349
so one of the key things that I always

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,909
encourage in our you know courses and

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:04,250
workshops is to check out the

00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:08,099
documentation so as we go through coding

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,129
together the documentation will play a

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,370
key part so every time we need something

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:18,030
we come here and we look for the

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,510
documentation we can figure out the the

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:25,770
answer why we do this because we're not

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,270
here all the time so okay I'm here today

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,729
moreover you can ask me a question feel

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,949
free to do it but after tomorrow maybe

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,050
we don't see each other again right so

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,629
the best thing that you can get out of

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,590
one of our workshops or one of our

00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:44,430
classes is to be self-sufficient so we

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:48,030
prepare everyone to know where to look

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,530
for information and how to find the

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,500
people that will answer your questions

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,270
right so one of the main things the

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,479
first main thing main place that you

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,449
have to use when using any project or

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,030
any any language is their documentation

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:07,169
because that's where they they try to

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:10,830
explain how things work right there's

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:13,620
also other sources you can go to google

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,900
try to google your questions you might

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,630
end up most of the time on something

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,960
called Stack Overflow so I don't know

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,419
some some of the programmers that know

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,740
that would probably end up there I end

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:28,139
up there pretty much all of the time

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,509
because I'm really bad with the syntax I

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,610
tend to forget that every now and then I

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,130
just know what I want to do but I forgot

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,120
how to do it so type it on Google end up

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,099
on Stack Overflow

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,560
it's a website for question answering

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:47,539
for programmers so especially you find

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,169
yourself there pretty much all the time

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:54,719
so that's that for the Python part it's

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,860
a community driven project as an open

00:05:54,719 --> 00:06:02,009
source project up until recently was

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,590
lead by this guy called Widow van Rossum

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:08,729
which was the founder of this language

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,550
and he stepped down recently and now

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:16,319
it's just driven by the rest of the

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:26,550
community now and yeah so let's get a

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:29,039
bead into the call up - alright so if

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,909
you have any problems any questions at

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,690
any time we have about ten minutes if

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm not wrong right

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,430
so on this ten minutes we're going to

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,770
try to mess around with how

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:48,800
works and then probably at four I'll go

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:51,990
in more detail on the Python language so

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,390
when you write Python basically we write

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,190
different instructions and then the

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,530
Python interpreter will execute those

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,080
instructions for us that is how it works

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,610
and what we're going to do where we can

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,280
do in call up is that we can do that

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,650
online and we can just write it using

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,660
our browser then this will run in some

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:15,120
server on the Google Data Center and

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,190
then we'll get a result that's how we're

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,610
going to write everything you so there's

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,930
different parts here the you use this

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,750
and you you probably had to open your

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,790
Google account because this basically

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,640
will save a file into your Google Drive

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:35,160
so this is a regular file like any other

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,410
dog file it will it will see it will be

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,420
a call up file which is an it's called a

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,280
notebook so you will find through your

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,370
learning process if you keep learning in

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,350
if you keep digging into python

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,990
solutions trying to learn more python

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,060
you will find a lot of notebooks so

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,560
these notebooks are very useful for

00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:01,170
learning because they have parts of code

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,900
and parts of explanations so this tool

00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:08,460
is widely used for tutorials you you

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,320
that's why we think it's very important

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,900
for you guys to learn how these

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,670
tutorials these notebooks work so you

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,860
can actually learn how to run other

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:22,620
people's tutorials there's a lot of them

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:24,900
out there here you can see this list of

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:31,530
files the most important part in the end

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:34,250
you can actually just close this and you

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:40,140
can just click on file and create a new

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:42,240
Python 3 notebook one thing that I

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,200
didn't mention and it's somehow

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,500
important in Python there's so it's an

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,780
open source and a projects basically it

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,380
evolves in time and it gets different

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,300
versions

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,740
there's two main versions there's

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,050
different versions in Python but there's

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,080
two main ones there's a Python two and a

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,450
Python three and something to take into

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,970
account is that they have big

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,160
differences between them so whatever is

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,870
written in Python 2 it's not usually

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,170
compatible with whatever is written in

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,580
Python 3 and and all that right so be

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,600
careful when you're looking especially

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,270
when you're looking into the

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,430
documentation if you're writing Python 3

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,080
which is my recommendation if you're

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,080
studying right now python 3 is the

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,110
latest so just go ahead with python 3

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,600
and try to not even look at Python 2 so

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,970
you should be on the safe side if you if

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,100
you if you call everything in Python 3

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,940
so we teach Python 3 because it's the

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:43,070
latest and this I would say there's no

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:46,950
there's no reason on on on actually

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:51,240
trying to trying to teach the old the

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:54,600
old one let me see if we get the call up

00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:00,680
oh I need to signing let me just open

00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,680
this in one of my tabs where's my tabs

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:18,610
[Music]

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:20,040
wife is getting low slow okay so the

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:26,860
first thing that we're going to learn if

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:33,580
I manage to load my call app tool I'll

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:35,770
create a new one you one here if you

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,370
guys have any questions at any point or

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:45,820
if you guys run into any problems feel

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:47,980
free to feel free to run to let your

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,290
hand and I'll be happy to answer any

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:58,510
questions right so the way we do the

00:10:52,290 --> 00:11:01,480
workshops is basically we we open one of

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:05,680
these tools we sit together and we write

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:09,820
code or together right so things to take

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,280
into account about the Nichola tool is

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,070
that we can do two things we can write

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,780
text you can see it up there I don't

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,890
know if it's too small for you but maybe

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,530
if you guys have it on your own computer

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,230
you can see we can write code and text

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,270
there's two types of writing that we can

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,230
do right so we have something called

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:32,170
cells right this is a sale so what we

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,750
have here is a cell there this this

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,800
little square with the play on the on

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,550
the on the left

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,340
that's a sale so if I go here and click

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,640
on text it will create another cell

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,820
right that is text so there's two types

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,030
of cells say cells for text set us for

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,100
code right so this one is for text the

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:59,650
previous one is for code I have two

00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:02,080
cells I can go back here and now I'm

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,830
editing the first cell which is code

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,440
right so here I can write code and here

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,950
I can write text on this one down here

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,300
right if you look at the the tools work

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,230
that you get there looks like a text

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,270
editor normal text editor right so this

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,339
is why these are popular

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,620
for tutorials because when you write

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,420
text you can write the explanation and

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,209
then when you write code you can write

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,320
the code right so that's why we we use

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:35,050
it very frequently in our workshops so

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,250
let's go ahead and I'm gonna remove this

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:44,130
one we can remove delete cell here for

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:47,770
example and I'm gonna just keep the the

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,740
the code cell here and I think we have

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:53,140
five minutes I'm gonna write the first

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,940
line of code and the first line of code

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,760
that everyone learns when we learn a

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,830
language is the hello world that is the

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,560
typical one that everyone learns right

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,740
so let's go ahead and print the hello

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:10,089
world so basically the way to print in

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:14,160
Python is that we do print Y pretty

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:19,089
straightforward open closed brackets and

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:23,410
then we pass a string here so we use

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:25,480
double quotes and between the quotes we

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:37,180
can put whatever we want so we're gonna

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:40,000
put hello world right so now if we wanna

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:46,440
run this code we just have to click on

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,560
the Run cell icon here and if we click

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,399
my mouse it's not very good if we click

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,779
there Google seems to be a business slow

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,420
we get the result right under right so

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,390
what Google is doing we say print hello

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,779
and hello world and we get hello world

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:11,730
right so everyone on the same page

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:17,800
everyone got the hello world yeah great

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:21,130
yay first line of code now let's do

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,850
another one more code we click again

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,920
right we can write more code in the next

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,529
cell so we can print something else

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,779
right so I can print

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,130
let's not print hello world just bring

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,610
something that you

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,610
wanna print

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:51,170
I'll print hello 4-h then I'll run it

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:54,709
click on the run and there you go we get

00:14:51,170 --> 00:15:06,649
the second one right so we run the code

00:14:54,709 --> 00:15:08,930
on our cell so we can also write more

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,029
than one line in one cell so we can have

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,490
let's let's put the two prints together

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:15,970
so we can have more than one line in the

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,970
same cell

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,880
right so here I'm putting two lines in

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,480
the same cell so when I execute this I'm

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,780
getting the result of both lines right

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:47,840
so you can group the code in sales as

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:54,740
much as you want right so that is how

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:56,480
cool app works now because we're running

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,700
out of time I'm going to show you how to

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,840
do a text and we're going to leave it

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,540
here if you want to get some more of

00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,470
these Python workshops we can see each

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,330
other after the after the break right

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,580
let me show you how to do the text it's

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,220
pretty straightforward

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:19,670
we can do text here and then we get a

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,640
text sale here right and then we can

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:26,290
just write whatever we want right so I'm

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,290
gonna go ahead and write something

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:44,800
so you can see it's just basic text

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:48,080
right so when you put it here you press

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,350
you can you can run it basically there's

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,420
a shortcut to run it that I use so if

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,540
you do shift enter it would run the

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,090
shell but if you click on some other it

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,300
will just keep the text there right you

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:07,040
can format the text you can make it nice

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,840
make it a title so this is the actual

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,260
view on the right you get the actual

00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,030
view of how it will look and this is the

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,410
markup language where you can just

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,810
obviate for now you just use the bar on

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,930
the top and it should be fine so this is

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,630
how it will look so if you if you see I

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:31,040
create I created a title so I click on

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,870
the on the title button so now if I

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:42,080
click somewhere else you see that my

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:46,520
text looks like a title right so I got

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,520
my text looking as a title and then I

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,520
can keep writing code here right so

00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:01,430
because it's already for 3:30 we're

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,360
gonna stop right here anyone has any

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:10,060
questions about the coding about the

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,100
coop feel free to ask me now or later

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,170
and then if you guys want to learn a bit

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,920
more I'll see you after the coffee break

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,960
I think is on XO 2 if I'm not wrong

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,630
what checks their schedule because I

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,930
might be alright thank you very much

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,930
yeah

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,680
we using this because not everyone has

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,480
Python installed in their computers so

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:46,130
it's much faster if we go into the

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:48,810
online tool and another reason is I

00:18:46,130 --> 00:19:01,620
usually because as I said there's a lot

00:18:48,810 --> 00:19:04,410
of tutorials that can in this form in

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,370
collab Google I think you can do it's

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,960
mainly Python but I think you can do I

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,150
don't know I don't know how I think it's

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,090
mainly Python I was saying collab it's

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:21,330
mainly bacon if you if you click on file

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:30,930
right let's see you can basically create

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:33,270
Python yeah so you you can I don't know

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,580
about the Jupiter notebook which is the

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,190
tool that is used by because I think I

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,950
know they they have they have some

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,050
efforts into into building some other

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,080
kernels for other languages but

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,850
initially it's Python yeah but there's

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,300
online tools that you can use for other

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,340
languages we choose this one because

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,920
it's actually pretty new we think it's

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,470
gonna have a long term life it's very

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,990
used especially in the fields like data

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,590
science and artificial intelligence and

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,170
for teaching and tutorials so yeah

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,480
that's the main reason we use this one

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,980
and to avoid problems with installations

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,930
and different configurations in

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,870
computers and all that yeah it's just

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,550
speed up everything yeah well for

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,110
learning it's a good thing right then

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,420
you can try to figure out how to install

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,010
it and all that which is different for

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,110
every person for every computer right

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,300
you might have Windows for I don't know

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,780
this depends all right

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,110
okay guys so enjoy your coffee and see

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,110
