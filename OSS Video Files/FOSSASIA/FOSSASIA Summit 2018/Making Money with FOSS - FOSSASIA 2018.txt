Are you worried about how you can pay bills if you spend your time developing free and open-source software (F/OSS)? Can it be done profitably?

Ways to make money from the creation of closed software are well understood and widespread most notably through:

For developers who would like to make money developing free and open-source software (F/OSS) - whether as employees or as entrepreneurs - it is tempting to try to start with one of these models and stretch it to fit however neither of these models is even remotely suitable for F/OSS because both start by denying fundamental freedoms to share modify or even access the software's source code. It is easy to forget that neither of these models was obvious at the dawn of computing they both had to be invented and they're not the only ways to do it. The good news is that developing F/OSS is not intrinsically incompatible with making a living people have been doing it for decades. The really great news is that dozens of ways of doing it have now been developed and widely used. This panel will explore several specific examples with panellists from quite different backgrounds.

it's fantastic Mario as photo jerker

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,850
founder and someone who has a

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,880
particularly interested in making this

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,849
work and Ming Wong who has a background

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,009
in amongst other things running an

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,719
accelerator for startups and the

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:22,050
particular importance that will become

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:25,859
clear later in the panel so before I go

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,689
anywhere with the panelists firstly some

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,960
background why this panel or how it came

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,640
about three years ago we had dr. video

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,170
Melek Krishna then Minister for

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,079
environment currently the Foreign

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,379
Affairs came to force Asia and spoke

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,620
about open source and open data and in

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,079
his marathon Q&A one of the questions he

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,809
asked was how many people in the room

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,449
would like to become millionaires out of

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,070
open source software and his kiss is not

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,300
a joke because he was really concerned

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,890
that a whole lot of people are gonna

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,600
spend years of their lives driving

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,190
creative endeavor into the stuff because

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,670
we love doing it because it's fun and

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,250
not derive profits but indeed to have

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,990
other people do so and so his concern

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,400
was you know how many of us are going to

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,979
be for the room I got to be able to

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,810
build businesses that will thrive on the

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,520
development of open source software or

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,560
at least substantial development of the

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,119
source software's a side effect also is

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,009
a initial government of course is an

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,040
interest in strengthening the economy

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,040
not merely looking after people in the

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,479
room so I'll come back to that question

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,000
in a moment cuz I'm gonna ask the people

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,210
in the room the same question the second

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,490
part of the genesis for the panel is the

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,689
foss asia organization itself which has

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,060
a little bit of the Cobblers children

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,430
Papa Foss age was involved in in

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,930
promoting open source and indeed in

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,920
teaching people program in the first

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,360
place

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,340
all of whom then promptly go and get

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,470
jobs from companies who pay much more

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,990
than force Asia can pay and we therefore

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,689
have difficulty funding some of our own

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,700
instructor work and so there's a

00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:58,229
question there around how to do that so

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,630
this is in fact a sort of consulting

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,530
session for for Foss Asia in addition to

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,509
being a panel for the conference before

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,829
I direct questions of the panelists I

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,760
will now ask questions of the audience

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,140
the first dr. Vivian's question how many

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,690
people in the room would like to become

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,160
millionaire

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:20,590
out of developing open source software

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,600
Oh God only about half okay well it's a

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,650
start

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,650
how many people in the room are already

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,930
that's an even smaller know that wasn't

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:38,500
quite the question this yeah let's stick

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,510
with US dollars are currently earning a

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,140
living I would suggest as a other

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,510
employee or the freelancer where much or

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,890
all of your work is developing open

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,600
source software ok so this almost a

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,450
third well perhaps a quarter that's so

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,210
that's actually quite healthy how many

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,530
or are there any who are in a more

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,820
entrepreneurial mode looking to build

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:06,970
businesses creating open source software

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,350
and a few of those wonderful one other

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,760
category who I'm afraid I won't serve

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,070
very well in this discussion other than

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,930
the sort of broad overview there's a few

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,200
over there how many in the room are in

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,900
large organizations trying to understand

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,040
how best to engage with or use or take

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,230
advantage of or developer pants or

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,360
software to sort of sustain those

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,340
businesses or to build those businesses

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,110
rather than sort of strike it on their

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,940
own okay a few more than I expected

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,940
okay he's entering the room for any

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,290
other reason and they would they were

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,980
all the cases I could think of that I

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,459
you know

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:47,230
okay penguins so I have prepared notes

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,950
because this is actually quite a large

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,950
complicated topic

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,840
two fundamental differences the the

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,370
description for the panel session in me

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,550
in the program and starts out with the

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,470
observation that free and open source

00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,430
software is different to close off we

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,569
had not just cause the license

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,150
certificate because the ways of

00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:17,690
benefiting different ultra seen great

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:19,370
examples of that in kubernetes the

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,510
question that that begs in my mind is

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,380
where's the money for open developers we

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,520
have a good sense of where these

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,570
foreclose developers you either sell

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,120
licenses or you you sell service running

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:36,800
your software on your own computers

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,169
where is it for open developers I think

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,729
about satsang with Chris researchers

00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:44,810
who's painting things that cause the

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,260
creation and strengthening of open

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,360
source software

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,130
sure absolutely so I've been at read out

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,979
for about thirteen years selling free

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,660
software and I would say you know one of

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:56,320
the sweet spots has certainly in

00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:03,550
regulated industries they tend to

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:06,979
certainly have a need for security for a

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,110
contact to get support and help so

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:10,669
traditional sort support subscriptions

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,979
have been very popular with regulated

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:16,190
industries they're a little bit less

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,140
risk-taking in terms of going on their

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:23,570
own as well so technically I'm saying

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:28,220
that's been sectors like telco public

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:30,470
government finance also healthcare and

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,000
any other regulated industry site I

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,160
think looking forward like the

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,979
transportation industry is certainly

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
another key industry as well as const

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:44,919
animus driving driving themselves yep

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:48,470
yep descend you have perhaps another

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,060
broader source of customers who are

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,139
paying for apples development and and

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,580
feel free to outline what you're doing

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,990
for the benefit the audience ever knows

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,130
who read it is I don't think about knows

00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,050
who patty sources yes so yeah I'm

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,120
actually a traditional early stage

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,229
investor who wants to make money out of

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,510
my investments and but I'm also

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:12,590
third-generation nikola tesla's and

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,650
guess I'm a little bit nuts so I we

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,870
looked at this company called

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,360
bountysource three four years ago I

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,849
think at that stage we had about 10,000

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,289
open-source developers registered which

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:29,210
doesn't mean that everybody is active

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:31,490
and basically we went to the market it

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,740
had actually existed for 10 years as a

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,460
community but we kind of gave it a

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,990
restart in 2013/14 and basically said

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,669
all the companies that you know would

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:46,340
like to pose their problem about you and

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,080
then you know would any of these 10,000

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,570
open-source developers claim it and

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,450
solve it and get paid and that's really

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:56,150
the business model of bountysource so

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,740
today there are 48 thousand registered I

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,289
would just say open-source developers

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,940
obviously everybody's like active you

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,500
can see all the stats at the bottom of

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,930
the page if you want to see how many are

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,430
active or not active per day a month how

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,690
many issues and bounties are out there

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,890
and we went out and yes we did find some

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,729
companies that were interested in that

00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:20,210
and mainly tech companies to start with

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:22,190
so our largest contributor and customer

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,159
is actually IBM which is a little bit

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,840
surprising that I would say and I think

00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:29,240
it has to do with people that there is a

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,800
very strong advocate within IBM who just

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,560
loves this and somehow managed to get

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,240
four of his departments to do this so

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,539
that's one model so that means that the

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,030
bounty is worth $10,000 you go you take

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:44,750
it claim it so the problem and you get

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:48,380
10% can you say sorry sorry the open

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:51,680
source developer gets 90% we get 10% yes

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,539
yes not yet aware vitally important yeah

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,860
the rock around I think I didn't think

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,840
to ask before the session are you able

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,890
to talk in dollar terms we have the sort

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,440
of volume of business on the micro is

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,510
that not yet public oh no it's all on

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,490
the side as well it's

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,990
can you can actually get to get the

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,540
number so decide actually I don't know

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,310
on top of my head how my cat is but you

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,960
know you see daily volume if you just

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,400
look at the side right now that you can

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,650
see that there are a couple thousand

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,970
dollars per day I mean you see you see

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,700
it all in real time so it's very

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,260
transparent so that's one way now the

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,730
other way that I think is actually more

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,410
interesting this is from the corporate

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,870
point of view right but the other ways

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,770
that is what we call solved which is the

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,510
Roman word for decent salary and so

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,400
that's the second product there and what

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,740
that means is you if you do have a

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,850
project it's worth more the kind of

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,770
three four five six

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,780
entropy Nursia so if you do have a

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,630
project and want somebody to share the

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,060
cost of your project you go to salt and

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,550
then I can put with my credit card a

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,430
monthly contribution of $1.00 five ten

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,530
fifteen which is a recurrent to take

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,330
away from my credit card and that

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,310
actually has worked really well you can

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,050
see how the salt project has gone up you

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,210
can see all the statistics there are

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,430
hundreds of micro projects there that

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,250
basically where you get contribution on

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,960
a monthly basis and then each of the

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,030
project donors explains what he's gonna

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,770
do with the money if it's a milestone or

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,870
or how does it work so you kind of

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,810
follow the project so that has worked I

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,190
don't want to say that it's a huge

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,780
unicorn but it's going in the right

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:27,260
direction we got some new owners

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:30,350
recently so I believe that this can

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,270
actually take off from this this is that

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,890
doesn't concern me my purpose for the

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,360
panel was just not putting real examples

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,410
in front of people to make a BLT so the

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,000
fact that it's fledgling is it's fine on

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,650
that model when you first describe is my

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,600
tool is a bit strange but I then

00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,250
realized that I do exactly that as a

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,740
member of hacker space here and as a

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,420
contributor to Wikipedia in both cases I

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,100
just have an automatic monthly payment

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,960
that supports those projects so it's

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,140
actually not that everybody will do it

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,300
but it's not an entirely unusual one to

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,630
know so I yeah I'm extremely impressed

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:08,140
with its modest hero main unit supports

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:12,670
I suspect on other places where obvious

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,050
and really quite acute needs open source

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,400
expertise to be applied to problems for

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,020
the hurting large businesses and small

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,970
businesses and everything in between

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,760
yeah you know I was thinking about this

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,290
and to me software is a means of

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,880
expression you've got this programming

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,920
language and then you write programs in

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,030
it which other people feel very strong

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,540
emotions about when they need to

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:34,840
maintain it um and so in that sense it's

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,670
kind of like creative writing it's the

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,400
sort of thing that gets sponsored on

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,220
patreon or on Etsy right only the

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,290
difference is the stuff that we make as

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,090
programmers is able to run not just

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,180
inside people's heads it's able to run

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:52,950
on software hardware sort of machines

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:56,050
that are sort of in the cloud and the

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,000
the interesting analogy there is people

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,720
pay for this kind of expression in all

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,090
kinds of different ways and authors and

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,470
journalists are asking exactly the same

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,460
questions about how do we get paid in

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,200
this brave new world um so for me I was

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,630
thinking back to a great work of

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,180
literature The Time Machine by HG Wells

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,340
which if you remember I click in the far

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,500
future there are two kinds of people

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,820
there the Eloi who live in the Sun and

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,170
there are the Morlocks who live

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,870
underground and they're sort of steam

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,610
tunnels and it's I think of the analogy

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,800
is that the the Eloi are the people who

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,930
use the apps in the App Store and they

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,670
pay for the apps and then the interface

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,860
is really interesting right because

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,450
underneath you've got the Morlocks who

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,710
are doing the engineering and the

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,390
Morlocks are now having to figure out

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,850
how to have their own little underground

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,630
markets in the form of a bounty source

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,750
and salt so that's a just an observation

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,810
um that the secret the serious issue

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,270
here is that if SSL doesn't get paid for

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,160
if GPG doesn't get paid for there are

00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,920
serious consequences both underground

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,700
and above in the real world then in fact

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,100
those are the ones that I was

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,130
particularly thinking of as acute

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,600
problems because uh but everyone depends

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,270
on a pistol that's right these are what

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,540
we might call public goods right and

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,210
yeah

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,890
governments are all saying you know why

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,510
should we be the ones to pay for it you

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,180
know we pay for roads we pay for

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,820
hospitals we pay for school

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:26,250
we don't pay for software okay pay for

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,800
police yeah so I you know the I go I

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,330
think is this is this is perhaps to to

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,990
your fundamental question there are a

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:40,980
number of sources and where there is I

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:42,300
feel compelling things people need the

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,550
list of approaches is enormous so this

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,980
is I don't I thought about it I don't

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,850
look into this justice in a 60 minute

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,590
panel Lemonade Stand is a project the

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,770
lady who researches this specifically

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,130
does she's listed on github the 20 major

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,350
ways people sort of make money on on

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,340
open source but I'm just gonna skip that

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,310
section because we could spend two hours

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:11,280
on that alone but the public goods

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:15,870
question is I suspect the the broader

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,060
area to deke and so is and I hope being

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,250
has of it's been deep understanding this

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,900
problem is other goods funding than

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,070
something that any of the other

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:31,470
panelists have considered should

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:32,990
microphone surgeon was it Chris my bit

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,330
here you have any reason to think about

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,400
public goods funding public how the

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,700
funding of other goods so but public

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:48,540
infrastructure security things about

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:51,060
client which are so had yeah yeah so

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,610
yeah so this idea has been around for

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,970
some time

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,850
remember the creative comments idea that

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:02,180
we have like have the goods that we have

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,279
that in Europe and so that for example

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,040
like for for television for radio and so

00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:10,370
on that everyone has to pay a certain

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,320
amount so this was a question like when

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,519
like the music came on an app store all

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,339
these things like this was a big

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,529
discussion at that time but like yeah

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,029
there are different models now and I

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:21,620
don't know like so the question with

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,490
these models is always who distributes

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,589
them yeah

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,680
what is the perfect way to distribute it

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:30,050
and then who controls it so I don't know

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,180
like the states there are so many states

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,310
and and I I don't think like the state

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,470
is it good it's a good distributor of

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,820
these kind of services yeah I mean how

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,550
do you measure you measure like

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,160
according to users okay well then we can

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,620
just stay with the current so I I don't

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,480
know like so they are two two ways to

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,329
approach this question of how to make

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,610
money with Foss one way is the current

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:56,209
system like how's the setup how can

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,550
actually how can Faust entrepreneurs

00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,829
succeed in the current system and the

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,380
second question is how can we adapt a

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:07,640
system to the needs of open source

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,700
because it's a good for the how do you

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,390
say good for the public benefit yeah

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,089
yeah you could say like that so so open

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,440
source people open source application

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,079
they often doing good they benefit

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,089
everyone okay so these are two different

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,100
questions and at the moment I think I

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,330
would rather focus on this question of

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,470
how can we succeed in this

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:33,089
in this environment because yeah we have

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:38,670
to talk on a different level maybe -

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:40,050
sure I I was thinking more the slightly

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,450
different angle on it so I was in Dubai

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,860
lost what it was at last Sunday they

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,380
work on Sundays which is great it gives

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,779
me an extra working day so so you know

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,670
they want to put what they are putting

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,940
the whole public administration on

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,910
blockchain and a little revision or 20

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,620
to 20 20 the Land Registry the tourist

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,170
or whatever and obviously it's not

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,430
exactly you know all our 40,000 open

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,230
source developers would actually have

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,240
exactly this necessity that they are

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,980
requesting but for me there was an

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,790
embryo of a very interesting kind of

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,769
public partnership without community to

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,510
see if we could have been from you know

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:18,810
if they could put in bits and pieces

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,910
like in bounties of that big projects

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,620
and offer that out do that that I

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,029
actually believe in and I see it in a

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,290
very pragmatic way that we you know

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,779
because they don't have you know they

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,730
don't have 48,000 hundred developers and

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,959
I mean they can take all the developers

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,000
to Dubai but they're never gonna solve

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,290
it so I was kind of asking them if they

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,600
could kind of put it in bits and pieces

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,700
and put it in counterparties the way we

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,170
work and the obviously it's a vision

00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,540
obvious it's gonna take ages but that's

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,209
where I believe there is an opportunity

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,399
in countries that are open up opening up

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,770
their public administration that way and

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,839
they see that it can't be done maybe

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,880
just be the big guys like IBM or

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,800
consensus or whatever so that is I think

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,020
opportunity we had a Singapore

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,720
government rep keynoting last year and

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,149
for SIA announcing such a program within

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,220
Singapore exactly that they are letting

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:07,290
out the contract in small pieces yeah

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,329
they don't need Jonin contractors

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,250
exactly because Singapore has

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,990
historically always been about

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,069
strengthening Singapore Inc and

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,220
therefore the two or three major at size

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,990
here now but at the recce it's now being

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,490
recognized that if there's a number of

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,720
problems that one that we care about

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,579
which is that open-source developers get

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,199
paid but but a bunch of other related

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,520
problems and so there's an active

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,290
initiative to do exactly what you just

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,540
to the point where it's possible to

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,550
slice out small business and then

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,130
contract amount to individual developers

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,890
so sure you met another point we know

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,960
about the the I cos that wall curd in

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,520
the last 12 months and the amount of

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,560
engineering talent that they're going to

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,330
need in order to deliver yes that's more

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,700
of a Robin Hood right so all these

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,660
companies to raise so much money so they

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,610
need to use it right so so so so they in

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,650
my view is that what I read what was it

00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,960
now age of contra map numbers I don't

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,060
quote mothers but I think he was 891

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,850
projects that raised about six billion

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,410
dollars last year and and one thing that

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,820
they don't have a clue about is actually

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,100
how they gonna execute those because

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,750
they they've all put some kind of white

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,940
papers but they don't have a clue really

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:17,530
what to do and I think that's another

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:20,080
opportunity to tap in into and III

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:25,270
really think that that could be you know

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,400
more than a decent Roman salary you know

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,290
more than salt because they actually do

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,430
have a money so that's maybe another

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,840
opportunity so okay so I like okay how

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,720
to make money with false of course you

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,100
can have a job somewhere I mean like and

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,360
you can have a job as an open source

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,430
developer everywhere today

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,690
so you don't need like a horse company

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:48,460
but where are the new big or the

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,890
companies that get big the new big fast

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,620
companies where are they and like so

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,270
they are fewer okay but like they're

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,730
mainly maybe from the West but which

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,380
other ones started in recent years like

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,000
when red head was started and we

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,770
followed it the first few years we

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,570
thought okay they're gonna be like a lot

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,000
of these kind of companies we see

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,100
companies like that are established

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,100
traditional companies switching more and

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,350
more to open source but like I don't see

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,990
so so many like companies that actually

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,910
become big and make an open source model

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,330
and especially my question is what about

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,350
Asia we are here in Asia like a lot of

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,200
these companies of course they have a

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,480
longer tradition in Europe and the US

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,070
with the open source but I think in

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,490
order to succeed with this also

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,679
different vision of how knowledge how

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:40,759
how everything is shared we need

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,559
more companies here in Asia who really

00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,840
like founded by open source and free

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,559
software contributors and and who follow

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,220
this model of sharing so how can we get

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,850
this done

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:56,990
apart from job opportunities and the

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,639
interesting thing that I see here is we

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,470
have a lot of open source project I

00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:02,990
think many of them have a commercial

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,169
opportunity but we know like that not

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,440
everyone has a drive to be a businessman

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:11,659
however maybe some have or some would

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,580
like to team up and and the fantastic

00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:16,850
thing is we already have technology yeah

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,919
there is maybe not a product that is

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,950
ready for the consumer market but like a

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,169
lot of open source applications they are

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,210
already very good yeah so it's not like

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:28,309
a traditional startup where you say okay

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,779
let's raise money we have this idea we

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,340
hire developers we do this in Ted I

00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,379
really know how to make a pitch and a

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,990
business plan and my father has some

00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:39,830
friends but like it's really like here

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,210
we have often technology and so we just

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,470
need the business on top and not like

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:49,369
the business and the technology

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:52,119
developed this is so this is the next it

00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:56,929
means that if my my sequence is logical

00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:59,409
so yes the the fact that the force Asia

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:02,139
accelerator was announced yesterday is

00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:04,129
right on the point over now what a hit

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:05,450
the difference and this is a bit like

00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,149
the entrepreneur first model that I

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,940
think men could describe to us where

00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:12,110
many and so it is a a business grad with

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,110
a power point tech looking for a code

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:17,299
monkey we're now in the others we're

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,450
having the other problem which is we've

00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:23,269
got sold engineering and a very large

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,879
body of existing code and it's the

00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:27,470
question is okay how do we locate a

00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:30,230
market and mend service customers and

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:34,129
end and build businesses on this and on

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,519
top of that and this is I think the the

00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:39,740
question for fossa is their scope to

00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,200
build an institutional structure called

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,850
an accelerator but the details will be

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,980
specific to foster that

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,120
activity and can't force I should do it

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,780
too it's the the second half of the

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,000
question to encourage and train and

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,130
support developers who have an

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,570
entrepreneurial bent who have a strong

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,410
commitment to open source and who want

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,850
to build businesses around developing

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,110
and strengthening ideally existing open

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,770
source software rather than creating yet

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,360
another thousand half-baked ideas and if

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,520
so what might such an institution look

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,610
like that's really a question I'd first

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,960
put in Ming's direction given your

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,770
direct experience in writing excellent

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:26,150
right so just to give some background I

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:27,980
from 2012 onwards I was involved in an

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,470
accelerator incubator called JFDI

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,130
and we made about 70 investments in

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:36,320
startups over the course of three years

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,450
and we learned some interesting lessons

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,590
about that which was that it's not easy

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,280
to be Y Combinator in fact Y Combinator

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,740
itself

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,420
I had trouble being Y Combinator they

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,180
actually started out in Cambridge

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,820
Massachusetts home of MIT and Harvard

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,410
and they were doing very well until they

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,150
moved to Silicon Valley so so the lesson

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,530
there is I don't know maybe we need to

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,780
move Silicon Valley but it's not the

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,040
answer we want to hear and like VCS

00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,660
moving out of Silicon Valley at the

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,420
moment right so that's that's another

00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:12,200
pendulum shift so just the background

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:16,430
there is that we recruited teams a

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,560
hacker hustler and the hipster to build

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,150
small companies that would hopefully get

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,050
big and we succeeded in doing that

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:26,480
reasonably well and so I think there is

00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,520
an understood model in how to accelerate

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,920
small startups to the point of

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,810
break-even profitability Series A in

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,140
this country and in the region and just

00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,910
generally that knowledge is out there

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,970
it's a different question to say how do

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,830
we bring a non-profit to the same point

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,990
of sustainability because you don't get

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,630
a lot of social impact investing the way

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,430
you get a lot of vc investing and yet

00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,050
the world is turning towards social

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,560
impact and social issues and social good

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,870
so I see open-source software as a

00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,470
fantastic example

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:02,350
a high social impact public good now

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,570
traditionally this would be the domain

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,990
of government - fun right and you talked

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,640
about how fossa Asia has the problem of

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,530
educating young people who then go off

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,350
and get jobs and don't necessarily give

00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,720
back and that problem is very acutely

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,110
felt by any educational institution in

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,540
the world other than possibly Harvard

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,160
because every school faces that problem

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,780
and every school has pretty much solved

00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,430
that problem by saying we're going to

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,260
have a financial model where you do

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:33,010
student loans or governments will just

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,420
pay for it now in our world that doesn't

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,900
really happen right I don't see the

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,679
government funding open source education

00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,450
to some extent they do

00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,179
you've got GA and a lot of that is

00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,340
funded by the government to some extent

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,830
people can take loans to go out and get

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,150
an education I would argue that most of

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,580
the time you don't need to take a loan

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:55,240
you just need to have a web browser and

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:57,580
their willingness to use Stack Overflow

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,020
instead of Facebook that can be a

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,200
difficult thing for a lot of people but

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:05,440
this is also partly the sort of the two

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,720
different meanings will they lose weight

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,600
attached to education one is mastering

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,010
and skill set or might and/or like way

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,440
thinking and the other is getting rid of

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,300
paper right and to the sort of learn

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,530
driven limited supply of universities

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,820
paused about degrees planted by

00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,679
legislators yada-yada

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,250
he's about the signaling right it's not

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,240
about the expertise right and so the at

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,250
the open source community in particular

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,620
because a lot of us do this for the fun

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,559
of it has much more interest in there in

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,870
the format yeah so I think I know we're

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,010
talking about the where is the money in

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,220
open source but it might be interesting

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,690
to contrast our discussion with what

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,770
might be going on in a different room in

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,679
a different track where they're probably

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,970
talking about Bitcoin and blockchain

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,070
probably at this room in two hours

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,559
oh okay so in this room in two hours I

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,240
guarantee that people will use the term

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,820
medium of exchange and store a value

00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,860
right to talk about what is money but I

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:04,840
would like to play with that idea and

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:08,020
say maybe software is a medium of value

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,169
um that isn't money but it definitely

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,789
has the characteristics of people

00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,860
created people spend a lot of time

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,860
contributing value into helping other

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,690
people with it and all the interaction

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,059
that you get on websites like Stack

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,970
Overflow is unpaid but incredibly

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:27,909
valuable isn't it and it creates a

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,919
long-term store of useful information in

00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:33,340
the same way that books and papers and

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:37,779
journals do only our kind of information

00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:40,450
is its tangible and alive and useful in

00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:41,590
a way that an academic paper isn't even

00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,000
though that's the credential that

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,649
governments of the future you can't

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,720
execute an academic paper that's exactly

00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:50,799
right and so I would just to finish that

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:54,159
point I think you know humans we are not

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,990
the only animal to use tools try to

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,299
think of crows and chimpanzees and

00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,360
humans are not the only animal to use

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:04,240
language but we are the only animal to

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,179
use language as a tool and when we can

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,840
use language as a tool at scale running

00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:13,659
on hardware that makes us I think that

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:19,870
makes programmers the most evolved form

00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:23,890
of human being out there I love the

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:30,460
argument drifting boldly back towards

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:33,730
practicalities crits so supposing

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,950
hypothetically we sort of build an

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,990
incisional structure an accelerator that

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,010
is focusing on developing whether it's

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,919
startups or whether it's some other

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:47,380
structure organizations that operate and

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:51,970
thrive building supporting maintaining

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:54,340
open source software to what extent the

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,500
risk-averse industries and governments

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,630
going to be willing to talk to

00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,120
organizations at this scale rather than

00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:04,710
go to the stable established a very

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,659
broad shoulders away sure so the

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,399
regulated industries are a great

00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:11,200
customer base for RedHat but it may not

00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,690
be a a great customer base

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,399
or startups for sure they tend to be

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,070
more conservative they tend to buy from

00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,740
more established companies so I'm not

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:24,039
sure I would advise so much targeting

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,440
regulated industries they tend to when

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,080
I've seen other open-source companies

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,019
that are smaller we just purchased core

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,059
OS for instance and their customer base

00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:38,500
had some overlap but also they were

00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:40,149
targeting I would say smaller companies

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,210
as well that Red Hat may have not paid

00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:45,100
as much attention to okay said leashes

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,240
arise simply because of the economies of

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,710
attention you know

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,380
Red Hat is sort of compelled to focus on

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,620
a bigger more bit difficult to service

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,820
accounts and if I can't chase the it's

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,090
got to eat the deer account is the mice

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,429
yeah okay so this is you would estimate

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:03,159
any number of those small opportunities

00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:05,200
to allow smaller they just release get

00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,970
started yeah absolutely and then I also

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,549
see you know in terms of monetization

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,990
there's a traditional software direct

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:15,460
sell but we also see companies have

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,649
monetized open source and indirect

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,830
manner and then their payment back has

00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:22,630
been giving back open source so if you

00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:26,820
look at any the large Internet companies

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,350
Facebook Google etc they are actually

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,419
centers of innovation for open source as

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,730
you saw in the previous talk with

00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:38,380
different projects Cassandra kubernetes

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:40,840
etc Open Compute and they are certainly

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,070
if open source didn't exists they

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,659
probably wouldn't exist at the scale

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,720
that they did so early in their lifetime

00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:49,090
I just do the economies a scale and a

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,919
voltage source but they have been giving

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,690
back so they've been good citizens of

00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,570
open source and they've been able to

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,549
monetize open source as well a further

00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,659
piece and that actually camping the last

00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,510
presentation that hadn't occurred to me

00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,559
in preparing the panel if you are not in

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,080
the business of selling software

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,030
licenses it's a whole lot easier to

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,480
share yourself

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,520
it's got the red hats and the over maybe

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,570
Google but but but I'm thinking you know

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,000
no diamonds in the room in there are

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,950
others who has not software companies

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,590
and people take there are some things

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,200
that are either far too sensitive or

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,810
that are differentiating they spend a

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,190
great deal on at least intubating and

00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,920
occasionally in sort of not invented

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,230
here mode actually reinventing stuff

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,780
that exists in fact it's beneficial I

00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,180
would suggest for them to be using and

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,680
or sharing at all then you know joining

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,120
the pool for those things are not

00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,160
differentiating and where they're not so

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,140
a lot since it's also product yeah it's

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,120
a constant conversation I have

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,240
especially in Silicon Valley but not

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,800
vented here we see a lot of folks at

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,510
these the larger internet companies and

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,990
bending their own technology system for

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,910
the sake of doing that and sometimes I

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:01,390
scratch my head and and it's actually

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:03,270
evolved into a more serious challenge

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,680
because they have a hard time attracting

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:10,510
engineers that want to learn this

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,400
proprietary one-off technology when

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:16,600
they're changing jobs every to win to

00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,130
winning in the valley so it be it's

00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,950
becoming more and more difficult with a

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:24,700
low unemployment rate how do you attract

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,650
engineers today to work on your hundred

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,840
junk open-source technologies that they

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,440
can put on their resume and they can be

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,930
relevant to the next assignment and then

00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,440
also you know how do you quickly scale

00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,450
up your new engineers and have them be

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,160
productive quickly well if you're

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,410
leveraging open standard open source

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,330
technologies you know they can come off

00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,700
the street and be a lot more productive

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,920
lower your training costs and as a

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,750
result you're gonna have a much more

00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,260
efficient organization so we've

00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:58,030
definitely had many cases of customers

00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,109
who are very much about inventing their

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,190
own maybe middleware server there

00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:04,710
orchestration tear have definitely

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:07,169
changed that opinion as it's become more

00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,179
and more difficult to to scale out their

00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:10,859
engineering organization so that's a

00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,570
piece of will be heard yesterday from

00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:14,369
Daimler about in fact the number one

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,099
reason for engaging with open source was

00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,570
speed of innovation attracting engineers

00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:21,179
was number two and costs was number

00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,070
three we like to say no one's smarter

00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,399
than everyone that's really reflective

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:29,749
of open source right so I don't have a

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,889
list of other things sorry I don't know

00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:34,619
did quite on the side any other comments

00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:36,629
at this moment yeah maybe on the social

00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,009
impact thing that Ming mentioned and and

00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:39,629
the blockchain thing I I do actually

00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:43,499
believe that that's huge

00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:45,089
I was recently we in Istanbul we we

00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:49,169
called it to whatever the world business

00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:51,389
angel slash social impact foramen and I

00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,460
I really believe that that these user

00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:57,629
cases are strong so somewhere that

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:59,700
interface between social impact open

00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:02,369
source and blockages somewhere there I I

00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,889
really see some you know some money

00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:07,919
coming and maybe even stronger in the

00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:09,450
social impact piece actually also from a

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,269
regulatory point of view I think in all

00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:14,549
these blog chains I mean what what do we

00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:17,339
really want to do it's it's about

00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,159
inclusion Financial Inclusion and and

00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,109
that's huge and if we can get and that

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,629
is a social impact project in itself and

00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:26,369
it obviously you know there is it yes

00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:28,559
it's true that European and American

00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:32,190
investors are more eager to in invest

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,219
into social impact projects but here the

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,929
social impact project is so such a big

00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:38,179
opportunity this part of the world that

00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:41,129
becomes interesting for everyone

00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:42,260
including myself are dodging traditional

00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:45,460
social impact

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:48,410
I've participated as a mentor in the DVS

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,809
socialization prevents so yes they're

00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,640
not of the scale of American and

00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,080
European programs but it's it is

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,320
happening and intersting that's

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,970
happening not doing that exclusively in

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,850
government to make not even primarily I

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,990
think there are enough interests outside

00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,880
of government who want to see the

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,020
society around them functions then if

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,520
you add do you know the Middle East

00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,960
experience when you know they're all

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,669
kind of Islamic thing in terms of how

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,649
they invest because it's not true you

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:14,720
name trust returns but it has to have

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,460
that dimension there and again was

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,409
referring to some of the two discussions

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,720
to Dubai I had you know then you get

00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:22,310
another source of financing and you kind

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,139
of somehow make it and I'm just

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,450
brainstorming here Sharia compliant it

00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,540
and then it becomes very attractive so

00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,980
can I respond to that point so I'd like

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,290
to so base what you've said about social

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,610
impact and the opportunity for

00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:37,370
blockchain and open source that whole

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,510
nexus I'd like to propose you know this

00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,850
is off the top of my head to our

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,669
grandson I'd like to propose a dichotomy

00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,899
between financial impact and social

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,889
impact Ryan this is the double bottom

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,230
line intro the bottom line that we're

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,139
familiar with and it seems to me that if

00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,100
the goal is financial impact who wants

00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,620
to be a millionaire who wants to make a

00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,260
lot of money then you're associated with

00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,880
centralizing technologies because I take

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,260
Visa for example right visa goes and

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,650
takes three percent of every transaction

00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,420
but they are one organization right

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,940
Mastercard Amex but these things tend to

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,650
centralize social impact has different

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,380
goals and I would argue that they tend

00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:14,360
to decentralize right and because

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,800
ultimately if you want to create social

00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,410
impact you have to do it at scale and

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,700
you can't have you know the giant red

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,990
cross go out there and solve everybody's

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,700
problems the only way to solve

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,560
everybody's problems is to have

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,320
everybody working on it and so that's

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,370
man naturally decentralized and

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,410
decentralization relies on open

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,100
protocols open protocols rely on open

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,560
source software and open source software

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:40,880
can be connected to blockchain when you

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,530
look at things like IP FS and falcone I

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,040
think are really interesting examples of

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,320
how

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,640
you can tokenize and infrastructure

00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,130
decentralized open source open standard

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,200
protocol but also have money around it

00:35:52,130 --> 00:36:02,150
so I think that might open a different

00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:03,590
discussion I missed one step so that the

00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,200
project you were describing

00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:08,300
so ipfs the in your planetary file

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,180
system in some ways that wins the money

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,610
Shammi associated so the challenge here

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,280
is how do we have a internet scale

00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,140
database that is not hosted at AWS and

00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,110
so the answer is it has to be hosted in

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,630
everybody's home behind your little DSL

00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,640
router right now how do you incentivize

00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,440
people to provide that hosting service

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,020
and keep your hard drive turned on when

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,090
you're not at home and it's a little bit

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,500
like the BitTorrent question some people

00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,170
do it because they're just naturally

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,850
doing that but if you put a financial

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,980
incentive behind it you say for every

00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:43,040
file that belongs to somebody else

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,630
that I host I get paid a tiny chunk of

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,730
coin then you've got a financial

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,290
mechanism to encourage everybody to have

00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,790
a hard drive at home connected to the

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,730
Internet storing everybody else's data

00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,410
in a decentralized way which is not AWS

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,640
so you've got that protocol you've got a

00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,950
standard you've got the software and

00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,830
you've got the coin so that points a

00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:04,310
little bit towards one god is that my

00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:07,460
you proposed which was a reformed idea

00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:10,610
medicine a straw man for discussion was

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,730
a decentralized sharing common platform

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,870
imagine open B&B setting aside the

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,430
problem of chilling we're sleeping

00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:23,900
that's it's creepy and dangerous but

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:25,460
that right now where are the the sharing

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,460
economy companies are built on the fact

00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:31,540
that they simultaneously solve inventory

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:35,110
and discovery payment clearance and

00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,800
dispute resolution if we can

00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,270
decentralized be couple these three

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,280
things and secondly decentralize them

00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:43,940
then we have a shot to perhaps at

00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,410
producing open systems that are sort of

00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,060
community wide for the communities they

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,690
serve set of

00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:54,830
am i talking in the right direction well

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,840
it's it's a lot of different topics yes

00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:59,560
okay I mean II centralization is a big

00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,030
topic for years we've worked on the

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,670
search engine like in it for Asia we

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,580
make a front and for this search engine

00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:10,040
so it's decentralized it's been used in

00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,380
governments and so on so yeah we're

00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,990
working on this and decentralization is

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,400
definitely great but here also the

00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,070
question was in the past how to

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,680
commercialize it yeah so if we can go

00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:24,620
that way if there's maybe book channel

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,230
some technologies is a solution that

00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,350
would be great but like already

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:31,670
companies are using decentralized

00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,430
infrastructures themselves like even one

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:36,410
company can have different services so

00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:39,010
my argument was bored of that so think

00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:43,130
about the the hypothetical open B&B

00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:44,690
let's use an IP FS or some sort of

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,340
distributed ledger blockchain system to

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,780
deal with the story and the processing

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,910
the data and the listing and the

00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,470
discovery problem which are things that

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,150
these digital systems are good at these

00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,400
distributed technical systems are good

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,530
at you still have to solve payment

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,870
clearing and you still have to solve

00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,600
dispute resolution and this is what

00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,520
dispute resolution yes I turned up in

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,100
your house didn't exist or it was

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,780
extremely filthy or whatever or you

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,760
claimed that I damaged or else and

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,140
someone has to make decisions that

00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,110
service is worth real money

00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:18,440
yeah I Pels sweet half percent most of

00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:20,750
that is in fact disputes well this is

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,910
the question I mean like maybe here if

00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,090
we could learn from the open source

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:28,370
community right I mean like how are

00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:31,670
issues resolved here how are like

00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:34,100
disputes are resolved some communities

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,780
are better this and this and some are

00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,780
not like it was Asia we have the best

00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:42,230
practices which we try as a guideline

00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:45,680
and like most of the cases they work out

00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:48,980
and so it's it's a web of trust right we

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,930
had that discuss elsewhere so if you

00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,910
could form a web of trust and people say

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,800
ok I trust this person because another

00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,230
one you trust them you can use new

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,030
technologies that would be great but in

00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:01,700
that case again I'm asking like so will

00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:04,040
this all be open source so if yes then

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm yeah definitely for it

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:10,340
so like the open air BnB yeah like

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,390
something like that would be great yeah

00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,980
so but we need it open so that what is

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,750
the business model that's what I was but

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,020
what I was getting at was was you can

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:24,320
open the at the application but you

00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:26,869
still need human effort to resolve

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,850
disputes that's a real economic value

00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:31,010
people my actual money for that set the

00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:32,630
PayPal cases sweet Hafiz and every

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,960
transaction most of that is in fact

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,980
about dispute resolution that and in

00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,930
fact when the problems for blocked home

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,280
currencies is that that doesn't exist if

00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:43,310
I transfer money to you and then we have

00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,010
a dispute of heightened staffed and so

00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:47,630
there's this real value in providing

00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,760
dispute resolution services and perhaps

00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,230
allowing an open market for multiple so

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,330
right now if you're trading oil you're

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,859
not locked into one mechanism there are

00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,170
multiple units available that operates

00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:59,109
someone convicted Lee and they are run

00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,859
at a profit so you're building up

00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:02,810
software and other systems that don't

00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,580
have lock out but your question is how

00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,470
how to our would-be entrepreneurs that

00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,660
we wish to help accelerate how do they

00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,790
make money in this context in order to

00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,820
feed themselves so I'm having

00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,380
difficulties to judge when will we be at

00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,480
this stage to have the technology ready

00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,180
I mean when when will we actually all

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,400
use blockchain and instead of like

00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,590
normal money I mean there are some use

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,440
cases where it can be used now and it

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:29,480
may be for big transactions and like yes

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,030
but when it would be ready I mean

00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,350
there's a lot of talk about it so I'm

00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,770
not suggesting that it has to be a

00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:38,600
blockchain based money

00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,310
just whole separate question nothing

00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:44,900
else comes to my mind that could solve

00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:47,750
this problem but like then you you need

00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,160
it's a it's a bank and it's difficult

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,619
like to scale up at least in Europe

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,290
PayPal as a bank so it's difficult to

00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:56,570
scale up so actually I I like what main

00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,210
said like about the experience like

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:02,000
making small star or small ideas into

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,130
into like a break-even point into Series

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,369
a something like that I think that that

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,170
is what we would like to achieve and so

00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:12,230
the question is how can we

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,510
here I got a few ideas so that's that's

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,980
great

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,890
like we are looking for Mentors we're

00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:21,950
looking for partners yeah people who

00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:25,940
like to invest yeah so that that would

00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:27,859
be great and we are in a super big

00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,289
growing market yeah I mean most of the

00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:33,019
developers that we have are from India

00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:36,230
we have a lot in Vietnam in Bangladesh

00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:38,390
Sri Lanka so yeah this is where everyone

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:46,519
wants to go because here we need new

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:49,250
solutions watching examples is a

00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,410
technology but you need that people in

00:42:49,250 --> 00:43:01,640
process and so the person in the future

00:42:51,410 --> 00:43:03,260
may not be physical maybe another

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,000
reaction a dispute resolution I think

00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,799
you know it's all about kind of

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,900
governments and and then how do you

00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:10,579
actually so dispute resolution and I do

00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,079
believe that they're all earnings from

00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:14,630
the open source community how you do

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,269
government's in a community and I think

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:20,480
actually I don't think we should go to

00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:25,250
visa or to Bitcoin to kernel yet

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,859
whatever I'm inspired but actually how

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,869
our community projects solved in general

00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:31,460
in terms of dispute resolution and I

00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,920
think that's the future government's it

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,259
must be based on something some criteria

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,200
it doesn't have to be a centralized body

00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:41,839
like a PayPal or a visa no and that's

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,730
what is so powerful now I don't have the

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,710
magic formula what that would look like

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,990
but that's where I think the solution is

00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:52,519
I'd point out that it's already visible

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:54,170
in large markets between industries and

00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:56,210
chains if you're buying a commodity

00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,490
you're not locked into that that the

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,259
market for oil that they're only it's

00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:03,230
like to price setting markets in six

00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:05,720
secondary markets for light sweet crude

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,829
for example they're not locked into one

00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,450
dispute resolution mechanism there are

00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:09,799
competing providers of dispute

00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,630
resolution services that are used by

00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:14,089
participants in those markets and so I

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,309
think we can get away from the

00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:18,330
centralization and nonetheless but not

00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:20,820
always produce profitable businesses

00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,500
that are providing a real value perhaps

00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,670
at the handful of Nai perhaps not but

00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,460
that it's providing that has real

00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,230
economic value without getting into that

00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,060
centralized magnets hadn't thought about

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,280
these sort of local community level

00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,810
making sense that it possibly exist that

00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,820
might be a better starting point and

00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:40,410
maybe are the negatives used in Indian s

00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,320
markets so that yeah there are many

00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:44,700
things other than central solutions and

00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,040
I think a lot of those companies you

00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,170
know like you mentioned Airbnb you

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,150
mentioned you very mention LinkedIn you

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,300
mention PayPal how would you start these

00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:56,310
companies today yeah you know definitely

00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,980
not the way from a very centralized

00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:02,040
structure that they used to I would give

00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:05,280
you this example like I was one of the

00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:09,120
first LinkedIn users in in Europe and I

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,150
basically emailed 1,000 of my friends

00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,860
and called them and said do you want to

00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,260
use LinkedIn I've just sent you an

00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,700
invite by email and the other people

00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,760
would take up the phone what are you

00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,130
talking about well I trust me it is

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,860
something that will be useful so I did

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,930
that for 1,000 people and I and I got a

00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,970
small Eagle letter of raid Hoffmann

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:32,940
saying thank you I just like build my

00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:35,610
company and you know that was not very

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,560
sharing for my point of view we built a

00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:40,020
lot of value there right at least you

00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,450
sent you a note right so I think soon if

00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,360
I would start a LinkedIn or a PayPal or

00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,070
or an Airbnb or a yuba today I would

00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,110
start on the sharing principle that

00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,200
whoever shares get something for it

00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:54,060
right and that is way more in in my

00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,130
world than just the soul that I

00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,200
mentioned about the decent seller it

00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,700
could be way more because basic use

00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,050
sharing you're getting a benefit and

00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,300
that's what me I think he's talking

00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,280
about you know it's some kind of token

00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,380
or whatever it's gonna be cold right but

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,390
it's really based on real sharing not on

00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,760
these hype that we see out there well

00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,500
that's also a principle for a a system

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,190
based on openness and community what I

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,400
problem-solving

00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:19,050
rather than on exclusion and then you

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,100
externalizing costs so that when we

00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,720
haven't got time to touch the Atlantic

00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,850
finance question but actually that

00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,670
happens to be the basis for the Islamic

00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:28,290
financials it's an interesting piece at

00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,330
this one final question I want to put to

00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,580
panel but it occurs to me I forgot

00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:35,330
to ask the audience of are there any

00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:38,070
questions for the audience at this point

00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,620
we're putting everyone to sleep all

00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,270
right

00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:46,130
okay in that case I will now I'll tackle

00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:53,160
the final topic I wanna put to the panel

00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:55,080
yep yep so you last less thing discussed

00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,150
was something really interesting about

00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:00,720
that while sharing more they'll build

00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:03,480
into this new enterprises that are about

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,580
to be started and then force Asia

00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,990
incubator is one example of such

00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,570
enterprises so maybe you want to talk

00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:13,350
about that one a little bit how's gonna

00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:14,730
be address yeah right so if Mario do you

00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,300
want to describe the plans for the

00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,420
foster Jake

00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:22,950
incubator in this session or is that a

00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:30,120
topic holiday you mean like what we want

00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:31,860
to do building a well company with the

00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,230
social and parkour enterprise with the

00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,880
social part which was Asia is and then

00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,830
there was a question of sharing and

00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,380
participating and that being

00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:44,010
incentivized you know by you know get a

00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:47,910
structure or I can mention a bit what

00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:50,130
was Asia is I mean and so forth Asia is

00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,440
a community we also set it up as a

00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:57,840
company in Singapore which is basically

00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:59,520
to run the event and yeah so actually if

00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,830
we look to the US or Europe you can't do

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,160
things in the same way here in Asia like

00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:07,860
you can't just register an NGO and say

00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,290
okay we organize an event in China yeah

00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,000
I mean and as you can see the Linux

00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,340
Foundation for example they also set up

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,710
a company to set to organize the

00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,780
open-source summit in China I think so

00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,460
these were some challenges that we were

00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,050
thinking for several years and we didn't

00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,170
find the perfect solution so if anyone

00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:26,550
has ideas please come to me and I think

00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,620
we have the same thing when we organize

00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,820
something in India and and so on so how

00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,760
to how to

00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:35,220
yeah run run an event without an

00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,850
organization so so originally it was

00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,970
like a community mainly and just out of

00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:44,750
meanness and necessities we

00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:46,609
have organizations to run things so now

00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:50,150
is the times have changed I'm originally

00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:51,710
from Berlin right Germany so I saw like

00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:53,090
in the 90s a lot of people like their

00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,070
coding in the hacker space and the sea

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,540
bass and so on and actually nobody cared

00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,070
about money like even people say free

00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:02,330
software also means free I don't care

00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:03,560
right no need and ya think C&H I have

00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,810
changed but also in Europe they have

00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,430
changed and and they say at least listen

00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,020
I need to make an income I need to make

00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:10,910
money I need to find my family look

00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,890
everyone has a startup but things are

00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,869
growing so I say why don't we do this

00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,820
with open source and I'm a bit puzzled

00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:20,170
also if I look at the old ones if we say

00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:23,270
the the real model is the data and

00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:25,580
actually the software we are not solving

00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:28,430
software why Airbnb is not open source

00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,260
why Eventbrite is not open source if the

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,859
model is actually the data and not the

00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,630
software itself ok so it tends to be

00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:37,340
more on the Linux layer on the back end

00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,810
layer on different layers but we don't

00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,820
see it so much as a real complete

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,520
service like I like the services like

00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,530
WordPress for example everyone can run

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,089
it you can extend it it's a nice model

00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,980
so I would like to see more models like

00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,510
that where people can share it so I

00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,599
would like to support these kind of

00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,099
models and we don't have huge resources

00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,510
at force force Asia but we have a lot of

00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:57,890
contacts we have friends we have

00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,690
sometimes people will say oh yeah I

00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,450
would love to invest in something that

00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:05,119
makes sense for me and I think like in

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:08,740
order to make a real like successful

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,970
company in a way that break-even point

00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:14,570
generate income you don't need to

00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:15,980
million maybe you need 200,000 yeah if

00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,420
it's a free software company because you

00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,180
have a lot of people contributing and

00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:23,020
they can also use it for their business

00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:27,380
for example we have this event a system

00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:30,180
open event they it's not ready for

00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,370
everyone yet and but I would say

00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:35,640
and I'm not gonna run this in Sri Lanka

00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:37,860
yeah I'm not gonna run this in Korea so

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,370
it would be great to see people using

00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:43,140
these kind of systems and let's say take

00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,660
away some market share from Eventbrite

00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,030
yeah so things like this would be great

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,370
and actually we want to support this

00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:53,910
kind of projects and ideas people who

00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:57,120
make apps on open standards why not have

00:50:53,910 --> 00:51:00,530
an Instagram version in Japanese but

00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,550
it's not Instagram it's an open-source

00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,820
Instagram and we're all using the same

00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,200
standards we're all using the same API

00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,420
you can put it together and there are

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,550
ideas like I think for Twitter there's

00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,870
an alternative meta most and yeah people

00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,840
are starting this that we want to be

00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:22,260
part of this so it's what's great and so

00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:25,710
if you have ideas I'm happy to share

00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:29,040
more details like for example like we

00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:32,190
also own a small hotel in Vietnam and

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,680
one of our ideas was okay so let's see

00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,170
let's let's see this accelerator and

00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,880
let's see what resources we have people

00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,670
it's not it's not only about money it's

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,070
also about resources so why we don't

00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,990
offer like hey you have a startup you

00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,390
want to make a workshop why don't you

00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:50,550
come over for months stay in a hotel use

00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:53,490
our office use everything focus on it

00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:55,890
and what you want to do we help you we

00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,660
can like have calls together with

00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,690
different people in Destin so whoever

00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,060
can help to make your project run in a

00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,670
sustainable way so after you finish your

00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,650
studies you don't have to go really to

00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:10,410
work for a big company or like pitch

00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:11,970
with like somebody from the business

00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:14,250
department you can actually grow your

00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:17,490
own thing and I think this is what we've

00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:19,080
seen like as far as I understand from

00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,620
from Google and others they actually

00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,660
come from a tech background and yeah so

00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,970
I don't know so I think we can have a

00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,430
separate session on this but like it

00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,540
gives you a few ideas I will put one

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,550
final question I don't know we're gonna

00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,110
just slightly overshoot

00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,180
it'll be a question to Chris but it's

00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:38,340
perhaps main good well

00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,670
yeah hang on Bingham family my cousin

00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:44,370
asked you to motivate the question it's

00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:46,320
a problem with extrinsic versus

00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:50,340
intrinsic motivations and it's what

00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,330
happens when pour money into an area

00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:55,230
that's full of people who are doing

00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:57,150
stuff for love it and war volunteers and

00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,830
I think the way you express suggested it

00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,420
was it might actually be a violation of

00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,990
the social contract to introduce

00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:05,840
contractors you madniks you gave an

00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:08,370
example about teaching

00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,020
dolphins and chimps to use money I think

00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:11,700
and the question the quiz will be had

00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,920
has been out of way this so but please

00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,990
if you want to set up the question yeah

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,660
so I think the research shows that if

00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:20,580
you pay people to be creative they'll

00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,930
end up being less creative than if you

00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:25,170
hadn't paid them and they were doing it

00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:27,870
out of love and passion and the question

00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,730
of you know is the love of money the

00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,830
root of all evil

00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:34,080
it is I think there's recent social

00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:37,230
science primate research that shows you

00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,300
can train chimpanzees to participate in

00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:42,000
a monetary economy you can pay them in

00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,560
cucumbers you can pay them in grapes you

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,960
can train dolphins right any

00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,250
sophisticated brain is able to grasp the

00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,960
concept of trade and money and and if

00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,780
you don't pay a chimpanzee what that

00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,440
chimpanzee is worth it is it gets really

00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:00,420
angry at you and I feel like to a

00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,710
certain degree talking about paying

00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,230
open-source developers sort of creates

00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,450
this it sort of brings us into that

00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:11,130
world where we're sullying the purity

00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:12,390
and the beauty of it of course it's easy

00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:14,040
to talk about purity and beauty when

00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,660
you're not actually poor and worried

00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,490
about where your next paycheck is coming

00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,700
from so we have to balance these

00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:23,880
tensions yes so my question then to that

00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,220
maybe not so much not actually the

00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,430
direct problem of you engineers coming

00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:32,730
aboard remaining engaged but have you

00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:35,040
had the problem of bringing your sort of

00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,730
paid engineers into earth an existing

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,089
project

00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,260
and perhaps pursuing objectives that the

00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:43,150
project's existing Montana's I'm so

00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,700
excited about and all become disengaged

00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:48,130
because there was made guys sort of

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,109
pushing for stuff to happen sure I mean

00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:54,869
there's certainly our politics and all

00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:54,869
communities social we've definitely had

00:54:56,369 --> 00:55:01,900
disagreements technology wise political

00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:11,140
eyes muscular wise very polite I am

00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:14,049
saying has there been a sort of widely

00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:17,980
applicable strategy to limiting the

00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:20,920
scope will damage that that's sure so I

00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:22,480
think good project governance setting

00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,900
that up as in the talk before this

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:29,640
talked about setting up the Linux

00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,559
Foundation and how they run their

00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,829
communities and we've learned from Red

00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,270
Hat and we've been advising private

00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:41,079
companies on how to set up their own

00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:42,970
internal kind of open source communities

00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,490
as well so that's one aspect is just

00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:48,609
getting a company within itself to start

00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:52,049
sharing code across organizations and

00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:53,890
having governance and enabling

00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:55,240
contributions and collaboration there

00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,339
you heard that one last year actually

00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,930
from IBM where the idea that the

00:55:57,339 --> 00:56:01,150
connections teams source was invisible

00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:04,240
to every single IBM engineer on earth

00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,589
was unprecedented and some way they were

00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,940
getting patched there really bukas

00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:08,349
people they'd never heard of who they

00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,930
didn't know we're using this software in

00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:14,470
no it was bigger stuff to take about

00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:16,690
giving so yeah that but we you know I

00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:19,030
read how we tend to hire those folks

00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:20,500
that are already actively involved in

00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:23,319
communities and it doesn't matter where

00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,640
they live in the world but it it's more

00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:26,230
about what they're doing in the

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,270
community and the influence that they

00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:30,700
have so that we can leverage that and

00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,290
behalf of our customer base so those

00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,680
really the two thoughts would offer to

00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:37,420
for say that one yeah are you gonna do

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,740
anyway hire community leaders but the

00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,160
other is may close attention to

00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,960
governance

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,600
when this engagement has to happen

00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:46,790
because it won't always go right but you

00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,830
can make it go badly less frequently but

00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:51,680
their paintings would we're now over

00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:54,430
time so I think at this point may I have

00:56:51,680 --> 00:57:00,420
a round of thanks for the the panelists

00:56:54,430 --> 00:57:00,420
