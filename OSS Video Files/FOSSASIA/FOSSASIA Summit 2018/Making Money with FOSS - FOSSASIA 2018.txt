For developers who would like to make money developing free and open-source software (F/OSS) - whether as employees or as entrepreneurs - it is tempting to try to start with one of these models and stretch it to fit however neither of these models is even remotely suitable for F/OSS because both start by denying fundamental freedoms to share modify or even access the software's source code. It is easy to forget that neither of these models was obvious at the dawn of computing they both had to be invented and they're not the only ways to do it.
