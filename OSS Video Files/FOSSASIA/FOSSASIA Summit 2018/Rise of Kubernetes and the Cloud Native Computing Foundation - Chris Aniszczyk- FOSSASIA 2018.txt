We will discuss the lessons we have learned with containers so far including how Google (and other internet scale companies) have been developing and using containers to manage applications for over decade. His session will address the old world of node first development vs. the new world of cloud native computing along with discussing properties of a cloud native computing architecture – container packaged dynamically managed and micro-services oriented – and the benefits it can provide developers and end users.

Furthermore we will cover the formation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) along with the contribution of its first hosted project: Kubernetes.
