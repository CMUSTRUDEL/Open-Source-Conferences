Title: Rise of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation - Chris Aniszczyk- FOSSASIA 2018
Publication date: 2018-03-23
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Chris Aniszczyk, CTO Cloud Native Computing Foundation
Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#chris-aniszczyk3223

We will discuss the lessons we have learned with containers so far including how Google (and other internet scale companies) have been developing and using containers to manage applications for over decade. His session will address the old world of node first development vs. the new world of cloud native computing along with discussing properties of a cloud native computing architecture – container packaged dynamically managed and micro-services oriented – and the benefits it can provide developers and end users.

Furthermore we will cover the formation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) along with the contribution of its first hosted project: Kubernetes.

Room: Lecture Theatre
Track: Cloud, Container, DevOps
Date: Friday, 23rd March, 10:30 - 10:55

cool that works cool it's good to be

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,980
here so today I'm gonna chat a little

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,410
bit about you know I'm sure some of you

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,360
I've heard of kubernetes before has yes

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,219
is that a is that a yes people ever yay

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,800
how many people have heard of the CN CF

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,060
oh it's better than I expected because

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,740
most people just have heard of

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,100
kubernetes but have no idea what the

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,210
cloud native computing foundation is so

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,699
you know like I said I'll give a brief

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,130
intro and myself I've been heavily

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,769
involved with open source for which is

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,739
about two decades now currently I have

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,120
the fun job of serving as the CTO for

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,129
the cloud native computing foundation

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,480
and also the executive director of the

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,640
open container initiative which is all

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,800
about building container standards and

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
also I serve as a VP at the at the Linux

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,789
Foundation but in a previous life I

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,850
spent about five years running open

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,620
source at Twitter started an open source

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,710
company way back in a day around Eclipse

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,989
when people like you know developer

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,730
tooling at least back in the day spent

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,460
time committing on the gen 2 and Fedora

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,439
Linux projects and wrote a lot of JVM

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,140
stuff back at back at IBM but that's who

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,549
I am been heavily involved in the open

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,560
source for a while so I'm currently

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,369
enjoying now building out the cloud

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,500
native ecosystem so I will prefix

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,900
something before I start is so I do work

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,290
for you know CN CF but C&C F is part of

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,369
the Linux Foundation family of

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,500
foundations for a lack of better word a

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,840
lot of people don't realize that the LF

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,659
is more than just Linux you know how

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,340
many there have heard of let's encrypt

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,689
yeah right how many did you realize

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,670
let's encrypt is actually part of the

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,500
Linux Foundation it's like no one maybe

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,450
maybe one or two but you know we're

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,759
essentially a group of efforts that span

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,860
things from like automotive to cloud

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,259
which which I helped run so I just

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,380
wanted to prefix that before I get

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,240
started so CN CF is not that old it's

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,979
only a couple you know two and a two and

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,200
a half years old since I helped start

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,000
the foundation and it's been kind of a

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,430
crazy two years for me because it's just

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,500
been growing a lot faster than I

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,270
expected this is kind of little diagram

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,030
that shows you know when we kind of

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,360
started the foundation in late 2015 or

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,649
January 2016 not many people have heard

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,299
or even you know

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,730
knew about kubernetes and then it kind

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,230
of took off you know like a rocket ship

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,720
compared to some of the other competing

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,000
technologies out there also I had the

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
role of being involved in I don't know

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,959
how many people remember like the the

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,790
container wars but essentially there was

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,400
a lot of threats of you know hey we're

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,049
gonna fork docker and so on and so you

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,640
know we helped kind of stabilize that

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,310
with the open container initiative but

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,140
it's been an essentially a crazy to say

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,689
you know two years or so I'm helping

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,819
helping build these ecosystems so I'll

00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,260
give people a little history of kind of

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,470
what cloud native is people get a little

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,849
bit confused on you know what what kind

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,680
of technology were trying to build but

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,889
if you if you kind of like go back to

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,609
the early 2000s maybe late 90s it was

00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:58,260
very common for people to buy nicely

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,209
mainframe but you would buy like a spark

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,519
box from Sun right and then you would

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,590
like run your application on it and kind

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,920
of be happy but it was generally a very

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,930
single vendor approach you know you'd

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,299
run an app runs on a single machine or

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,180
big mainframe type thing essentially as

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,000
non-virtualized vmware then came around

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,579
in early 2000s and pop early is the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,400
notion of a virtual machine so now you

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:25,620
could stuff a lot of VMs you know on one

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,120
box great you're utilizing more of the

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,970
hardware everyone's happy you could even

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,329
run different operating systems

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,069
eventually AWS came around and

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,620
popularized the notion of infrastructure

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:41,729
as a service when they launched you know

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,720
ec2 and s3 and and all that jazz Hiroko

00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:47,040
came around and pop rised a notion of

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,409
platform as a service right so you could

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,060
you know beautifully you know Pat you

00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,729
know get your application get the

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,629
associate build pack get push magically

00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,639
launches then kind of the open source

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,099
version of these things started to come

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,109
along so OpenStack helped pioneer the

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,540
notion of a like open source

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:09,959
infrastructure as a service which is

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,180
super cool Cloud Foundry when inpired

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,549
pioneered an open source pass was kind

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,650
of the first major open source pass

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,329
great set of technology and then you

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,979
know for you know people are unaware

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,230
containers as a concept have kind of

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,820
existed for quite a while

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,250
but it wasn't really until docker came

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,500
along in 2013 that they really

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,950
popularized the notion of containers I

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,750
don't think a lot of that came to they

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,460
were able to provide eight great

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,930
experiences for developers so they had

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,550
the docker registry which was super easy

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,070
to like package and share things and

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,860
essentially took you know it really

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,230
things took off after that point CN CF

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,490
was really founded in kind of late

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,360
2015-2016 to kind of help bring together

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,730
these technologies kind of under one

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,620
neutral foundation but if you kind of

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,500
look at the history of this that the

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,810
cool thing about it is we've we started

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,850
in an environment that was very single

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,640
vendor everything was a kind of a closed

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,590
ecosystem and over time the the arch of

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,910
time you know since open-source has

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,850
gotten popular as we've moved to

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,790
multiple vendor multiple you know kind

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,170
of implementation ecosystem so you know

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,640
there's a lot of vendors collaborating

00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,470
on these open-source things and it's all

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,690
done in the open which to me is kind of

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,360
cool to see over time and I think we're

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,280
gonna continue to see that trend

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,090
happenin in other kind of verticals not

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,560
only just just cloud computing so what

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,560
exactly is a scene CF you know we're

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,360
founded in late 2015 you know the funny

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,760
story of kind of how I started the job

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,770
is you know I spent five years at

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,450
Twitter kind of focused on their open

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,310
source efforts particularly round the

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,990
infrastructure we were running

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,120
containers at Twitter before they were

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,590
even cool or even people called them

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,200
kind of containers so I had a lot of

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,640
experience and what happened was Google

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,890
open source kubernetes and they're like

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,600
hey we want to build you know a

00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,040
foundation around this we don't want to

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,130
be the full we don't want to own the

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,200
full thing because they realized if if

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,730
if kubernetes was gonna be successful it

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,590
cannot just be perceived as Google

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,960
controlled they need to you know open it

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,360
up make sure it's neutral you know put

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,700
the copyright IP in a foundation and get

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,770
other companies to contribute so we did

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,940
that and so for me you know after I quit

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,680
Twitter I was gonna go like you know

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,480
travel the world for about a month and

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,010
kind of just take time off after that

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,410
crazy experience but eventually I got a

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,850
ping from a lot of friends at the lice

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,530
foundation like hey Google wants to

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,510
build this crazy foundation do you want

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,710
to do it I'm like sure I've always

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,660
wanted to try to build an open-source

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,890
foundation from scratch so why not

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:41,620
it was a fun experience essentially CN

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,660
CF it could be thought of something like

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,160
the Apache foundation where you know but

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,200
were essentially a collection of

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,040
open-source projects but it is a very

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,350
set of high-quality curated cloud native

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,690
projects and when I say clown native it

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,090
has to do essentially something with

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:02,170
containers Orchestra it's getting a

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:06,610
little wonder if it's my phone I will

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:09,120
turn this off sorry I see it could be my

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:17,950
phone or it could be the Settings button

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:19,930
itself so you know like I mentioned like

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,720
CN CF were there to kind of curate a

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:26,200
highly highly quality quality set of

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,300
projects that are useful folks so you

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,710
know and our goal is you know you're

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,640
never gonna be able to necessarily

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,380
download like a kubernetes distro from

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,940
the CN CF website or any district for

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,190
our projects we essentially want to

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,230
allow our member companies to build cool

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,940
distros products and so on so that's

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,110
kind of how we operate which is kind of

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,480
similar like the to the Apache

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,280
foundation so you know like I mentioned

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,380
we're we're essentially a community of

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,450
open infrastructure projects obviously

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,860
kubernetes is our big one but I'm sure

00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,260
some of you if you're using kubernetes

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,730
already you probably have dabbled with

00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,690
Prometheus somewhere in there right

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,300
because you're essentially wanting to

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,790
monitor your cluster some of you have

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,160
may even you know wrote services that

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,080
use JIRA PC so we have a collection of

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,020
these projects that are independently

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,370
useful on their own but you know work

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,530
really great if you combine them

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,669
together in in various ways but we

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,860
essentially don't force any of this

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:21,400
enter into integration we have a variety

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,480
of members that are part of CNC F one of

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,220
the cool things at least from my

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,010
perspective that for the last two and a

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,419
half years I've been trying to

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,190
essentially get all the cloud providers

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,050
kind of working together in like a

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,370
neutral setting and so I you know for

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,990
like I think the first time in history

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,030
and like open source land we have all

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,680
the kind of top six or even top ten

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,650
o'clock providers in the world from like

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,780
Alibaba AWS all working together in the

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,550
foundation to kind of you know

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,360
collaborate and move the state of cloud

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,910
native Ford

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,890
so you know kubernetes everyone's

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,589
excited about it finally after all this

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,050
time what what is everyone exactly

00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:00,470
necessarily excited about well for

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,870
people that aren't aware kubernetes is a

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,230
kind of a weird term but essentially

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,730
it's Greek for you know pilot of a ship

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,320
essentially a pilot so you know

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,820
essentially you know the original idea

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,300
behind the name depending if you talk to

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,830
some of the original people associated

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,959
with the project's like Brendan burns

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,060
essentially you know it was always meant

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,790
to kind of represent you know a

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,410
essentially a pilot of a set of like

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,580
applications or containers running in

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,610
production so that's kind of where the

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,209
where the name came from but you know

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,730
what one unique aspect of kubernetes has

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:38,899
been just kind of how fast the the

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:41,300
project has been being developed we have

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,589
this kind of cool you know open source

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,720
project we developed to kind of track

00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,279
the velocity of how you know fast

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,010
projects are being developed if you go

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,180
to github.com slash ciencia field

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,520
velocity you kind of generate these

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,990
charts on your own but it's it's

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,940
logarithmic which just could be a little

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,430
confusing for folks but kubernetes

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,180
essentially ranks number two behind the

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:04,240
kernel in terms of like velocity of

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,410
issues pull requests contributions being

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,670
handled so it's kind of unique in that

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,500
regard and you know it's always

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,750
interesting to see some of the other

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,060
projects here if you look at like others

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,000
react there's also homebrew so it's

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,980
crazy to see how things have evolved in

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,300
terms of how fast things are going which

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,550
by the way like completely makes

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,089
managing stuff on github a huge pain in

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,709
the ass we wrote some cool tools but I

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,730
could talk about that like hallway track

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,800
or something later if people are

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,930
interested so what does Kubrick renée's

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,490
actually do you know why is it so

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,529
popular it really kind of solves a

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,880
problem of you know it abstracts away

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,560
kind of the underlying hardware and

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,620
resources associated with running you

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,060
know software you know it basically you

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,279
know I don't like the pets and cattle

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,410
analogy but essentially it it really

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,670
makes you know makes it generic in a way

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,050
where you don't have to worry about 'no

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,880
silly machines you're essentially

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,100
running a service that you know has

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
these dependencies and so on and it kind

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,790
of handles the distribution for you you

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,090
know the kind of the best analogy I like

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,830
to use is

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,120
some people may be familiar with posix

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,500
but you know in the way POSIX

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,270
essentially allows you to write you know

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,310
you know a script that will work across

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,140
different you know OS is in some ways

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,280
communities kind of does the same

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,680
concept for distributed applications and

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,090
you know under the covers you know I

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,100
kind of like the using analogy while

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,900
this may not be the best one but like

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,730
you know get you know a lot of people

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm sure bang their head when they were

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,690
first starting to learn get right like

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,340
oh it's a little bit confusing but under

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,810
the covers get is actually fairly simple

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,970
right there's only like a you know a

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,610
handful of object types right you know

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,830
there's trees you know you know blobs

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,140
and so on kubernetes is pretty similar

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,420
in I think the learning curve is a

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,250
little bit steep but under the covers

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,110
you know there's a kind of a fairly

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,850
somewhat simple you know object model

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,170
you know there's pods that essentially

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,600
you know serve as like the basic

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,550
building block for for kubernetes

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,340
there's deployments which you know how

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,690
do you actually deploy things pots could

00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,130
have services and there's kind of

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,710
namespace in terms of how you categorize

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,210
things and a lot of tools are built you

00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,190
know you know kind of using these

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,290
concepts from Corinne ADIZ the same way

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,240
like yet if you look at kind of you know

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,190
all the you know different command-line

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,510
options and tools out there the

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,270
porcelain commands are all kind of built

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,040
off those like for for objects kind of

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,050
the same principle here I think applies

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
for kubernetes so it is a bit of a steep

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,510
learning curve but once you get it

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,190
you're like okay kind of kind of makes

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,360
sense you know what are some unique

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,540
features of communities why are people

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,490
using it you know so you know obviously

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,410
the whole like you know self-healing

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,820
automatically schedules automatically

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,170
scheduling of like containers of

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,720
something like something like a service

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,360
goes down it's like a huge aspect for

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,610
kubernetes the kind of bin packing of

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,830
hey I want more services to run on a

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,710
machine and utilize more resources is a

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,690
huge is a huge driving requirement I

00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,400
mean it's one of the reasons you look at

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,590
kind of a large internet scale companies

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,600
out there like you know Google Twitter

00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,790
Facebook they're all doing the same

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,820
thing of basically trying to cram as

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,740
much you know software on each machine

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,870
to be able to utilize all that hardware

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,360
because if you're you know running this

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,760
stuff at scale and you're only using you

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,200
know sixty percent of your CPU or you

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,000
know twenty percent of your RAM that's a

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,770
wasted money especially if you have

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,870
support you know hundreds of millions or

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,220
billions of users so that's why people

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,460
are doing it you kind of have the auto

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,080
auto auto scaling rollout features and

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,230
and so on so it's basically everything

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,630
you need to kind of really build

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:33,720
distributed applications you know the

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,660
other thing I'll say is there are other

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,550
talks today I've saw that people are

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,920
doing like kubernetes tutorials and

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,000
other things so I highly recommend

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,970
attending those sessions if you kind of

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,800
want to get a quick easy start with

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,170
kubernetes how does the actual

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,250
development work inside the kubernetes

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,460
community easiest way I could explain

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,530
this is you know kubernetes is kind of

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,020
broken apart into what they call special

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,850
interest groups so if you wanted to say

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,190
hey I want to contribute to the

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,540
networking features in kubernetes you

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,040
would join the networking special

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,240
interest group and you know that's kind

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,520
of how they participate things so they

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,190
kind of try to you know spread out the

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,900
work of you know focusing on specific

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,280
aspects of communities and leave that

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,750
you know leave it to the special

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,910
interest group to control those specific

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,000
things in part of the kubernetes repos

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,980
so there's interest groups for all sorts

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
of different aspects so this is

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,620
generally you know how you would

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,870
necessarily get involved if you were

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,310
interested in contributing to two gray

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,060
days pick your special interest group

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:38,610
and go from there as I mentioned before

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,200
there are kind of talks later in the day

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,820
that people are doing tutorials but if

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,590
you kind of want to get with get

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,360
involved with kubernetes and learn how

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,610
to play with it I generally recommend

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,750
people start with mini cube it's a super

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,700
easy way to kind of just get a

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,010
kubernetes cluster working on your

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,810
laptop you know the other thing to note

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,550
is almost all like basically the major

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,010
cloud providers all do kind of like a

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,750
pic of kubernetes as a service or

00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,220
managed communities offering so you

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,130
could start there but mini cube makes it

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,920
super easy to get things working on your

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:11,460
on your laptop if you're interested in

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,890
contributing to you know the kubernetes

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,140
and CN CF community we are participating

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,120
in Summer of Code right now so you know

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,560
if you happen to be a student and you're

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,650
interested in contributing to one of our

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,300
projects go to github.com slash T and CF

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:29,990
such SOC and there's a bunch of project

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,240
ideas there so the other thing I'd like

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,010
to say like we are more than just one

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,210
project you know a lot of people are

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,650
like oh you're just like the kubernetes

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,570
foundation but like no there's a bunch

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:42,050
of other you know projects that are you

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,700
know super useful in CN CF and so what

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,270
we've done is try to build some tools to

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,230
help people kind of you know see the

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,450
landscape for for a lack of a better

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,950
word out there so I don't know how many

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,680
people have seen this diagram but you

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,480
know there's a lot of let's say projects

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,860
and companies doing quote-unquote clown

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,660
native things so we've tried to build

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,760
this out just to like we used to track

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,260
this stuff in like a Google sheet and it

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,400
was just a nightmare and we're like well

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,470
how about we do this like in an

00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,090
open-source way where we create a repo

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,670
and help the community track it for us

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,070
and build this out and it's been pretty

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,570
it's been pretty successful so people

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,700
love it and hate it but it's it's useful

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,200
at least for us to show you know here

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,570
are the projects that we have like in

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,220
like the you know networking space or

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,710
the service management space and here

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,920
are the different products and projects

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:31,460
out there so it's a fun experience but

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,260
you know it's it's useful to kind of see

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,810
how someone sometimes complicated this

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,970
stuff is what's really cool recently is

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,540
we created kind of an interactive

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,460
version of this so I don't know how many

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,230
of you have seen this but if you go to L

00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,820
dot C and C F dot IO you could

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,950
essentially filter and search for things

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,390
so you could for example when you see if

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:55,550
I could find this do you do need to do I

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:57,190
just opened up let me go find it let's

00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,120
see I'll just go back later but

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,320
essentially you could filter by like hey

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,730
I want to see all the projects that are

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,620
like in China or something like that

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:08,510
right so you could totally do that we're

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,940
also doing some interesting things in

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,890
service so like sometimes our landscapes

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,150
kind of dive down into like storage or

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,130
networking related things so if you go

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,080
to s dot C and C F dot IO you could

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,790
actually go see like here's like all the

00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,800
crazy like service projects out there

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,470
that people are building all either on

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,580
top of kubernetes or on other kind of

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,580
cloud-based systems

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:35,010
let's see where my trail map so another

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:39,030
interesting concept is when when people

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,860
are essentially moving to you know to

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,780
take advantage of kubernetes or moving

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,280
to cloud native there's usually a lot of

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,960
confusion in terms of like where do I

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,270
begin how do I start which projects to

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,430
use so we heard a lot of complaints out

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,660
there and like well you know when we you

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,950
know when I was younger we used to kind

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,480
of have like these like you can have

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,100
like a little trail map right and kind

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
of follow along and so like we try to do

00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,820
something we've tried to kind of take

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,340
that concept and apply it to cloud

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,110
native so we've built this to basically

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,510
you know show that there are many ways

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,580
and paths to kind of becoming you know

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,920
clown native and for some people that

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,680
may generally start with container izing

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,540
your applications for some people it

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,030
could be you know you already have CI CD

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,590
set up so you could start there you know

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,180
eventually you get to orchestration and

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,910
oh I need to be able to observe

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,380
everything within my clusters and here

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,460
are some useful project so we

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,720
essentially created this as a fun little

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,480
diagram slash tool to kind of help

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,850
people along along their journeys so

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,560
whether it's useful or not I don't know

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,230
but we were trying to kind of simplify

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,520
things for folks so there's kind of a

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,200
full journey that kind of goes through

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,940
in terms of our opinion of what what

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,700
people would take advantage of as they'd

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,760
be kind of become more clone native so

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,410
feel free to take a look at it it's it's

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,420
all online so you could you know

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,570
contribute to it you know pull request

00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:01,080
issues are always hopeful and and

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,360
welcome so I kind of will wrap things up

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,100
and hopefully leave some time for

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,080
questions because that's always more fun

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,340
so gonna wrap things up so a couple

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,230
trends you know that I want to kind of

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,150
mention before I kind of you know and

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,970
things speaking about like where I think

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,610
cloud native is going is open source is

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,480
super popular you know the previous

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,490
presentation

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,350
you know there's sousou's who's

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,760
mentioning like a three kind of distinct

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,410
phases of open source and you know

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,140
things are going on like you know it's

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,240
it's actually crazy to see like almost

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,610
you know if you have a TV at home

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,980
there's a huge chance that it's using

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,790
like open source software right everyone

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,380
has phones you know even your Apple

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,970
has open source on an android

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,820
essentially linux you know with some

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,640
stuff audit cars are shipping open

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,140
source software so you know it's we're

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,600
gonna see open source to be prevalent

00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,340
you know all around us and i think this

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
trend will you know continue there's

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,140
there's some studies out there that have

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,400
been done where it says like oh 78

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,600
percent of companies are using open

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,340
source i think that number is much

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,420
higher i think they just do like

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,160
companies there's no aren't aware

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,780
they're using open source but the cool

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,700
thing here is I think 63 it says 60 see

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,930
63% of companies are starting to

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,460
participate and actively contribute to

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,920
open source which i think is important

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,810
because you know open source is only

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,820
sustainable if people actually

00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,590
contribute and give back so seeing

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,030
companies do this whether it's like

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,670
actually contributing patches or

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,990
financially fiscally supporting projects

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,750
they depend on in communities they

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,360
depend on is clutch the other kind of

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,780
trend and kind of where CN CF came came

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,160
from is a lot of the inner internet

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,620
scale companies out there like Twitter

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,510
Google Facebook has basically open

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,660
sourced a lot of how they do their

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,640
infrastructure right you know tensorflow

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,590
that's basically how you know google's

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,330
you know handling AI netflix is

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,300
basically we're gonna open source

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,280
everything in terms of how we run

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:01,220
because at the end of the day you know

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,590
we make money by letting people watch

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,850
movies and TV shows and so on we're not

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,350
a software shop we don't sell licenses

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,330
to software so we're gonna open source

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,910
all the infrastructure so people could

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:14,090
help us to make a better better service

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,070
so you know that this has been happening

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,610
for the last you know you know probably

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:22,010
several er five five plus years now and

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,080
i think this trend will continue to

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,700
happen and so what essentially it is it

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,140
is being paired with the trend that more

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,450
and more companies or essentially using

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,950
open source and becoming software

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,410
companies so folks like mercedes-benz

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,570
and Daimler or you know all the sudden

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,130
trying to figure out you know how to

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,100
scale their infrastructure like is

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,510
inside each car you know is potentially

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,180
running Linux with open source software

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,070
that connects to some cloud that stores

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,410
you know information and has some type

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:52,010
of experience so what they're gonna do

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,930
is essentially copy or learn from how

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,410
these original internet scale companies

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,330
did it

00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,380
as you know Twitter and Facebook Google

00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,510
they all have to figure out how do you

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,850
support a billion users right so you'll

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,080
see this trend of other companies out

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,210
there that are becoming more software

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,640
related kind of use tools like

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:11,720
kubernetes and tensorflow to benefit

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,910
from their own so so that's basically

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,200
kind of the you know trends here I think

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,310
you know as more more companies become

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
software companies they're gonna use

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,150
tools like kubernetes tensorflow to take

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,050
advantage of kind of the work that has

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,420
been done before

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,970
so a couple resources are shared before

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,770
our opening questions we have three big

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,690
events in the communities in clown

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,580
native community we have one in Europe

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,500
coming up in Copenhagen that's about a
