In this session, Keya looks at how animations can be applied to add style and substance to any webpage and how we can identify some common design patterns to add purposeful animations to our designs.

There are a  plethora of development tools available today, from declarative CSS Animations and Transitions to fully featured JavaScript animation libraries like GreenSock to develop slick animations, but there's an upcoming new option: the Web Animation API! 

Join in the fun as Keya demonstrates how simple animated micro interactions can be developed with ease using this new API combined with popular frameworks like React.
