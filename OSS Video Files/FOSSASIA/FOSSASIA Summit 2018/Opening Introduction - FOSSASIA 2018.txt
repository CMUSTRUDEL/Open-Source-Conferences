see the various topics every single

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,920
topic in here happens because we are

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,110
dealing with open source software every

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,909
single component here isn't that amazing

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:06,600
and just to think that 20 years ago we

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,780
did not have the words open source why

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,700
it was 20 years ago that finally we

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,819
figured out that how are we going to

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,120
market

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:20,549
thing called free software and the open

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,579
source Inc was incorporated in in

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:26,560
February of two thousand ninety eight so

00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:30,189
to this year marks the 20th anniversary

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,670
of open source org so who's here from

00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:35,980
open source or org there you go please

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,450
stand up and please be recognized so

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,430
thank you very much for leading the

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:44,260
charge in open source it is all about

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,139
collaboration it's all about sharing

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,829
good information good code and having a

00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:52,900
lot of fun in the process so we are very

00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:55,239
thankful that we have an opportunity to

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,620
do events like this for Asia in

00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,909
Singapore this is the Harmony earth

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,219
event that we have this is something

00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:02,049
years already eight years eight nine

00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:05,290
nine years I can have a count your

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:08,829
fingers so this is a ninth edition of

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,569
force Asia and I think this is going to

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,340
be phenomenal because all the topics

00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,319
that we have are lined up and the

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,120
speakers but I think what's more

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,250
interesting is the future that holds

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,859
from here what we look forward to is for

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,359
next year's 10th anniversary hopefully

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:25,060
we will have an even bigger and more

00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:27,400
interesting event or plan but in the

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,870
meantime we have a bunch of things that

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,090
we're going to do to in over the next

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,859
three days we have code heat Awards this

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,139
is to recognize people who have

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,569
contributed and participated in coding

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:44,139
activities and a competition we will

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:49,599
hear a little bit more slightly later we

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:52,180
also have open source Inc sponsoring 203

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,129
nights to stay in Singapore for

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,479
participants were coming from outside

00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,329
Singapore so that they can participate

00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,879
in Foss Asia and I think I would like to

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,040
thank open source in for being the

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,579
wonderful sponsor of that opportunity

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,959
and the final thing in this slide is the

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,539
hackathon that we're going to hold that

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,849

Saturday so I look forward to seeing you

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,389
