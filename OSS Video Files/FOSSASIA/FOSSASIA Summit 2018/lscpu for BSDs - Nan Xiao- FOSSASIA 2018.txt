GNU/Linux has a handy lscpu command which can print CPU information of current system while BSDs lack so I decide to develop one used in BSDs. The whole task takes about 2 weeks and is divided into following parts:

(1) Study BSD program structure and sysctl APIs

(2) Refer Intel/AMD specs to implement function

(3) Test the program: thanks to kind people who help test on AMD architecture different BSD flavors and create ports.

In this topic I want to share the experience and lessons of developing first application for BSDs
