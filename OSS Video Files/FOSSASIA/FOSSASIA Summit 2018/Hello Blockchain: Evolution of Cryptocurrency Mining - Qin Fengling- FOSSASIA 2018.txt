When you heard about the Blockchain for the first time, you might have had a lot of questions about the technology. 

What does it look like? How does it work? Is it secure?

 Today, I will give a talk about the Blockchain from the miner's side. 

After the talk you will know: 

What is the Blockchain? 

Who keeps it growing?

 How is it secured? 

You will also get hands-on experience with BTC mining and can mine some BTC yourself.

is it okay I am talking about blockchain

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:15,809
the concept and evolution I will capital

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:20,490
currency mining we are mining companies

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:25,019
so this is the most powerful mission we

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:30,000
build for become mining I will talk a

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:35,010
lot about the evolution in the

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,120
blockchain we have experienced in this

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:45,300
year's first I will introduce myself

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,940
Tim family you can call me funny you can

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,800
find me in github and Twitter

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:56,520
I have commit to a lot of code in the

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,850
manner applications especially in the

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,520
pecan Manning and I work for Canyon

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,080
about four years

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,409
kenan is it's not a sick company in

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,930
china it build the Avalon manner so

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:19,439
Avila Manor is maybe someone do you know

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:23,729
the Avenue manner so is like maybe most

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,630
people know the Piedmont the build the

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:32,990
largest the manner today that way build

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:38,520
the earliest fpg manner in the beginning

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:44,329
so that's about me and my and company

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:49,619
the next is we start talk about the

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:53,340
plugin what is plugin always everyone

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,310
talk approachin it's like no one know

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,610
what his blog chain aaron has their own

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,090
concept about the blockchain so today i

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,570
will show you the beginning and what

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,679
happened today and maybe in the future

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:13,260
so it will I will talk about the rules

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,900
implosion it's it's the basic it's a

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,519
common

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:23,019
gross in every production today so let's

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:25,480
start first ever now the first

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:29,170
successful blockchain solution is

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,099
Bitcoin in the beginning a paper

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:36,190
released is called peer-to-peer

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:43,420
electronic cash system so it's very

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:48,250
early I think maybe after six years no

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:54,129
one know what exactly does it do but I

00:02:48,250 --> 00:03:00,030
will show a video about the pic on first

00:02:54,129 --> 00:03:00,030
so that let's say maybe someone know

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:27,690
what is Bitcoin bitcoin is the first

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:31,849
decentralized Ischl Soloff yeah sorry

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,849
contents of Sun may be here

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,780
currency pickle

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,660
oh no thumb so just like this

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,470
what is Bitcoin bitcoin is the first

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,090
decentralized digital currency bitcoins

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,590
are digital coins you can send through

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,480
the internet compared to other

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,430
alternatives bitcoins have a number of

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,410
advantages bitcoins are transferred

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,239
directly from person to person via the

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,459
net without going through a bank or

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,230
clearinghouse this means that the fees

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,060
are much longer you can use them in

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,370
every country your account cannot be

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,070
frozen and there are no prerequisites or

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,690
arbitrary limits let's look at how it

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,190
works

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,660
several currency exchanges exist where

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,450
you can buy and sell bitcoins for

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,979
dollars euros and more where bitcoins

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,669
are kept in your digital wallet on your

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,169
computer or mobile device sending

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,630
bitcoins is as simple as sending an

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:40,350
email and you can purchase anything with

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,560
Bitcoin the Bitcoin network is secured

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,479
by individuals called miners miners are

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,360
rewarded you we generated bitcoins from

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,220
verifying transactions after

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,030
transactions are verified they are

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,930
recorded in a transparent public ledger

00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:00,150
the coin oh yeah that's the introduction

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,180
of a Bitcoin when I watch the video

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:09,090
first I even don't know what it is so

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:13,289
it's hard to introduce what is Bitcoin

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:16,640
in the beginning so I will talk more in

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:21,360
the end the video I talk the manner

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:24,510
verifies the transaction so the

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,419
blockchain start from I mean the block

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:32,070
start from the Manning so the manner

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:34,680
verify the transaction and the new clock

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,940
will generate yeah it will exist

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,580
so let's look inside the blockchain the

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,580
blocks and the transaction this is a

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,580
beginning so it's a blog header and the

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,030
block date here so the block are chained

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,150
with the hash Travis Travis block hazard

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,870
the hash to the previous so chant gather

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,669
it called blockchain but nor in the

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,200
beginning in the Bitcoin the transaction

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,110
only can stores and like the payment

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,830
from

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,550
eight would be to another so just a

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,879
payment nor there's a lot of current be

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:19,569
the currency can store like the code and

00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:22,960
the storage someday so we store the code

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:25,960
it will relax the issue room so here it

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,979
it store the transaction will be store

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,860
more seems done Bitcoin so this is

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:37,000
instead of the blockchain all the same

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:41,289
we can say this is the market day

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,139
so because it's Yoram our largest this

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:48,969
is a latest state from Wikipedia and

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:52,120
also some website so we can say hair

00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:55,960
here and also blockchain the difference

00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:00,629
may be the the manner and the

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:04,479
transaction yeah so it's different but

00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:08,110
less these rules in the blockchain so

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,770
it's a same it has a voltage manner the

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,830
road network and full auction every

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:17,620
Fluxion has seen the forest even you

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,750
didn't mining it also has lacked rules

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:26,349
at lack manner so I will show a little

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:30,099
about what what what are this the first

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:33,279
is the wallet when you use the capital

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:37,599
currency you first in need of wallet no

00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:41,349
matter what happen is offline and online

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,690
so you can use any of this so different

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:46,449
is you can see here if you use the

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:50,319
offline you will store all the blockade

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:54,000
and first second eyes the plot eight

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:59,020
first thing you can use I mean you can

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,740
pay you can you can send the transaction

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:06,339
if you success the blockade but if use

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,779
the lightweight this is the common I

00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:12,159
think this is common because this is

00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:14,380
open source so I just put some picture

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,139
here you can try try to search any

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,950
offline all and pick on vol.8 or Bloxham

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:22,730
wallet so it's a same

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:26,900
this the only store some transactions

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:30,920
with your Bitcoin or ice and the blog

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:36,640
header so it so what what inside the

00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:41,120
wallet adjust the the Cape Air's is

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:45,650
private key and a public key so you will

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,890
use the public key it called pecan

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,330
address in the pecan in article on it or

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,630
maybe it's remote drastic something else

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,930
so you use a public key to receive the

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,840
payment and if you want to spend you

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,510
just need a private key here so you do

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,780
not need to tell aunt anyone is a

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:09,620
private Kate all your money we lost so

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:12,380
that's why this is generous here so a

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,530
lot of people want to use access just

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:21,140
door the private key in the hardware so

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:24,350
this very simple just keep here's so

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,380
wallet maybe you can use the private key

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:33,320
can do more sins but this is a original

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:37,040
idea of wallet the next is the full

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:42,350
blockchain so when you want to know

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,510
what's inside the blockchain you you can

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,260
see the block the real-time block

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,290
through a block explore every blockchain

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,770
has their explore but it will be same

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:58,370
length of blocks and transactions so

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:01,820
what's in the block its blog header here

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,540
so has the has his head and the time

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:11,840
steps it's a matter will use the plot

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:14,240
header to verify the transactions all

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,240
the transactions because the transaction

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,220
will generate it called a miracle route

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,830
here this can stand for all the

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:28,250
transactions so the manner only need to

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,380
know the block header so is safe so the

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,570
block date I made the transaction to not

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,570
need to send to any manners

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:41,360
so that manner gesture to verify this

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:46,330
and what instead the transaction so it's

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:50,240
a common transaction I captured last

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:53,660
left yesterday so we can say a is from

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,470
the left or to the right we can see here

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:02,030
this the input from this address and and

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:09,730
to this but also you can see how to

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:15,890
verify the payment here user scrap and

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:19,760
also it can today it can store extra

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:24,080
date you - Tate Tate storage but very

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,800
small here it means it cannot it can not

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,610
only use the for payment it can also use

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,490
to store some small data for example

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,570
like the prove existence test or some

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:43,010
date the harsh status tear so it can

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:46,400
also use the blockchain store Sunday but

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:50,960
if you slag serum me here is just the

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:55,090
state of code so that's the transaction

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,490
here and then I will talk about manner

00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:01,940
manner I think they're very few people

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,960
know what does manner do because just a

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,780
very simple word it's just the like

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,810
Fanta announced then it will okay so

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:16,820
manner is very hard to find announced it

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:21,410
just like the madam mat manner you'll

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,330
work very hard to find a goal so it so

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,200
ever show what's inside

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:31,250
it's a manor the manor it works like

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:36,140
this all the cryptocurrency Manor is a

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:38,240
harsh calculator the the left the

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,360
original hash function is Laxus from the

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,850
Wikipedia is a case to hash but the

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,009
character

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,979
currency manner will you like the

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:51,879
leftist blog header threat is also hash

00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:55,410
so the same concept so it may be this

00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,669
long because when you use hash it's very

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:03,339
it's very short you can use of an hash

00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:06,970
to stand for any transactions and then

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:13,359
so we can also call case here because

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:17,589
for explaining so the machine will do a

00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:19,720
hash calculator first use this some

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:24,309
words here and the generates the hash if

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:28,509
the hash I mean we we need it we need a

00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:30,549
way to to know which is or target so

00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:33,879
it's called a difficulty we started

00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:36,189
difficulty for the hash if the side of

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:42,789
cote like this they used the road who

00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:46,479
means if you fund this means you find a

00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:48,579
pork so that's easy so the machine will

00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:51,129
repeat the hash hash to find an answer

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:55,209
to find the target let's find the hash

00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:57,970
so if you didn't know the lat you just

00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:02,589
want to find the target so it's hard

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:07,269
here but in the real chain the 0 will be

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:09,399
too much more maybe 10 maybe 20 zeros in

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:12,149
the beginning either I mean in the

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:16,749
prefix so it's very hard to find a

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:20,769
target than a hash so that's the capital

00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:24,909
currency manner it's just like this in

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:29,289
the real Manning it like this so this is

00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:32,259
a screenshot of man software we can say

00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:35,409
it worked like this first it will get a

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:38,799
blog header from the network and then

00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:41,729
calculate the hash and then compare the

00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:44,829
target I mean with the hash if

00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:49,659
certificate then you've got the reward

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:53,799
if not then you must continue to

00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:58,000
calculate the hash so that's the meaning

00:14:53,799 --> 00:15:04,839
is the same so that's the manner

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:12,649
mmm I didn't talk about the through here

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:15,439
it's a lot you know so it's just a p2p

00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,370
Network it used for related transactions

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:21,470
you know when you transfer when you send

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,019
a transaction use wallet you need

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:28,720
broadcast your transactions everyone can

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:33,259
brought everyone can broadcast of valid

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,170
transactions it you can use some online

00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:39,470
tooth to generate valid transactions

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:43,310
then you can use a network to relay the

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:48,050
transactions so this is the routing node

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:52,430
so just as a rolling so that's the for

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:56,899
use in the blockchain I think it's more

00:15:52,430 --> 00:16:00,500
clear and the easy for ours to know the

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:04,670
rules everyone every currently currency

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:12,019
is the same and then we'll talk about

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:16,009
the evolution so the Bitcoin is the most

00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:22,579
mature currency today so it's growing

00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:26,509
fast let's say the history and what may

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:29,180
be the future from the start it comes

00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:34,879
it lacks other current coal currency

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:39,860
from the CPU and the GPU so this is the

00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:43,720
for Bitcoin so in the 2011 just a year

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,009
the CPU GPU because we didn't - no

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,829
because we just did to verify the

00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:57,860
concept so just use this so then we use

00:16:51,829 --> 00:17:01,009
a FPGA to accelerate the proof work why

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,769
why did it happen because if you you

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:06,140
ever know if if you use hardware to do

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:10,670
something it's or it if the hardware can

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,360
do it always works faster than the

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:19,610
software so it lacks the beginning this

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:22,100
is the software and this is something

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,480
that the hardware but if you use the

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,580
laksa fpj you can use special

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:33,140
certificate is fake

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:34,870
30:38 to accelerate something so it

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,940
change to the app city manner

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,790
it's very shot it's very Shawn even the

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,120
tan and here is even shot because a lot

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:48,350
of company I want to build a powerful

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:54,260
manner to verify the transactions so

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:56,630
later it becomes from the 2038 came

00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:01,130
through the ASIC minor so build the

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:03,440
Asics to verify the transaction so next

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,940
I will talk about why we need to build

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:12,530
this so we can say it grew fast in the

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:17,300
big con but in the other con you can say

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,490
maybe just here or here also some herbs

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,400
herbs the currency didn't want to ours

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,560
to use basic they want to use some

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,560
storage or all-district hard

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:34,120
Americanizing is the same if you use the

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:37,520
GPU you know the GPU mmm factory also

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,290
made custom hardware for the capital

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,700
currencies so it's also with a lot of

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:48,980
hardware or energy there if there will

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:53,990
be more people use the currency so it's

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:58,640
the same but we can say this is the

00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:03,110
history so I will show why it ate like

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,529
this the first

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:09,409
it's a difficulty it's the econ

00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,399
difficulty we can say because it's

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:15,200
proven work

00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:21,110
the difficulty is growing it's very high

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:23,899
today so it's hard for a manner only one

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:27,679
mine or the CPU or ATP manner to to do

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:29,450
this because you will you will spend a

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,360
lot of money and the waste a lot of

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:39,740
energy so it is not good because it like

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,130
the terrorism is is like if you have

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:46,039
hair hatred the difficulty will be grew

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,679
hair if you have lower heart rate then

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:52,850
also the difficulty will be lower this

00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:55,490
is the Bitcoin so that's why the

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,460
difficulty grew up and then the hash

00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:04,039
rate also goes up we need to build more

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:10,250
powerful manner to make sure it's it can

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:13,250
works is secure so ever no like this

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:18,139
from beginning the scale is maybe one or

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:21,919
10 manners for users but nor it like

00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:25,970
this so huge it's like the farm but

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:29,840
maybe someone used date center to store

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:34,690
a lot of manners so it cost a lot of

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,559
energy yes a lot of maybe hot air so

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:42,799
every people ever know that the Bighorn

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:47,110
costs a lot of energy yeah so just like

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:51,139
this but we can say we are hot too

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:54,169
we work hard to build

00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:58,340
Asics maybe every or we we will release

00:20:54,169 --> 00:21:02,679
a new chip we use the latest

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:06,590
manufacturing precise just make sure the

00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:09,250
energy efficiency to lower and lower so

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,669
you can say if you also use the machine

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:16,880
here it with lot of energy but today

00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,620
even 2-0 but but it is hard

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,700
hard oh it is hard because the

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:26,300
manufacturing process is also you know

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,910
this this nearly still the latest

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,810
advanced so it's hard also for the ASIC

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:38,810
for the fabless Factory it's hard

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:40,820
so today why we cost a lot of annually

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:44,420
because a lot of manner from hair hair

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:50,420
hair here are also are using they do not

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:54,740
want to drop because some in some place

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:59,390
the the cost of electricity is very

00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:02,630
lower so if you use this if use the

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:06,320
latest energy because you can see here I

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:10,970
will explain a little about this you can

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:16,070
say every year so energy will use the

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:21,080
will will like will be 50% of the

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:23,660
previous and also you will see the

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,680
performance I mean the heart rate will

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,080
grow up double so this is the chart so

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,950
you can say we will we want to save more

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,950
energy but the difficulty always change

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:42,140
too high so I think that algorithm is

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:45,140
not good even we can improve but I don't

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:49,940
know so that's we are working hard in

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:54,290
the Manning and also if you use like

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:57,350
manners like this you know because they

00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,060
need to get the blog header from the

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,210
network so it's real time so there's

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,440
very maybe fav solvent manners or

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,800
tensile manners

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,320
if connect to one server to or connect

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,540
to one node to get gets bulkhead it's

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,400
it's hard it's very hard so the server

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:18,260
cannot support so many notes

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:23,180
so today we can see the Manning a change

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:24,880
from the solo to straighten what we

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,920
consider different so in the beginning

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,159
when you use the CPU GPU me maybe you

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,919
know you just to connect to the beacon

00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:39,710
it's many alone and then you get all the

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:42,260
reward so this the previous asking today

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:46,760
there's no one uses because you you will

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:50,289
I think maybe you want to know what what

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,270
what is working or what it works in in

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:56,620
Bitcoin blockchain but it is a you

00:23:53,270 --> 00:24:00,250
cannot earn anything here so a lot of

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:06,220
manners use this drop mining so just

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:10,700
connect to a pool to Manning the block

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:14,720
so the pool will receive the reward

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,270
first and the distribute distribute to

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,240
the two separate manners the pool is

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:23,899
different the I mean the reward

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,450
algorithm is different so but but you

00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:29,179
can choose any pool you like so it

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:35,230
because the pool connect the pool is a

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,230
foe note and also I will show here

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:45,540
the pool is just like the poo is just

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:49,470
like this and this act to my two rules

00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:54,660
here so this is a poop and or manner

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:55,910
just a part of this so today it is very

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,790
hard

00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:01,920
everything in the VidCon a small stir I

00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,260
think it's advanced who changed

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,610
something to save the energy to solve

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:13,110
the problem in the capital currency but

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:17,870
it's hard and today we can say a lot of

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:21,930
poos salmon are larger because they have

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:26,880
large heart rate lock heart rate means

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:29,450
you can verify fast than the other but

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,790
but also you know that the hash is

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:35,580
random so you can connect to any proof I

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,070
don't have any instance some of yours or

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,950
want to know which is the best which one

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:44,610
I want to use so when I answered this

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,370
question I will say anyone you like

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:51,810
because it's just the same you just

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:56,550
treat him protocol but the cover is

00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:59,250
different so it's better to use this but

00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:02,820
also you can use this I like force

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:07,110
because I used like so I used like the

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,760
channel it's very it's very small so

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:12,930
everything you can use you can also

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:16,200
build your own pool if you like because

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:19,020
it's the the largest manner because all

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,410
the basic manners connect to the pool so

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,990
to construct a lot manner so this is the

00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,810
pool today so it means there's a lot of

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,060
manners there no matter maybe this is

00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:33,210
from Kenya and this is from bit mines

00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:40,370
it's from another manufacturer can also

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:45,270
connect to the pool so this is about the

00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:48,090
this is today about the big con so a lot

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,300
of seeing needed to improve to make the

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,300
batter

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:59,080
so what will happen in the future what

00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:02,380
will lack the manner or the hardware or

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,100
something we need we can improve the

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:09,550
blockchain so let's talk about the

00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:13,090
factor maybe I am not sure so first

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:17,470
eight the consensus the algorithm so

00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:23,050
this is the this is for blockchain so

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:26,559
one consists of Artyom maybe can mmm you

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:29,770
know the some of talk horn something

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,600
like that so one algorithm can support a

00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:38,260
one or more criminal currency so you may

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:44,559
be the year they used one commanding a

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:48,040
lot of capital currency so some or a lot

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:53,320
of algorithm will be I think will be fun

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:58,120
to make the make the community I mean

00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:03,520
make the blockchain or house most Runner

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:07,059
like this and I don't know so even today

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:11,320
we didn't find a good group good artyom

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:17,860
in this so a lot of proof and a lot of

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:21,280
capital currency so even email exists

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,740
are saying it's hard it's hard because

00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,929
you know everything

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,200
it's like a manner so even didn't

00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:34,150
manning use this so also is hard to find

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:43,140
a great air ISM so is hard so this is

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:46,740
consensus so I I also want to say is

00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,570
they cannot compare it's not comparable

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:53,890
so a lot of different software or

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:58,179
hardware need to do yeah and the next is

00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:01,779
the framework and this is mm a framework

00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:06,249
be used in blockchain

00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:09,549
everything if we want to make some tea

00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:12,239
apps today so we will based on the

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:17,049
blockchain protocols so it's a very

00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:22,210
basic layer it's layer to the low-level

00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:27,009
is analyzed today so we all know the the

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:29,830
apps today are also not easy to use

00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:32,409
maybe some can block the blockchain

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:35,200
I mean the block the transactions so

00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:39,789
also happening in Bitcoin you know your

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:44,499
transfer maybe you pay implosion you

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:48,099
need maybe you need wait if you your

00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:51,609
payment is very small maybe you need

00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:57,089
wait one or two weeks to way to confirm

00:29:51,609 --> 00:30:00,539
so here is very vague today and a lot of

00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:03,820
ASIC company want to build powerful

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:08,349
hardware to accelerate this layer so I

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:12,190
think in future we need more hardware

00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:14,440
like like the router like the switch

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,690
will act like that in network we also

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,879
need something if you maybe called block

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:25,539
can accelerate layer here so because a

00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:30,039
lot of different current of currency we

00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:35,919
need accelerator to make better apps

00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:38,349
yeah and that I just call this maybe the

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:43,450
blockchain service will be serve a lot

00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:48,639
of area so we can imagine there will be

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:53,769
lots of lot of protocols here so maybe

00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:58,509
we need a Manning or crypto standards to

00:30:53,769 --> 00:31:02,049
make sure it works today I can share

00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:05,859
about the some crypto currency it it

00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:08,529
works like it called merge mining so if

00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:11,409
you're just a Manning maybe Manning the

00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:14,690
Bitcoin recommending other coins at the

00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:19,010
same time so it's also good you we can

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:22,820
the older man hardware maybe we can use

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:25,340
one like we need a standard I mean we

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,400
need a standard to accelerate all the

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:32,330
blockchain so I don't think we we need

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,990
to recreate Aries everything so we need

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,980
standard

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:42,340
so that's or for the future maybe it

00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:48,680
will happen but today we can say like

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:52,910
pick on that coin a serum some someone

00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:55,670
or a friendly with the ASIC someone are

00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:59,090
not so it's hard

00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:01,970
also it's hard also in the big con

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:05,570
another scaling Bitcoin also is hard

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:09,680
even in the block size or even the block

00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:13,510
header so even is hard so I think make a

00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:19,580
standard I also maybe a future so it

00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:25,700
it's hard and it's next its demo it's

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:27,410
demo about a manner so you can everyone

00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,450
can learn the blockchain through the

00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,750
through the manner in the beginning you

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,720
can use like the CPU manner but today

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,630
you can use this this is a powerful

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,650
manner you can use Aaron can try adjust

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:45,530
a towel a little Boston Manning today so

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:50,230
you can use a manner the bullet and the

00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:53,210
pool so everyone can try I will show

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:57,400
this this is a configure it in the

00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:01,190
manner so formatting is very easy just a

00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:05,810
fearsome the pool I mean the full

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:08,750
address and your user and it's enough

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:15,740
then you can see the status of the

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:19,180
Manning so I think for this everyone can

00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:22,520
try later so I do not want to visit him

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:26,350
here so I can ask why I can answer some

00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,350
questions any questions

00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,059
hey Rick one

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,679
different shapes here

00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,490
hush

00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:53,470
yes yeah this from Canada yeah yeah it's

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,380
from Canon because Canon has wrote all

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:59,280
the cert 8 the information the Wikipedia

00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,280
you can solve that

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,100
yeah

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,579
yeah lettuce for one you can say it's

00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:23,700
rude you can say it's a heart rate in

00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:27,149
the Wikipedia so one you can hear you

00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:30,419
can use this we always use this

00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:35,309
it's called bar / G yeah yeah

00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:48,440
it's nearly what their upon to 10.1 so

00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:48,440
it's powerful yeah yeah yeah

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:57,290
and that's the number here because we

00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:04,190
need just the convert comer this - we

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:11,780
didn't calculate one one shape just yeah

00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:14,410
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no it didn't

00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:17,540
release the latest so maybe it will up

00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:23,510
upload the latest it's a last year from

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:30,130
the last year so we also yeah so it will

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:30,130
also use the latest maybe the seven yeah

00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,830
for this

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:46,480
only one or large Harry is not but you

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:48,700
can and by animal a lot through the

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,850
website from Canon yeah

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,760
also it man everything is same but this

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:58,570
thing is mostly easy to connect you can

00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:02,950
see one controller concerned support

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:07,200
lots of 20 manners so it's different so

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:10,200
every manner has their different team

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,200
yeah

00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,130
yeah

00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,980
very

00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,300
yeah

00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,309
yes

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:49,369
it can but very slow you can you can

00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:54,079
calculate the the profits through the

00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:56,359
cat it has the calculator in the some

00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:02,539
website you can search because you you

00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:05,390
need to improve your press of like

00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:08,180
electricity and you re cost something

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:17,420
else so it's different so you can

00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:21,680
calculate yeah yeah yeah yeah so I I

00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:25,730
just talked about like one it's called

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,910
the consensus arisen so one if you use

00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:33,739
one it's different with others yeah so

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:39,049
you can use this to man to man Manning

00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:43,539
the sha-256 like this the manner like

00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:48,200
the master likes a dog con named corn

00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:51,859
because the same era zoom so one yr ISM

00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,380
can support a lot of current the

00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:57,339
currency yeah but it cannot support the

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,339
RTC

00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,450
yeah

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,049
the limitation of dressing is because

00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:15,550
the action is specific to be fun is very

00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:20,970
efficient

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,970
you want there she is a question

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:31,500
yeah yeah if you use GPU I think the

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:35,040
most important a also cannot earn yeah

00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:38,760
pick one yeah it's hard so we you know

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:42,060
in the latest manner or be bunam we use

00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:49,020
more than 100 shapes and course I think

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:55,110
maybe more Docs one a six always has 100

00:38:49,020 --> 00:39:00,270
mod 100 course so many maybe yeah it's a

00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:03,450
10000 course yeah yeah we can we can

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:07,410
yeah we can show maybe your initial

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:11,310
outside yeah we can also yeah we can

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:14,940
turn on here the Sun is it's very noisy

00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:18,090
yeah it's made combining so I think we

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:22,590
have more time to talk about it maybe

00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:26,120
the apps based on the Bitcoin and also

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:29,640
everyone can try this use your own

00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:33,720
Bitcoin wallet if you like you can use

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,870
your own online or offline if you use

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,970
war mobile you can try to download and

00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:42,020
like the bid pay something else if you

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:45,020
like we can try yeah make a trial later

00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,020
yeah

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:54,510
I just mean II

00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:04,809
aha

00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:10,420
it's very few you know only block header

00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:17,559
and some Merkel branch so it's very few

00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:20,499
eight icing eight about one backpack one

00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:25,210
Magpies is enough but it's better if you

00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:28,180
have faster pen base because you need to

00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:31,859
submit your share as quick as you can

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,859
oh you will be lost yeah

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,100
yeah yes you need to submit a stare to

00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,100
the pool first yeah

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,110
for me different pools are different

00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,710
don't see me

00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,040
yeah

00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:24,040
yeah maybe so it's hard someone so a lot

00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,980
of people want to use the large spoon

00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:31,000
here yeah it's good so you do not need

00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,920
to build up your own poo yeah so it I

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,110
think it because it's decentralized so

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,820
everyone can connect with their own poo

00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:45,010

you need to because why is this or a lot

00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:51,010
it's because we they make a great effort

00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:56,970
