hello there we go okay good afternoon

00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:22,100
everyone welcome to our afternoon panel

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,710
on blockchain and the world's problems

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,110
we have many problems in this world and

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,460
obviously you can change it by um making

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,180
lots of money with bitcoin something

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:36,980
like that um so we have a panel um is

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:40,340
your nurse it's right here there's a

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:46,399
book as well over there um cherry I

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,320
believe Jolin and you look oh he's not

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,790
here

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:55,540

00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,410
and they're going to discuss how we can

00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,089
do really horrible things with

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:06,470
blockchain to make the world better so

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:10,240
horrible things with it of course so

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,240

so I just want to do a quick

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,380
introduction about the pan No

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:44,790
okay so I have a liquor here blockchain

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:48,149
it is a hive technology in this panel we

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,020
want to know what our true real real use

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,570
cases of long chain apart from the hive

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,759
as you know in Singapore recently for

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,320
the past few months every day in

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,179
Singapore in the evening when you go out

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,250
it always about blockchain a lot of

00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,920
meetup about a lot of events going on

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:10,410
here in Singapore it is always full of

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,690
people so it is a is a hype here in

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,989
Chinese let's go hardcore it's a correct

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,989
chillin hardcore it is something that

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:21,690
really hot at the moment but what we

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,810
actually want to know can block change

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,000
solve any problems of the world the

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,010
panelists today will provide insight

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,380
into their projects and planned for the

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,870
using of blockchain most of long chains

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,989
are using false infrastructure to my

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,940
interim their network what is the grow

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,760
of open source in the projects and

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,829
companies of the panelists how there is

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,860
the open ecosystem benefit from the

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:49,200
training of blockchain technology

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,290
enforce Asia our koi to improve people

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,940
lives in will open tag technologies like

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,790
blockchain raise the question about the

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,799
impact on people and in the world it

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,190
takes a lot of energy to generate block

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:05,489
chains there is no immediate benefit

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,440
except of the corn itself there is no

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,480
immediate value of product or anything

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,780
or human could use except for the

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,329
transaction of value what should be the

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,660
spec of those social responsible

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:21,030
organization in diversity questions came

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,160
blockchain solve the world problems and

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,240
reforms before we start the

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:33,330
I know I would like to introduce our

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,330
panelists again hey some of you was not

ok so we have here

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:45,040
yonas born Milewski it key so he was a

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,190
keynote speaker yesterday for the

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,830
opening about open source within them

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,460
though so I if you know what I would

00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,140
like to take and you're a short bio so

00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,420
the people here you know silver

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,730
understand your background in Sojourner

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,420
house a diploma in computers a computer

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:07,480
science and Japanese 34 University of

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,580
Bonn the main focus topics are metadata

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,950
data quality as well a new neutral

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,310
network within download

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,140
he was holding architecture Rose for

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,410
finance system in various leadership

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,000
position his he has a keen interest in

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,730
new technologies and open source

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,710
movement and in his current role he is

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:30,070
wrapping the blockchain and distributed

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,750
ledger technology activities from the

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,990
technology perspective within them doe

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:41,440
and Jana see also a member of the

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:49,750
government or fiber ledger the second

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,900
awesome yeah it's so serious

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,680
most of you probably knew him as one of

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,860
the organizer of course Asia but apart

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,110
from death Rowland's intership privacy

responsible for the company's

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,560
information policy in practices were in

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,590
Singapore is also its early member of

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,660
the hacker space heroes a computer

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,720
scientist read from the University of

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,259
Technology Sydney and he isn't I fake

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,729
pencil well I knew him for the

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:34,370
classifier even seen you dance even once

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:36,889
and he's a runner and also a ham radio

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:44,050
operator with a particular interest in

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:48,590
space the twelve annulus I have a I have

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:51,220
Jerry Matthew so Jerry just arrived

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:57,050
today from KL I'm saying you are on town

00:05:51,220 --> 00:06:00,520
Thank You Jerry is a super mo with a she

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,380
only put elaborate and political views

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,570
analysts and attendant a tendency in

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,310
some false contribution mostly to their

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,860
I believe free best the operating system

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,360
not be at least okay good and it's a

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,830
software engineer he has written

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,120
programs which are mostly used invisible

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,090
they do something that nobody can see

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,880
him as a hardware engineer he has pure

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:31,220
enough autonomous fruit-picking Pro pod

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,949
we was very user visible and he also a

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,650
founding member of two hacker conference

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:43,039
hack Beach and Hugh has India know the

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:51,490
third panelist I have here because it's

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:51,490
treated okay so this is um Jolin Chen

00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:00,650
Jolin is a relator implosion architect

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:03,409
of flow chain dot IO an open source

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,199
space IOT approach and solution before

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:08,029
flow chain he has been working on

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,409
embedded software and for staff web

00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:12,619
development from

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:15,909
years hit research interest distributed

00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:17,959
ledger technology and IOT data security

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:20,149
Jolin has a Master degree in

00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,179
manufacturing information and system

00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:26,499
from the National chang-jung University

00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:38,209
of Taiwan welcome okay

00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:41,599
service question of the day I would like

00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:45,050
to start with the first two question for

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,529
the panelist here what is your interest

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,839
in blockchain and if your company are

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:54,589
currently doing still doing something

00:07:50,839 --> 00:08:02,719
with pop chain who would like to start

00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:04,189
first Jolin I see yeah so what I'm

00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:06,110
thinking could you explain a little bit

00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:22,990
about your company and what are you

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:25,800
currently doing with poaching IOT

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,849
especially

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:34,339
need a variable solution of IOT protein

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:39,149
and however hollow layer are already

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:44,790
brought in systems such as hydrogen and

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:49,920
helium but this protein systems can now

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:55,800
fit the needs of the IOT path tree so I

00:08:49,920 --> 00:09:02,660
left my provision of the company to my

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,660
own fortune company and have a pouch

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:21,829
so another tab it's because there are so

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:27,269
many persons they we can now your softly

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:33,589
so I can hear especially to learn from

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:33,589
you about our problems and the solutions

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,649
so I have a

00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,730
very broad range of interests are not

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,259
active in any blockchain related

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:49,939
activity at present I am extremely

00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:51,499
interested in what the various

00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:53,809
blockchain capabilities in fact is it's

00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:56,259
three separate abilities forget whatever

00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:59,239
one umbrella what they mean for

00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:01,279
technology for market development and

00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:05,660
especially what they mean for a source

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,829
of free software and the associated how

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,329
we make money at this thing so there's a

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,259
it because of the default open the

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:14,089
tendencies of the open source community

00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:17,569
and the default open tendencies of

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:19,790
blockchains I into it a big overlap but

00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:23,989
I don't yet have a specific application

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,089
that I'm issuing you said interested in

00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:28,489
bar chain and currently not working on

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,209
any application but is there anything

00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:34,040
that you see in the reason I think that

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:39,379
I think there's a general category of

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:41,089
things so I I'm not a fan of proof of

00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,649
waste but I think it's a so the base is

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,049
a Bitcoin and County or 3m is a terrible

00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,239
idea

00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:49,189
money is about the ability to obtain a

00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:51,439
present to select present-day token in

00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,809
the future they value and so things that

00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,879
could that computation can measure

00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,980
computation storage communication and

00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,519
power the future delivery of those

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,959
things is a direct valuable thing that

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,359
can be turned into a point it's like

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,339
this is a very broad category but I

00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,539
think certainly for IOT will come up and

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,829
a bunch of other categories we've been

00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:14,299
to other areas

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:16,699
the idea of issuing tokens that are tied

00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,959
to future delivery of things that are

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:20,119
economically valuable and can be

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,910
measured by a machine is going to be an

00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:24,980
absolutely compelling class of uses the

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,449
block chains how that looks today I

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,100
can't guess but I don't think there's a

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:32,269
waste is a little work if you like but

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,739
sorry that needs justification you

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:38,179
you're looking for any cryptocurrency of

00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,679
any sort you're looking for proof that

00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,749
work by there has been done or will be

00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,149
done the category of work that is

00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:46,220
currently most popular is proof of

00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,520
intentional waste in the past

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,399
that's Bitcoin which as

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,140
there's a derivative of w which is the

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,940
derivative hashcash it's it's it's a

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,620
long transition to this thing to prove

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,430
waste in order to eliminate certain

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,140
kinds of abuse that's not the only kind

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,339
of proof of work that matters so when I

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,470
make the distinction I'm not just

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,140
insulting it I am saying that although

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,310
the work is important proof of waste as

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,830
an example of proof of work is a

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:15,040
terrible idea and it will not sustain

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,080
its addition even if you try to move for

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,640
the credit-card transaction volume onto

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,709
a Bitcoin you would need more power than

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,470
his generator on the planet its yep

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,270
that's that single will at some point

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,850
become rational but I really do believe

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:30,520
that there are a whole kind of things

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,680
where future Lybia value that machines

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,200
can measure will have direct application

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,390
for watching thank you very much

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,860
so Jerry so we had a conversation before

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,390
so we here now Jordan doing some like an

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,000
application for tea and Rodan also

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,360
mentioned a few potential but you told

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,339
me before that you don't believe that

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,740
blockchain have any positive impact what

00:12:51,339 --> 00:13:06,790
if I don't say never could you talk a

00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:09,279
little bit about your motivation here

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,930
sure I mean for a start maybe I should

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,709
give a bit of bank background I'm one of

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,560
the guys who heard about Bitcoin in 2009

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:20,170
early 2009 at a point where you could

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,510
really run in your home PC and you know

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,990
be a millionaire now and I deliberately

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,670
stood you know stood by I have the

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,290
programming skills get on board but I

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:35,350
deliberately stood by the wayside and

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:37,990
you know saw that train go by but the

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,029
the real context apart from that is that

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,360
I'm a colonel for grammar and

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:45,010
a colonel is a very complicated

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,750
distributed system if you like and the

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:53,529
core technology behind blockchain really

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:56,290
derived from lamport's work way way back

00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:58,749
and you know I looked at it as a

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:03,189
technology project so I'm coming at it

00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:05,290
from a computer science angle and also I

00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:08,560
ran a hackerspace in the rural village

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,199
in India for two years and helped start

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,439
a hacker conference so have been hearing

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,139
lots and lots of chatter about various

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:21,249
kinds of technologies and so I'm coming

00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:23,319
at it with the eyes of a critic I don't

00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:25,420
want to take a particular position right

00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:27,899
now but maybe as the conversation

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,269
progresses I'll make my piece more clear

00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:35,740
thank you very much

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:37,240
yes so would endeavor so my first

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,579
contact was a little bit later than

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,910
yours it was 2010 when a friend came to

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:46,180
- that you have to do it this is like

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:49,180
insane genius and I thought you know

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,759
this guy has super crazy ideas so

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,209
interesting concept and I was looking at

00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,639
the technology at that time yeah but

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,709
nevertheless I missed it - bye

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,750
or actually invest into a hardware to

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,879
mine something yeah

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,000
then several years later at work

00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,519
somebody and I was talking about that

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,899
technology and somebody came around the

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,309
corner and we you have to do something

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,559
with it yeah we have to do a project

00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,629
yeah I was like yeah I know something

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,269
about it so I want to do I'd want to

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:22,029
help and then it went really crazy

00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:25,449
because everybody then the hype kind of

00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:29,079
started and now what we are doing is

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:32,379
we're investing in pcs pilots whatever

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:36,790
in terms of using the technologies for

00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:42,100
for enterprise great applications and

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:45,699
also I try to demystify actually a lot

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,759
of the fuss in the hot air about the

00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:50,949
blockchain hive at the moment and I try

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,670
to bring it down to ground and try to

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:56,889
find applications that are really that

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,070
you can really set up with blockchain

00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:02,070
yeah that you can really do with blocks

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,050
and not just put a label on and say yeah

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,560
it's blockchain because it's the hype

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:10,700
now so are there any real application if

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,770
you are using right now in the company

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,900
yeah I mean yesterday I shall one thing

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,240
is where we that's not a work problem

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,390
let's say like this but it's a small

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,390
problem so driving not very efficiently

00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,670
yeah we are trying to solve what we're

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,390
actually trying to achieve is to change

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,570
behavior

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:32,660
yeah so do two means of incentive ation

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,750
something very abstract a cryptocurrency

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:39,780
behind that we try to incentivize if you

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,650
drive greener yeah and then you probably

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,150
also pollute a little bit less

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,570
nonetheless if you have a big car then

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:51,990
it's not fair to say that but at least

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,730
try to change behavioral aspects with

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,310
incentive asian which is totally

00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:02,880
abstract because nobody knows what to do

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:04,620
with it now i want to go back to john

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,350
and could you explain a little bit more

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,199
as a user perspective what can they do

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,850
with the protein what are the service a

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,459
that you offer

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:18,209
okay for me most of our approach and

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:24,689
technologies especially for the health

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:28,230
insurance p2p appear to pay payments and

00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:33,120
however there were no protein

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:38,940
technologies for IOT devices so the

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Fortran started in 2015 to develop a iot

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,540
protein systems are you cancer safe

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:52,050
Roger is an veggie system over the

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:55,400
operating system for devices so we have

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,860
already developed algae okay

00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:03,610
the applications video surveillance

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:06,590
systems which must ensure real-time

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,410
translations for example there it's

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,250
about such friends with your friends in

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:16,670
a second most of the editing processes

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:20,510
talents can now fit our needs for

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,670
example a surgeon has about integrins

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:26,720
translation time and bitcoin is much

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:30,440
longer of power 15 minutes and for Hyper

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,490
nature hyper rachel uses the trusty

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,460
communication channel which is now so

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,660
good for IOT systems it's because for

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:45,230
IOT suspenders the device needs to use a

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,450
contrast to communication channels it

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:53,140
it's in the perspective of our

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:56,150
technologies so maybe I can explain

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,900
things are you not helping

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,970
but tomorrow you ready sensation

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,760
tomorrow yeah have a session tomorrow

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,920
afternoon okay so it's the application

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,380
open source for sure

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,929
how's your open side no well that's for

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,150
sure not on your bitching okay so

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:19,610
we come to the next question so how are

00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:23,679
you using false with the technology so

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:26,000
how I mean I wouldn't trust any

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,700
blockchain implementation that is not

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,559
open source yeah because it's about

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,530
first of all trust and if you cannot

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,520
trust the source of it yeah why should I

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,410
trust the system then yeah so I think

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,840
always if I explain also blockchain

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,230
bringing together actually all of the

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,720
ideas existed before yeah but bringing

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,390
that together and this this this

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,830
completeness was was really ingenious

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:58,190
yeah and also I try to explain the

00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:01,510
people that it's not the technology you

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,640
just buy and do something with it and

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,920
tells some supplier you do like this

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,160
it's a technology you have to embrace

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,510
because it in many ways may change also

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,050
your business model yeah

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,580
and if you don't understand your

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,790
business model you're basically

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,250
yeah so you should yeah you should

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,690
embrace it in a different way but still

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,760
there will be applications where you

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,250
don't have to understand the technology

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:32,230
behind that because it won't affect your

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:34,960
business model so in a sense I mean I

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,830
see open-source is the very very basic

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,140
foundation for doing actually blockchain

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:46,990
but not all applications on top of that

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:52,030
have to be like then open but going back

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:54,760
to also solving some of the problems if

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,920
I think about a lot of ideas that are

00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,160
currently evolving around solving

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,470
identity problems I haven't seen the

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,340
killer application yet because I always

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:08,830
think there's I even coin at the

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,050
identity crisis so because the question

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:15,610
is how do you can how can really trust

00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:18,310
that you are you and I'm I'm yeah and if

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:21,720
we do transactions nevertheless

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:25,420
some some transaction I give you my

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,390
house yeah or I give you money and you

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,160
lose your private key for something yeah

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,010
who has the right to give it back yeah

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,490
and whose - right or is it the community

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,280
or however you may call it yeah and if a

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,740
device and IOT device or some

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,900
information in the blockchain how can

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,000
you really be sure that this IOT devices

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,090
really this IOT device and not to get

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,830
the communication has been tampered with

00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:56,500
even if the if the code or like a

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,440
private key is embodied into the CPU

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:04,810
with respect to n Delta and we know that

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,000
you might even attack those so um yeah I

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,130
think that is one of the the core

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,170
problems too

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean I think in general I'm not a

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:24,810
critic in general I'm not and positively

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:26,880
but not overly enthusiastic okay so I

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:30,420
don't want to object but I I want to I

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,110
want to kind of point out that a lot of

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,490
the identification privacy-related like

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,500
any place where you see a big

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,520
institution via government bank whatever

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,260
the other day there was a very

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,240
interesting paper by Accenture that said

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:49,340
that there's something called a mutable

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:52,140
blockchain go look it up I mean anyway

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,800
where I'm coming from is to say that we

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:59,730
the way this narrative is going on both

00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,960
in the cripton arcus world and in the

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,420
rest of the world which is trying to

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,970
make sense of all this stuff is that

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,800
everybody's anonymous and everybody you

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,270
know transacts privately and so on and

00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,980
so forth we we live in the real world

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,900
with real relationships where you know

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,730
it's the physical person is much much

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:20,040
more vulnerable you know then people

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,990
sitting you know behind terminals

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,220
imagine they are you know computers I

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,900
mean geeks have a sense of

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,340
invulnerability sometimes when you sit

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,930
behind black and white terminal you know

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,270
you can get control of who whatever

00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,460
right but that's not the case we're

00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,050
really vulnerable and we live in social

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,850
networks that are really strong and had

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,830
serious consequences would be you know

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,870
how its set it up so again just to come

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,630
back to the point where I feel like

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,430
we're really marching into a rat trap if

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,730
we're going to put all our stuff out on

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:50,240
a public ledger actually in in the

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:53,010
blockchain space the most sane

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,830
technology that I've seen is Zuko's Z

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,300
cash I believe it's called zero

00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,670
knowledge sorry zero knowledge proof

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,150
that's that's it cash is that cash yeah

00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,220
that's that's in my opinion that's the

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,620
sort of best oh it's also the thing we

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,810
often argue about yeah if people tell me

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,310
we have to store this and this on the

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,610
blockchain and it's like okay let's

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,970
let's think about that yeah if we for

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,039
instance put prices of bananas on

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,650
not chained it might be okay and now we

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,039
have cryptography that at least hides it

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,419
for the next few years and then at some

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,150
points we might have cryptography that

00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,760
unveils the prices of bananas maybe

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,260
forty years ago that might be okay

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,720
because nobody cares then about the

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,870
price of bananas at that time but if you

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,640
put your health records on it yeah we

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,380
shouldn't do that we should be very

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,130
scarce with this kind of information

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,049
putting it in an immutable thing we

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:53,090
might also think twice about putting

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:56,299
financial transactions on it might yeah

00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:00,380
but might not be so sensitive than like

00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:07,039
real information about you very personal

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:09,350
things this is a sort of observation for

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,470
those who have perhaps that the the

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,179
crook of anarchist mindset and I think

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,770
in Hawaii we have oh here a monetary

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,900
system which is anonymous well no we

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,289
don't we have a monetary system which

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,909
has a perfect indelible public record of

00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:24,890
every single transaction that's happened

00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:26,210
when Bitcoin give Bitcoin gets big

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,919
enough to be used for significant

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,789
financial crimes then prosecutors are

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,470
going to invest

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,690
what are they have to to perform

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,610
ordinary anti money laundering but with

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,679
the aid of a perfect record of every

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,650
transaction that's ever occurred it's a

00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:44,470
slam dunk

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:48,049
okay so next question Thank You Robin I

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,760
continue with talking about false how

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:52,400
there is the open source ecosystem

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:58,580
benefit from the train to the blockchain

00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:02,990
technology I think in many ways open

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:07,460
source movement now benefits from the

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:09,950
hype because I mean if I think about

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,990
enterprises their people start to

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,409
understand that this is a thing that you

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:17,059
just cannot really buy and go and maybe

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,549
you have a supplier that you can do but

00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,160
I mean if it's not really open then you

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,080
are you

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,250
we missing the point and a lot of people

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,670
won't try to be partner yeah and if you

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,260
have to partner and have to - again it's

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,700
about the trust thing and if you can

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,610
have to establish trust between

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,950
partnerships and you have to use the

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,900
software and it's open-source then for

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,030
the I think for the very first time a

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:51,840
lot of people will actually think about

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:54,270
this kind of technology I again this is

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:59,160
more an intuition than a very concrete

00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:00,450
view but the fact that this present a

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,460
lot of blockchain based applications

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,400
default open and we do use a hyper

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,010
ledger that our inside closed networks

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,130
but a lot of the interest is in

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,290
applications which our default open with

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,050
respect to the content of the the

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:19,080
distributed ledger that happens to be

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:22,290
the same behavior that open source of

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,290
free software developers exhibit so at a

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,610
very high level it is my intuition that

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,440
there's there will be situations where

00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,330
the fact those two things go together

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,760
mean that we well aligned there'll be

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,820
things that open-source communities can

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,770
use block chains for that closed

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,590
communities might have trouble so I

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:43,920
suspect a synergy but I don't have

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,870
concrete examples yet and by the way

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,990
thank you very much believe the emitter

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:52,070
care for me it's my think why comic it

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:55,290
is for me to do to go to the pendulous

00:27:52,070 --> 00:28:00,300
actually I said sit on what is it honest

00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:03,350
I will thank you very much Jerry I you

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:07,130
have anything to add on the user of

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:11,280
fourth and opens or ecosystem benefited

00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:14,850
to two things broadly I think I think I

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:20,100
do agree with that

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:23,340
this whole Bitcoin publicity has really

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,360
brought the idea of the

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:33,120
sort of open-source a geek if you like

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:34,920
to be a bit more sexy so so I think

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,670
that's that's that's good in many ways

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,550
and not taking any gender positions here

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,290
but I think that's really nice because

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,210
I've actually been a road warrior to

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,790
take free and open source software about

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,380
a decade ago in my home state of Kerala

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,650
and I walked a thousand four hundred

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,500
kilometres over 40 days just to talk to

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,590
schoolchildren about Foss and a lot of

00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,610
the conversations that came up was about

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,950
how do you make money out of this how do

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:05,720
I get a job you know these are very

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:09,600
fundamental questions you know in in the

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,970
not first world that you know it's about

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,850
food and surviving and so from that

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,300
respects but I feel like if more and

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,680
more people are somehow by accident

00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,630
drawn into Foss

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,050
just because of the publicity of the

00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,790
blockchain and Bitcoin and so on that

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,410
might be a really good thing but I want

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:32,700
to help HP out a little bit here with

00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:36,090
the good parts I was at a conference

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,820
last year where a room full of really

00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:42,330
public bureaucrats in India we we in

00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,520
India worm from we have this new

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,490
identity scheme called art art which I

00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,770
will not talk about right now but anyway

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,580
in that context there was somebody who

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,860
showed up from somewhere in Latin

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,350
America I do not want to say the wrong

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,680
country but anyway they were looking as

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:04,860
a government at using the blockchain to

00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,450
implement contracts so they they they

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:12,300
were they were looking as a government

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:14,130
to implement I'm not sure what the what

00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,360
the mining scheme was or who was or what

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,770
blockchain particularly they were

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,940
interested in but as a government

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,980
because the person who spoke was a

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,170
bureaucrat and he understood contracts

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,840
and the government position on contracts

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,670
and sort of you know there's a whole

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,650
bunch of issues legal and legislative

00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,210
and so on and so forth and that

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,590
conversation seemed quite interesting

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,650
because for the first time actually saw

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,520
somebody who was a bureaucrat

00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:40,220
who was in government not necessarily

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,970
dealing with technology you know from

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,460
our practitioners point of view actually

00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:49,220
talking about using this technology at

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:52,220
scale at the scale of entire country and

00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,360
I'm not sure what positions take on that

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,940
but I felt like that was a really

00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,230
positive thing what was the intended use

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,790
was this for all government contracts

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,370
all contracts a change in kottakkal to

00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,640
require at all I believe they were

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:10,820
looking at the the implementation or

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,950
digitization of the function of what in

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,980
India is called a registrar so the

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:20,300
government's would sort of it's sort of

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,760
you know credibility so I'm the

00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,650
government and I vouch for the fact that

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,300
this contract was signed so the

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,820
equivalent they wanted to automated

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,920
using blockchain so then the costs and

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,360
so on work in a canal this hasn't been

00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,900
treating history and it was unaware of

00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,310
their use certainly in sort of the

00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,030
ancient world man I'm thinking ancient

00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:43,490
Athens a contract was unenforceable

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,530
unless it had been witnessed and

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,840
possibly even archived by a public

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:50,240
notary there was the concept of fiber

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,710
contracts that were secret was invalid

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,410
you could not go in front of it in the

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,210
court which is basically jury and demand

00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,790
enforcement the contract that had not be

00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,260
baited so we do an agent for land titles

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:03,280
and births and deaths and and to handle

00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:06,560
other things but this is for all of it I

00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,020
think in public space is also something

00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:12,980
they could read registry you know if you

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:15,770
have for instance a housing and

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:19,850
and you buy a house it usually just by

00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:22,460
putting yeah your name put like the

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,260
other name strikethrough and you you you

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,080
by your name putting on the on the

00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,330
public something registry yeah something

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,429
like this could also be a public

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,380
application of this kind of thing these

00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:35,540
are really compelling if you've got so

00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,340
Indonesia how the problem with haze has

00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,309
been that there are three overlapping

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,870
and inconsistent property Glen title

00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,880
systems in use Indonesia it's a part of

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,260
the difficulty several years ago when

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,710
the haze got a bit big sighting in

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:52,160
dispel of the world but the burning of

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:54,410
people possible to plant turned to sky

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,280
in this city but make you couldn't see

00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:02,450
20 meters yeah they don't have a

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,650
consistent state Ryland lentile registry

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,610
in fact they have up to three

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,830
overlapping ones and they're not

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,630
consistent the other issue you have in

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,870
some places I don't know is true

00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:14,059
Indonesia but it's a P the place what is

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:18,169
nice is you've got corrupt officials who

00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:20,240
are manipulating the registration

00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:22,580
transactions either to in public benefit

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,080
concerns from a transaction or notice of

00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,760
a bribe not to and so these cases yeah I

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,929
public indelible record of a public

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,120
transaction which is what a land

00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:34,760
transaction is it seems like a really

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,960
compelling application but that was the

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,740
question my mind was if you cut the

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,510
costs of contract registration there may

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,630
in fact be arguments for increasing the

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:48,890
scope of the public registration of of

00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:51,740
contracts with critical events so I it's

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,450
it's people leave it out there are one

00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,460
Li just comes up in in context or his

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,140
questions of contract formation does

00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,490
this conduct exist one party says yes

00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,780
one place there's no one notices this

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,960
was a document one notice this was the

00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,000
document that brings been tampered with

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,350
if you sort of eliminates that entire

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,580
kateri of disputes you cut the cost of

00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:14,480
entering into negotiating and

00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,950
enforcement contracts that has of course

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,419
leads to the question of who's going to

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,100
run the mining servers is it gonna be

00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,730
the government themselves monopolizing

00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,740
ludicrous

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,379
what kind of consensus mechanism are you

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,119
employing in the blockchain yes so it

00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:29,480
doesn't have to be proof of work which

00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,159
is also one of the myth that everything

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,510
is proof of work and you're just burning

00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,310
energy yeah the question is what kind of

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,700
consensus mechanism I mean proof of work

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:43,820
at the moment it's the the best proven

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,649
one yeah and there's the most consensus

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,919
about this consensus mechanism maybe

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:51,530
yeah but the question is are there

00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:55,399
others and if there are others and there

00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:57,290
are others yeah but if are those also as

00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:59,089
trustable as proof of work at the moment

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:03,609
we don't know and we will have to

00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:07,160
research a lot but I think there will be

00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:09,280
difference I mean sort whose has proof

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,020
of elapsed time and now they have like

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,710
mechanism where you can just exchange

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,930
the consensus mechanism but I think

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,390
there might be others as well yeah and I

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:24,020
mean if you talk to governments proof of

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:26,990
authority I am the one you know I at

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,540
least some of the ones decided that this

00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:32,150
is okay then this is okay this could

00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,880
also be one of the applications of the

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,319
different conscious making I'd point out

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,670
of a concrete example that already

00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:40,910
exists and is already having major

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:43,910
economic consequences and deaths Tillis

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:47,150
give you transparency so almost every

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,310
browser web browser abuse reports the

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:54,650
TLS certificate or the SSL certificates

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:58,609
that it encounters to observatory's logs

00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:01,160
three or four running what it does is

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:04,010
means that CAS will misbehave you've get

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,329
caught immediately like within seconds

00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:11,450
of the first misuse this takes away a

00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:13,040
whole category of abuse by CAS and in

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,810
fact it has also caused semantics to

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,750
have to exit the market because they

00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:20,060
were caught twice issuing fake Google

00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,099
certificates apparently for legitimate

00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,420
testing purposes not for criminal

00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,230
purposes but like it shouldn't have

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,339
happened once and it definitely

00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,780
shouldn't happen twice so that there are

00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:31,480
other mechanisms already news in the

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,190
world today that are not

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,130
centralize that are not government

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,559
controlled but have some of the same

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,750
character that make it infeasible for

00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,270
certain kinds of either erroneous or

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,000
corrupt behavior to go undetected and

00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:48,579
and this kind of of mechanism which is

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,710
lying behind that you can also use for

00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:52,180
different things I mean there was as one

00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:55,210
project which is called ever ledger

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,730
which is basically about tracing

00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:03,250
diamonds yeah so which is a high

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:08,040
vailable bailable a good and usually you

00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:11,740
buy diamonds in which countries yeah and

00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,559
they are usually created or at least

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,200
extracted from the soil in in quite poor

00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,960
countries yeah and so there's a problem

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,329
if you go for exploitation and to

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,210
actually prove that this diamond has not

00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:27,549
been it's not a Blood Diamond actually

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,710
yeah and one of the reason you can do it

00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:33,760
because it's first of all diamonds

00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,440
always have like a DNA yeah so can you

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,299
pretty we prove this time in this kind

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,730
of this diamond and we can prove it on

00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:42,369
the if you have like a provenance letter

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,160
behind that then you can try to find out

00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:47,349
and if some of the players are not good

00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,630
playing good then others can distrust

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:54,809
them yeah this kind of the web of trust

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:57,579
idea inverted so it's web of distrust to

00:37:54,809 --> 00:38:00,760
to this extent that you can record it

00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:03,460
publically which is like then something

00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:07,780
where you can say okay this this guy has

00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:09,700
appealed enough at least ideas that this

00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:13,839
guy is doing bad so I will go and check

00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:15,930
yeah and you could use or this

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,760
technology could use also for other I

00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:22,660
don't know cobalt for instance is one of

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,900
the things then or other rare earth

00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:30,790
materials that are usually coming from

00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:33,530
Africa or from China yeah lithium

00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,770
something else

00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:38,660
if you think about sourcing and

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,910
exploitation and you don't want to

00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,100
explore it but we want to have the right

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:45,530
sources but you have to prove it yeah or

00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,160
else there will be somebody in the

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:52,700
middle who will might counterfeit the

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:55,970
sourcing information yeah and this could

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,550
also be an application for instance yes

00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:02,330
so I would like to continue with the

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:05,030
point about the cons of blockchain now

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,830
so we we were talking in the conference

00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,200
that we're doing open technologies to

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:11,090
improve people's life and to make the

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,860
world's a better place it's always come

00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:17,780
up there questions of blockchain use it

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:19,820
a lot of energies and also so what what

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,280
should be the stake over socially

00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:25,280
responsible organization in regards to

00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,960
the question and before we we hear from

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,420
our panelists I would like to swell

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:41,390
myself with trolling they have all the

00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:44,990
panelists here together so again the

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:47,630
question is what should be the sake of

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,900
the socially responsible organization in

00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,430
regard to the question the cons of

00:39:50,900 --> 00:40:02,270
blockchain first of all the the

00:39:52,430 --> 00:40:04,100
engineering energy consumption you

00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,690
should care

00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,820
yes you should care I don't have an

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,040
answer for your question actually so the

00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,220
question again is what kind of consensus

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,930
mechanism is viable later on for not

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:21,210
solving CPU and heat intensive problems

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:25,430
but if you look at the the inspiration

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,540
behind you know the two-thirds majority

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,190
protocol the name for it is the

00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,110
Byzantine generals problem it's the

00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,940
warlike situation we know that's the god

00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:39,120
that's the social context in which this

00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:40,170
is this is coming out of this was a so

00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,670
the presenting generals problem is a

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,380
reference to military units from the

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,760
Byzantine Empire that were very loosely

00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,270
coupled that didn't trust each other

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,490
they tended to move towards a consistent

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,600
goal but at the field commanders didn't

00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,520
necessarily trust each other

00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,620
so if you're surrounding a city and you

00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,790
want to procedure it you need all the

00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,650
generals or most of the generals to

00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,720
attack simultaneously if one attacks by

00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:07,260
himself will get wiped out so how the

00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,430
generals agree how and when to attack it

00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,240
turns out to be prove it with the case

00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:15,390
that you need 3 M plus 1 2 thirds plus

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,550
one participant to agree if you have a

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:21,080
you can't make algorithm to work better

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:23,580
than that but yet whether you do that by

00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,890
burning CPU time or some other mechanism

00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:28,970
is that I think a really important

00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:31,170
question I think it's a terrible idea to

00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:36,930
build what amounts to a monetary system

00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:39,690
based upon intentional waste well

00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:43,550
slightly tangential but I mean I read an

00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:47,640
article recently about a bunch of crypto

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:50,580
millionaires who landed in Puerto Rico I

00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:54,810
believe it was the most bizarre was a

00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:57,180
physically to it away so I mean this is

00:41:54,810 --> 00:42:02,070
like a small group of very privileged

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:04,500
new millionaires who come together you

00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,810
know to celebrate or to look at

00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,390
opportunity to use crypto

00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:13,620
see in a not necessarily economically

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:15,270
advanced social context and the Crimea

00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,620
there they're asking at the exact

00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,520
question that we're asking here in this

00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:26,630
panel what can we use the blockchain for

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:29,520
to improve whose lives so I think yeah

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:34,350
it will do them a problem because every

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,910
decision-making mechanism is biased by

00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,130
who's making the decision and then and

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,690
the process whether or not it's a

00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,850
technical consensus mechanism in a in a

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,290
distributed ledger of lockdown

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,570
transactions or whether it's a political

00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,780
process or whatever it is that same

00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:51,590
organ rises and so yes we have this

00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,460
interesting perhaps slightly unseemly

00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,530
situation where a bunch of guys who are

00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,680
not particularly sophisticated on how

00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:00,000
societies work and politics and history

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,310
suddenly find themselves immensely

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,140
wealthy and sort of building what

00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,100
amounts the goats don't for those who've

00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,710
ever in Atlas Shrugged

00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,190
is sort of opting out society because

00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:14,460
they can and then trying to think what

00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,900
to do next with no grounding in him how

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:21,390
institutions work it's interesting

00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:27,080
problems so okay so but half the

00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:29,490
audience has some and so for us we have

00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,900
the remaining seven minutes I would like

00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,910
to open the floor to the audience the

00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,880
race question to our panelists and if

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:40,800
you have any

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:43,080
thank you together so hello so I'm a

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,060
museum from Wipro and I'll be talking

00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,430
mostly about the same subject tomorrow

00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,010
but I the discussion about the energy

00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,690
consumption and and it actually refers

00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,060
to the energy consumption of the Bitcoin

00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:57,540
miners on the planet not all blockchains

00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,360
are vast energy consumers is it is a

00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,860
very interesting problem I while I don't

00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,660
have an answer to this problem

00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,060
I have some elements that you want to

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,330
think about first of all it is extremely

00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,470
hard to store electricity efficiently so

00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:13,110
when you're producing too much

00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:15,510
electricity in some places it goes to

00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:17,430
waste anyway so why not use it that's

00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,020
the first thing the second thing is and

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,010
that's from talking from energy

00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,330
producers

00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:25,740
like my colleagues at energy in Germany

00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,780
we are going towards a world where we

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,510
will be able to use energy from the Sun

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,090
from the wind from the waves and we

00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,730
should be at some point able to produce

00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:38,609
more electricity that we will ever need

00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,320
for the whole planet this means that the

00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:43,470
problem of overconsumption of

00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,630
electricity by anything is only a

00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,910
temporary problem it's a lousy problem

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,380
to have it's a horrible one but it's a

00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:53,280
temporary problem because at some point

00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:55,710
it will not be a problem anymore so the

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,630
point is not to say we should turn

00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,100
Bitcoin into a non energy consuming

00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,359
environment or we should get rid of

00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,780
Bitcoin and do something else

00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:05,190
the point is we need to move forward

00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,830
faster to a point where energy is not an

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:10,590
issue anymore and it becomes a a free

00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,150
for everybody commodity and some energy

00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,910
producers are going in that direction

00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,359
today but the thing is I mean if you

00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:20,369
look at how energy is produced today

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:23,160
then we have a vast problem I mean yeah

00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:25,920
that's that's and if we just increase

00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,290
the demand at the current times then the

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,700
the standard reaction will be either way

00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:36,020
we build more atomic reactors yeah or

00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:40,109
you just scale up burning off fossils

00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:42,780
and I would agree I mean Germany just

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:46,200
decided to go out of the atomic thing

00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:48,990
yeah and but still the other stone scale

00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,490
at the moment very well or you move the

00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:54,840
miners to places where there's a lot of

00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:57,720
Sun so I questioned both promises for

00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:00,810
what you're arguing the principle error

00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,060
is that the way my neck proof of waste

00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:06,359
based mining works is that it's

00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,310
self-handicapping so it autumn on

00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:10,200
10-minute intervals this is not pub that

00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,080
is how everything works on 10-minute

00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,910
intervals the handicapping factors that

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,060
are used in the network are rebalanced

00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:21,600
to ensure that it remains difficult to

00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:24,300
mint new coins that will automatically

00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,890
correct for all possible increases in

00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,510
electricity consumption up to several

00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:31,240
orders of magnitude more than you met a

00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:33,400
sunlight for in a planet so that so that

00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,960
the the idea that somehow we'll

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,040
eventually have electricity 2 to 2 meter

00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,820
of which by the way it's been announced

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,880
at least twice in the past doesn't

00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,050
address the problem with proof of waste

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,170
based systems that are so hard to get

00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,700
because they will always automatically

00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,140
we give themselves to consume all the

00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,339
avail electricity and take it away from

00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,390
other applications so that I don't

00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:57,310
dispute your broader claim about what

00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,300
solar energies and wind and you're

00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,070
getting cheaper and we'll keep getting

00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,839
cheaper but the idea that that is in any

00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,990
way capable of solving the problem is I

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,430
would suggest not correct because I end

00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,690
right and Bitcoin will have to stop

00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,640
having it at some point or it will end

00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:12,700
up making it so fun to be relevant did

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,520
this collapse a result wait the other

00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:18,760
half of it is that although energy

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,130
storage is relatively difficult we're

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,609
getting better at it

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:28,200
and really there are two major areas two

00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:30,040
or three one is various kinds of battery

00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,960
unfortunately most of lithium is in

00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,250
Venezuela so the kinds of places you're

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,930
gonna water make you the conflict

00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,339
diamond problem the principal place

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:40,660
you're gonna one not take with him from

00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:41,680
is where the lithium is so we have a bit

00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,830
of a problem on that front and we'll

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,990
have for some considerable time there

00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:50,950
are liquid sodium sort of you heat metal

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,410
during the day and then taking it out of

00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:55,300
it during the night pumped hydro schemes

00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,220
are starting to look like a major player

00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,660
so Australia's headway in place for

00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:03,940
decades South Australia went dark

00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:06,190
last year advanced country where an

00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:11,339
entire state the whole grid wind up

00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:13,450
stayed their way for hours because the

00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:15,640
wind and solar renewables have come

00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,990
online too quickly there's been a local

00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,940
drivers have been built to just say put

00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,580
more and more and more wind and solar

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,020
source without any obligation to provide

00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,400
frequency control and synchronization

00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,839
this is a technical argument about how

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,190
grids work but importantly the

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,050
politicians didn't understand it when

00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:31,180
they wrote the incentives and so you've

00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,890
now got some of the oldest knives

00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,300
nastiest cheapest and often the

00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,250
second-hand technology news in South

00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,230
Australia but providing more than a

00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,270
third of the grids power and that's a

00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,410
recipe for disaster and so the part of

00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,619
the solution to that problem is to get

00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,259
better at either batteries

00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,029
which Tesla has been done or punt hydro

00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:49,849
now it happens in South South Australia

00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:53,569
is physically the right shape to do punt

00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:54,890
hydro against the edge so we the the

00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:56,630
storage problem is one that we've had

00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:00,319
the luxury of overlooking because we've

00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:05,420
used heavy spinning turbine based now

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:10,249
stations with a hydro or the burning

00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:11,900
hydrocarbons we're having to rethink

00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:14,749
that as we step into wind and solar

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,819
based systems and so on the two fronts

00:49:14,749 --> 00:49:18,410
one having those systems take

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,960
responsibility for frequency control and

00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:22,849
stability as part of the business of

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,039
selling power to quit and the other

00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:26,749
getting better its storage both of those

00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,690
will advance and will advance fairly

00:49:26,749 --> 00:49:31,309
quickly over the next decade so I I

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,900
don't dispute your broader point about

00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,999
we are gonna have a whole lot more power

00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,729
available by solar and wind means but

00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:39,079
the Don the two bits how that fits this

00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:44,180
problem I think it'll resolve a

00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:45,619
different way yep so South Australia

00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,809
isn't quite the shape of Switzerland but

00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:50,329
we think this there are enough Hills in

00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:52,400
the ocean to do it so yes thank you very

00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:54,789
much I think we have temple only one

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,789
more question

00:49:56,529 --> 00:50:00,619
excellent

00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:03,680
first of all things for your insight so

00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:06,289
looking now to blockchain basically ten

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:10,219
years like technology available yeah

00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:14,630
what would be your hypothesis why this

00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:18,369
thing didn't made it so far to final

00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:21,739
application for example in corporates I

00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:24,589
mean in one sentence corporates the

00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:28,999
technology is quite new and from the

00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:31,789
idea it came up it has not been

00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:34,489
developed so far for corporates enough

00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:38,059
yeah because usually a lot of business

00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:40,190
models are clinging to hiding kind of

00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:42,289
information from one party to another

00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:45,020
party and that is your competitive

00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:47,990
advantage and so an

00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:51,260
the real idea in the beginning was

00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:56,180
everything is transparent so this is one

00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:57,740
of the major things and technology does

00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,750
I mean having technology

00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:02,680
enterprise-ready is something different

00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:07,940
than having it just run somewhere

00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:09,800
blockchains on oh yeah just a quick one

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,510
about the gap between theory and

00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,210
practice and the scientific method that

00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:19,700
actually narrows the two so hopefully

00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:24,350
there's the room for improvement it's

00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:27,350
good for IOT in terms of the costs it's

00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:31,250
because in some areas that penguins is

00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:34,460
very expensive if we use the central

00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:39,700
model such possible corral servers so we

00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:46,160
use a peer-to-peer model to reduce cost

00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:50,500
without any central parties such as the

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:56,350
corral server is much expensive and

00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,350
total amount of sovereigns device

00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:01,790
blockchain transactions on distributed

00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,030
hypotheses are fundamentally new

00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:07,210
primitive ten years is a very very short

00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:10,790
period of time I would argue that the

00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:12,260
progress is not slow it's fast I can't

00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,630
think of an example but you don't know

00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:19,640
this will take 30 or 40 years so I think

00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:22,640
it's quickly okay so I think we come to

00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,890
the end of our panel the final question

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,560
for the panelists you don't have to

00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:32,030
insert an open question and also for the

00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:33,380
audience so what came blockchain really

00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,510
helped us at the world

00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,820
what could prob lems the flushing

00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:39,500
conserve and if you are a developer

00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,980
you're working or currently working on

00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:45,140
any open sort of application that useful

00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,910
for the world that's using blossom

00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,590
leaves we would like to hear more from

00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:52,070
you so the panelists we

00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:54,140
ow until Sunday you are welcome to

00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:56,720
comment or turn to them at the end of

00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:59,070
the panel now let's keep our applause

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:07,540
for our panelists thank you very much

00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:07,540
