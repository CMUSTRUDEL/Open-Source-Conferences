good afternoon everyone thank you this

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,040
is a talk on the Google assistant

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,040
actually I didn't properly think through

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,410
when I was giving the proposal for the

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,089
talk the talk title should I have

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,550
actually been building conversational

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,320
experiences with actions on Google but

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,060
since most of you do not know what

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,730
actions on Google is I thought I'll

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,670
simplify it by just saying overview of

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,130
the Google assistant anyway my name is

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,990
money I have a very long name it's so

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,090
hard that people in the immigration

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,399
offices basically struggle with my name

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,230
whenever I cross borders my name is

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,660
money I work in the Singapore developer

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,530
relations team I take care of all of our

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,850
developer outreach across Southeast Asia

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,809
so today I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,489
the actions on Google platform but

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,309
before I start talking I want to know

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,149
how many of you have actually seen

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,920
Google assistant in action raise your

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,050
hands please how many of you have seen

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,120
Google assistant in action okay how many

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,229
of you have heard of the word the Google

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,810
assistant all right okay through the

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,820
next 20 to 35 minutes what I'm going to

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,659
do is I'm going to talk to you introduce

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,189
the platform what the assistant can do

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,229
what are some of its capabilities and

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,150
how you as developers can build

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,670
applications and experiences on top of

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,830
it all right and just to introduce to

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:32,329
you the platform I'm going to play a

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,329

Planet dr. Cora show me my photos from

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,830
last weekend your car is parked at 22

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,450
feet today in the news

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,750

set a timer talk to headspace and then

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,990
just for a moment I'd like you to let go

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,540
of any focus at all just let your mind

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,360
do whatever it wants to do

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,920
don't do what good night turning off all

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,920
the things see you tomorrow

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:53,570
so what did we just see we saw a few

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:55,880
devices few actions provoked by uses few

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,850
apps came into the way like Netflix

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,190
let's basically separate the different

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,310
components that we are talking about

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:07,370
first we have the devices devices such

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,950
as the Google home if you carry an

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,320
Android phone or an iPhone again you can

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,680
access Google assistant on the phone you

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,880
have stereos you have four oops someone

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,180
spinning me

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,290
you have you have boomers devices that

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,770
can basically access the Google

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,600
assistant right and these devices we

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,880
just call them as surfaces because they

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,100
don't necessarily need to have the same

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,200
screens they don't need to have the same

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,290
kind of input methodologies that our

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,090
phones currently have the second piece

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,420
and the central piece that we are

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,420
interested today is the google assistant

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,280
right and the last piece is actions on

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,410
google actions on google is the

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,380
developer platform on which you can

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,540
build applications or services for the

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,520
google assistant please ignore me sorry

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,480
we use a lot of hangouts and people are

00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,540
likely sending me messages all right so

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,940
that's the Google assistant like I

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,570
shared with you on devices where you

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,489
have a keeper a keyboard or even just

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,739
touching capability such as your phone

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,170
the Google assistant can take that as an

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,930
input but in situations where such as

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,570
you have a Google home where the only

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,150
way of interaction is via voice Google

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,480
assistant can take that as well alright

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,520
so you have multiple input modalities it

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,070
is available on a breadth of hardware

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,950
all the way from headphone stereos such

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,740
as the Google earbuds that we launched

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,419
to the phones you it's available on

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,180
Chrome OS it's available on your

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:44,270
wearable devices so a numerous range of

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,610
devices estimated over 400 million are

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,130
able to run the Google assistant and

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,270
it's just not the plethora of devices

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,729
it's also available on a range of

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,860
languages and countries just two to

00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,860
three weeks back we announced what was

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,500
so anticipated

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,790
Southeast Asia developers support for ty

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,820
and bahasa indonesia right so so many

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,590
languages support the Google assistant

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,500
and apps built on it it's also supported

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,270
on several devices right so that is

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,180
pretty much the opportunity that you

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:22,200
have developing on the actions on Google

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,720
platform apart from the apart from this

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,570
a couple of things to note is what

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,070
Google also brings to you as developers

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,900
as features into the platform you have

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,080
you can understand who the user is where

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,270
Google identity you can actually perform

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,310
transactions you can have individual

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,780
speech recognition and all this is

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,710
available to you just like how you would

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,880
program on a regular phone device so

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,680
literally you can bring all the

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,470
experiences that you are providing to a

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,120
user on a mobile phone why a goggle

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,250
assistant which necessarily does not

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:03,750
have the same input modality and it's

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:07,050
just not earphones and phones just at

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:23,830
CES this year we made a big announcement

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:26,630
[Music]

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:36,440
hey Google good morning good morning

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:42,070
Rachel hey Google where is the first

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,170
appointment I'm gonna get there

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:50,050
you can see the full directions on your

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:51,960
phone hey Google what should I make for

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,210
dinner

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,270
show me the noodles recipe start cooking

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:03,790
great let's get started

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,790
[Music]

00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:12,610
hey Google show me photos of China

00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:19,410
here's what I found in your google

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:29,579
photos show me YouTube videos of pandas

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:29,579
[Music]

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:41,329
hey Google play my evening playlist

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,329
[Music]

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:52,220
hey Google call dad hey Dad hey Rachel

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:53,380
how's it going hey Google show me the

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,950
baby's room

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,390
[Music]

00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:11,100
tonight Google

00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:11,100
[Music]

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,189
the video can be quite attractive but I

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,080
think what we as developers need to

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,909
understand now is actually split the

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,680
entire video and try to understand the

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,409
different capabilities that the platform

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,490
offers to us so what did we see in that

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:31,770
video first we saw what is called

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,409
individual speech recognition when the

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,899
person said hey Google good morning it

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,820
said good morning Rachel and that is

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,459
because it was able to individually

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,790
understand who was talking to it right

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:48,690
and this is super important because

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,579
let's say I say called long right and my

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,110
wife says called mom both our moms are

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:54,990
different and it shouldn't trigger the

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,070
wrong person right so understanding the

00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,089
individual person is a capability

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,120
integration with Google services or

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:05,399
third-party solutions example is hey the

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,380
person has how far is this place from

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,660
here and it was immediately able to pull

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:13,589
the data from Google Maps and not only

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,600
that it was also able to send that piece

00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,660
of information back into the users phone

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,699
so I can take it with me as I travel

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,339
other thing hooks for smartphone devices

00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:26,220
such as the baby monitor control again

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,990
Google assistant is hooked to a range of

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,040
smart home devices including smart

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,300
things and other devices launched on

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,579
phone something we just spoke about

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,160
seeing the directions on phone so that

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,279
you can carry forward that information

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,380
after you leave wherever you are your

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,199
other thing ability to in work other

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,329
applications and continue that is again

00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:50,670
a break feature so that there is no

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:52,589
continuity that is lost between one

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,649
action to the other right

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:58,050
I've talked quite a bit but let me show

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,269
you some pieces of the code so that you

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,019
understand how to build applications and

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,350
services on the Google assistant alright

00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,829
cool

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:11,430
this is a high-level block diagram of

00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:12,290
how any service on the Google assistant

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,779
is built

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,510
okay let's basically walk through left

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,750
to right from the left user basically

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,649
says and I'm going to take an example of

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,180
let's

00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:30,930
a supermarket right here you are as a

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,300
user trying to make a purchase into

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,399
let's say something like fat price

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,589
online I'm just giving fictitious

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,800
examples here you're basically saying

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:43,589
first is what you do called invocation

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,779
you invoke the service coming from a

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,179
mobile context this is equivalent of

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,199
tapping the apps button on the home

00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,410
screen okay

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:55,499
you basically say hey Google let me

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,939
speak to fair price online right and in

00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:59,220
fair price online behind the scenes

00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:01,920
basically registers their app to this

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,709
invocation service or or this set of

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,540
words fair price online what the Google

00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:09,240
assistant does is basically matches

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,610
these two and then connects it over to

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,420
the assistant app and someone like fair

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,929
price online has built and then the

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,699
second immediate thing that an app is

00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:23,879
supposed to do is basically say hello

00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:26,550
and fat race online I can help you with

00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,209
orders groceries etc right so it's a

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,870
welcome message

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:33,420
so that's part two action response right

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,540
and then comes the next piece which is

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,329
user request and then I can say hey send

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:43,379
me two kilos of mangoes to my house

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:45,689
right and then separates online needs to

00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,240
process that input and then generate

00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:52,559
output and this is the entire cycle of a

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,990
conversation here is another fictitious

00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,559
example this is not called personal chef

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,829
right who basically recommends recipes

00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,740
based on the food that I have based on

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:07,829
whatever my mood is at that time and if

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,749
you see left to right again first thing

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:14,429
that the user does is basically speaks

00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:17,429
to a Google home or Android device iOS

00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:19,829
device whatever it is and important

00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:24,600
thing to note is that these devices do

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:26,850
not process this data it is carried over

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,799
directly to the Google assistant and it

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,079
is the Google assistant who basically

00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,899
has the intelligence he basically

00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,950
converts the speech into text

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,920
Hiba

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,050
has high-level NLP capabilities he

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,660
understands who the user is and he

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:46,650
brings in this layer of functionality

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,140
right and then he says ok you're asking

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,490
for personal chef let me see if there's

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,800
someone called personal chef that I know

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,110
of right and he looks through the entire

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,090
directory listing and then says ok I

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,890
know this guy he's the app called

00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:02,700
personal chef let me hand him over to

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:05,790
you so that's what it says sure he is

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,830
personal chef and then comes personal

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,620
chef with his hello or introductory

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,170
message wases hey what are the mold what

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,720
is the mode in which here and today so

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:19,290
that's the introduction the passing over

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,570
of a conversation then after that the

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,660
conversation directly flows between the

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,550
end users application and the user right

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,190
so you basically ask a question like

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,910
well it's kind of cold outside so I'd

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,940
like ABC and again you need to do some

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,510
switched speech-to-text parts and then

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,850
give a response but here is the enormous

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:45,210
amount of complexity doing

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,280
speech-to-text parsing words here is a

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,890
simple example that I can give you is a

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,670
very complex task look at the first

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:56,760
example let's read it well it's kind of

00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,510
cold outside so like something to warm

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:04,800
me up like a hot soup and I want it fast

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:07,230
right out of all these 15 18 20 words

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,020
that the user has uttered ultimately

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,700
what matters is that the user wants a

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:16,920
soup a hot soup and he wants it fast

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,500
right everything else is basically just

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,990
the natural way of conversation and you

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,760
want some intelligence to learn to

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,920
basically strip out the unnecessary

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,230
words and actually capture the important

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,810
words and you know why this is complex

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,790
if you just look at this one statement

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,260
there are three words that appear which

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,810
are very common flick ting one is hot

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,110
then there is warm and then there is

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,640
cold right and it is very easy if I just

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,730
do

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,190
in a simple grep that I will actually

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,890
look for all these three words and the

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,360
soup can basically go look one right and

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,790
that is a horrible experience

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,980
you want some intelligence to identify

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:02,720
that the user wants to have a hot soup

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:05,510
and again here is the case let's say the

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,540
next part of the conversation is I have

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,480
some hot chicken and I have some chicken

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,070
and also has some canned tomatoes here

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,990
he is talking about two different things

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,900
he's talking about Tomatoes he's talking

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,180
about chicken both are essential to the

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,890
soup but one of them is a protein one of

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,230
them is the main the other is more of a

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,900
flavor right so we want to understand

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:31,120
which plays a bigger role and it's

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:33,320
inherently complex task and that's why

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,320
Google acquired a company called

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,060
dialogue flow it's a new name but

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,760
actually the original company's name was

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,970
called API dot AI this has anyone heard

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:46,670
of this API dot a few hands that's nice

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,950
API dot a is a company that Google

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,800
acquired I think roughly 15 18 20 months

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,880
back and just three to five months back

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,700
the name has changed to dialogue flow

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,210
dataflow does two things very well one

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,130
is called intent magic what is intent

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,610
matching when the user says something

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:10,670
you need to identify what action the

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:15,830
user is trying to perform that is intent

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,800
matching second is entity extraction is

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,870
what I was talking to you about

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,240
identifying the tomatoes the chicken the

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,730
different items in that sentence and

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,470
understanding what it stands for is

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,220
again a complex task

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,560
so entity extraction and also in Ted

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:37,910
magic or two things done very well by

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,550
the dialogue flow product right so let's

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:44,180
look at the entire flow again with

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:46,280
dialogue flow into picture so the first

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,940
half of the entire conversation remains

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,130
the same it's only the second part that

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:56,800
you can actually delegate the task of

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,750
doing NLP intent matching and extraction

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,980
over to dialogue flow and then you

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,750
connect it back to your vacuum okay and

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:28,030
I'm going to show you how all this is

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:30,980
done in a product all right okay so can

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,470
everyone see my screen well

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,410
people in the back yeah okay right so

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,510
this is how a project ended up slow

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,370
looks like there are a lot of

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,650
terminology but let's basically go

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,140
through some of the basics here whatever

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,360
is shown en basically says the number of

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,820
languages that this bought basically

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,299
supports currently it's English but I

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,510
can actually add more languages let's go

00:17:53,299 --> 00:18:01,549
to what is called intents like it said

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:05,299
intent is whatever so whatever action

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:07,340
the user will want to do is an intent in

00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:10,460
Engineers terms whatever features you

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:14,120
want to expose right again going back to

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:17,540
the same grocery example what you want

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,760
to expose are features like shopping

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,400
cart adding items to it removing items

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,400
from it checking the price all those are

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,260
features and then what would the

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,679
end-user want to do he would want to add

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:33,290
items to the cart those things right so

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,280
all that is present in what is called

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:40,460
entities my chat bot does one thing it

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,580
basically gives me back a birthday

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:47,360
reminder right so when I ask him hey

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:50,059
when was Paul born when was when did

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,130
Mark get married things like that then

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:55,160
it's going to give me a date that's all

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,580
very simple right and within dialog

00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,830
though there is also a way to test this

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:10,730
so again live demo let's see how well

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:13,549
this works when was Sam bond so it says

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,919
Sam's birthday is on July the 4th right

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:18,740
so essentially what happened is it went

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,080
behind the scenes look the hit my back

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,700
in database there's not a back in

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,549
database but it's actually hard-coded

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,380
it's it's coming from a back-end server

00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:31,790
and it's basically giving me back a

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,320
response so what happened here computer

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,270
basically understood not Dynaflow

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,049
understood that I'm actually looking for

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:41,929
a person's name called Sam and what is

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,890
called an occasion ok in my situation

00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:48,890
these

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:51,050
occasions are called entities right what

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,360
am I trying to remember it's an occasion

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,970
and I have defined two types of

00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,200
occasions one is birthday the other is

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:03,050
anniversary okay and I also have the

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,480
ability to define synonyms for some of

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:09,200
these words because sometimes we

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,960
basically say hey by add two cans of

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,160
coca-cola sometimes we say bye get two

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,110
cans of coke right coca-cola and cook we

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,690
know are the same thing computer does

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,430
not know it's the same thing so again we

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,590
have the ability to define what is

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,600
called synonyms some people call it

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,240
wedding day from where I come in India

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,780
we don't say anniversary we say wedding

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:40,130
day so again you have the ability to

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:43,940
define this so if I basically say when

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:47,390
is Marc's wedding anniversary again it's

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:51,770
going to say Marc's anniversary is July

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:55,240
the fourth and the way this is happening

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:58,790
is let me show you pieces of the code

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:03,040
whenever a Venn query is triggered right

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,040
whenever a Venn query is triggered

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,880
system basically looks and I am

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,800
basically giving it some training

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,990
phrases saying okay this is how roughly

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,390
a question was will appear when it was

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,760
David born when was so-and-so born

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,800
what is his birthday when is his wedding

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,480
day so these are different phrases in

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,090
which the same question can be triggered

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,650
and it also uses machine learning so

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,300
that you don't have to define all the

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,630
different cases in which something make

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:33,260
this can be pronounced and then I am

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:36,530
saying for me to respond to this request

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:39,760
I need two things one is a name

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:45,620
the other is I need to know the action

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:48,070
so if I basically now ask what is the

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,070
birthday

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,290
it's now asking me whose name did you

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,240
say because I did not mention any names

00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:59,150
right and I can solve this problem in

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,180
two different ways one is why what is

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,950
called mentioning a prompt which is from

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:08,170
where this is coming from whose name did

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:12,250
you say or you have something called as

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:14,810
context which basically remembers who

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:18,040
what was the subject of the previous

00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:22,970
question so let's say I basically ask

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:25,340
hey buy me two kilos of mangoes and then

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,680
next question is what is the price of it

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,780
then it already understands that I'm

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,470
talking about two kilos of mangoes so

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:37,640
there is continuity in the conversation

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:40,250
it so the last piece or perhaps the most

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,000
important piece is connecting it to a

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,490
back end and this is called fulfilment

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,720
fulfilling the users request with data

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,870
like you said dialogue flow does NLP

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,370
well does understand the query well but

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,670
it does not have the intelligence to

00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,080
basically serve an answer for that you

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,360
have the ability to connect it to a

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,890
back-end service right that back in

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,020
service can be anywhere it can basically

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,390
be running on a kubernetes engine it can

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,370
basically be sitting in your own happy

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:14,630
machine it can be anywhere

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:18,020
I have hosted my service here in this

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:29,240
URL and I have a very small tiny piece

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:32,150
of code and this is exactly what is

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,180
going inside my code yon previously was

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,010
just talking about if AAS or functions

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,850
as a service this is a function as a

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,850
service I posted it on firebase backend

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,580
it's a very simple web hook waiting for

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,890
a request in a particular format and

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,890
when that appears all it does is

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,350
basically finds a given name then puts

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,940
it into a concatenated string and always

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,030
says anybody's birthday according to

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,910
this is on July the 4th okay so that's

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,800
exactly what that code does

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,140
obviously you can extend this by

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,450
connecting it to back in database doing

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:11,980
a lookup and then basically responding

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:15,700
to the users request so that is how easy

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:17,890
fulfilling a request is easiest way to

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,140
remember let's say you have a mobile API

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,450
back-end you already have the API

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,910
back-end just connect that one to this

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:30,990
one and then they both can talk to each

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:33,370
other very comfortably so so that is

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,620
dialogue flow the product that I wanted

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,660
to share with you there are also things

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,660
like analytics so that you know how many

00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,580
requests are flowing in where are they

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,760
going - what time etcetera how

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:48,810
frequently the other thing that you

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,850
should actually know is integrations

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:54,820
data flow as a product from Google does

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:58,240
not mean that you are again confined to

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:02,110
the Google environment of assistance you

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,960
can publish your chat bot or your

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,900
assistant to facebook Messenger slack or

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,770
the numerous other services because it's

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,170
hooked to all of them behind the scenes

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:16,360
right and what I'm going to do is

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,330
actually going to do a quick demo of

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,770
this I can basically just do see how it

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,360
works in the Google assistant I can

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,040
click this and it will create a Google

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,720
assistant project but I have already

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,030
done this so I'm going to go into this

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,220
tab this is alright okay can everyone

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,500
see this that's nice alright so if you

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,720
look at this how many of you are

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:42,220
familiar with just an app mobile app

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,290
publishing an Android app okay few names

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,330
so just like how you have a lot of

00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,250
metadata you want to know what is the

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,990
targeting levels etcetera you have the

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,150
same capabilities on the actions on

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:54,520
Google so you basically can say okay

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,250
this is the different languages you can

00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,280
upload metadata such as images which I

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,270
haven't done this is how my apps will be

00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:07,110
invoked birthday reminder sample and I

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:11,299
can provide a lot of other details to it

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:15,929
I also have a simulator

00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:18,179
which in which I can also have a voice

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:21,149
only simulation or basically a mobile

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,299
like simulation let's see how this one

00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:23,299
works

00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:32,580
talk to birthday reminder sample your

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,239
here's the test version the birthday

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,700
reminder sample your day so it's

00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:42,779
reminding to responding to me good day

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,759
because I have caused the Google

00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:48,440
assistant and I have put it as a welcome

00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,619
intent to pick one of these phrases

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,529
hello

00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm birthday reminder hello good day

00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:57,899
greetings so it can respond in one of

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,809
these different variations and this time

00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:06,950
it has picked this up randomly so now

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:06,950
here I can use when was Martin born

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:14,909
again it's 14th birthday is on July 4 so

00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,190
the other thing that you should note is

00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:21,299
that there are two ways in which this

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:23,669
response is coming back one is more of

00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:25,919
audio and the other is a simple text

00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:33,600
birthday on July 1st and that is coming

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:37,379
from here it's not the request it's on

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,629
the response it's here so depending on

00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:41,789
the device or the surface on which the

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:45,210
request is being made you can have

00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:46,980
either speech input or just textual

00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:51,509
input or a combination of who these

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:54,980
things and that takes me into the last

00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:54,980
part of representation

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,030
and we have a node.js library and I

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,669
think we have libraries on other

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,549
platforms as well and this is how you

00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,760
would structure a back-end application

00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,100
right

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,400
you basically have incoming webhook

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,740
requests which I'm currently delegating

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:21,610
into this response handler I have the

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:25,120
ability to basically query requests this

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,830
is all common stuff but the even more

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,890
interesting stuff like I was talking to

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,470
you about is the ability to give what is

00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:35,799
called rich interactive media in the

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:38,290
same assistant interface so here is a

00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,020
question there is a lot but what you

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:44,470
have to note is you can also display

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,630
images you can have links these are

00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,510
called chips which are short buttons

00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:52,390
that are easy for you to invoke it all

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:55,600
this is available just to a simple API

00:28:52,390 --> 00:29:00,660
such as an basic card set image ad

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,919
suggestion ships etc the other most

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,040
unique thing that the Google assistant

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:08,440
offers is that it ensures that the users

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,950
responses or the computers responses

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,390
does not sound like a robot it's so

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,790
important that you give a human

00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:18,070
character to your application and that

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:22,240
people do not feel as if they are

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:24,700
talking to a computer so few design

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,280
guidelines as developers when you look

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,940
at this is you'll have to own what is

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,730
called the persona of the assistant just

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,820
like how in mobile apps you had branding

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,809
guidelines you had color schemes and all

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,740
these other things which were able to

00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:44,890
communicate the brand of your

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,380
application you'll have to own what is

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:51,010
called the persona of of the assistant

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,799
in this case and for that we have tools

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:56,470
one of them is a markup language that we

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,860
are providing so that you can have very

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,380
definitive utterances such as giving a

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:07,090
pause right or even saying some things

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,700
very uniquely such as WW or even playing

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,279
an audio

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,360
example or even breaking in terms of a

00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:16,490
conversation and just putting a bow boss

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,250
the other thing that you can do to

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,409
ensure that your users feel comfortable

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,230
interacting with an assistant is to have

00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:26,600
persistence every time user does not

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,659
want to feel alien when he is starting a

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,510
conversation right so always going back

00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:34,789
to a past conversation saying hey hello

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,279
welcome you back hey how is your last

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:40,159
order these kind of things still make a

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,090
human connection so that that makes the

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,450
end users feel much more approachable it

00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:49,370
the other thing that I wanted to say is

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,100
do not always just think of one device

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,710
in mind such as Google assist assistant

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,330
which just has voice input think of the

00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,769
multitude of devices on which this is

00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,269
going to be available all the way from

00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:05,000
TVs to your headphones to speakers so

00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:07,279
always have you have the ability to

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,529
query the capabilities of a platform and

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,750
you have the ability to respond to it

00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:16,010
depending on where the users made a

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:20,240
query this is what I showed you in the

00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:26,350
code and like I said you can actually

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:29,779
have suggestion chips here basic cards

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,820
carousels lists so in case you want a

00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:34,490
user to basically get something done

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,919
quickly example something that I do very

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,409
very often is every day when I go back

00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,779
home I basically want to know what is

00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:43,279
when is the next bus coming right I'm

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,809
sure people in Singapore are fairly

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,500
familiar with this kind of a used case

00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:50,840
and I want these suggestion ships to me

00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,549
every time that I launch this

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,840
application so again providing

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:58,820
suggestion chips is very very vital the

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,970
other thing last few minutes I would say

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,899
is no reuse it also trying to understand

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,360
where he is from

00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:08,419
such as let's say you're from the

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,820
national library board NLB then one

00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:13,370
important thing for you to know is okay

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,170
where is the nearest bookstore and what

00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,330
is what are the books available in that

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,540
nearest library right so you have the

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:24,230
ability to know the users address or

00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:26,510
pick up other information you also have

00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,820
the ability to sign in right so just

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,310
like whatever is available in the mobile

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,790
world today is now available to you in

00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,710
the Google assistant platter you also

00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,130
have the ability to transact with the

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,720
user

00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,150
this is currently I think available only

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,590
in the US and UK and not every but we

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,560
are looking to roll this out to more

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,510
regions in more markets so again all the

00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,860
way from starting a conversation with an

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:53,720
assistant making the shopping cart or

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,880
basically adding items to a shopping

00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,520
cart and fulfilling the request and

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,790
basically making a payment can all be

00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:04,990
done with the Google assistant right so

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,600
that's the end-to-end life cycle or the

00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:10,220
transaction cycle that can be done and

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,500
this is how transactions typically look

00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:16,010
you have the ability to put in delivery

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,950
addresses you basically then look at the

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,690
entire order you say place order and

00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,580
then it goes into your order history

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,970
where again you can basically look back

00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,620
at the orders that you have placed so

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:32,060
really end-to-end platform on which

00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:34,160
commerce and delivery can happen and the

00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:38,900
Google assistant is not limited to the

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:42,590
devices such as the phones or the car

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,680
stereos etc let's say you build a custom

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,850
device today let's say you're building

00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,250
unique hardware let's say you're making

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,860
a coffee machine that basically will

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,240
respond to voice input there again you

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,670
can basically put in the Google

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,950
assistant right so think of this as just

00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,070
a library that you can basically put

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:04,100
into any hardware for that to basically

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,020
have voice input commands right and if

00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,050
you search online we basically have this

00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,870
cocktail mixer which was built some time

00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:15,200
in IO last year where all you have to

00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:17,090
say is hey build me a mango shake or a

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,980
summer drink and what it does it

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,410
basically says okay based on the drink

00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,690
it will basically pull in let's say 20%

00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,790
of the grass from the yellow and then

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,050
the other from a coconut from let's say

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,880
the white and it can basically do make

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,890
for you based on the request that you

00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,100
have made again there is no touching

00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:37,500
it's all voice and that has because of

00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:42,390
the Google assistant going into the

00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:45,210
cocktail mixer conversation a design

00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:48,419
like I said ensure that the conversation

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,450
is like speaking to a human what's the

00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,770
difference there's a lot but we have

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,700
basically put together a set of

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:58,260
guidelines so that you can create better

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,210
assistant driven applications just not

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,950
on the Google assistant but generally a

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:06,630
voice enabled interaction right we also

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:10,650
have code labs so that you can basically

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:14,070
try out some code and we have a lot of

00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:19,970
videos such as this in case you want to

00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:23,070
take a photo of the URL right that's me

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,440
you can follow the Google system tend

00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,480
all the latest news on this that's me

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,030
again and finally I just wanted to say

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,010
in case your startup who is basically

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,080
interested in building applications such

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,820
as this you want to use the Google cloud

00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,310
platform in case you're a startup

00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,000
you can basically apply here and get

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:44,880
$3,000 of credits but with that thank

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,530
you do I have a minute for a question no

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,190
I'm already over time all right thank

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,190
you everyone bye

00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,960
