As the security landscape changes, especially in a cloud-based world, the biggest security threats shift away from physical machine access or VPN compromise toward emerging threats like improper software practices, social engineering attacks, or vulnerabilities in underlying libraries. This emerging threat model forces us to re-think traditional security practices in more modern and innovative approaches to intrusion detection and response.

This talk discusses the principles of modern security and how a free and open source tool - HashiCorp Vault - embodies and enforces the principles of modern security.
