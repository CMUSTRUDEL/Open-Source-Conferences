Title: How FOSSASIA Scales Up and What Comes Next - Hong Phuc Dang- FOSSASIA 2018
Publication date: 2018-03-23
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Hong Phuc Dang, Founder FOSSASIA

The FOSSASIA developer network is one of the largest communities in the Open Source world today and we are proud to have a positive impact and improving people's lives with Open Technologies. It took us years to develop approaches and processes to scale projects and we are constantly reviewing and working hard on improving ourselves. So, what is next?

What do we want to do next, what do we want to do better and how do we want to help more people, train developers, create better software and hardware and do good?

We came up with three areas, that we want to focus on:

1. In 2018, it is our goal to improve the quality of work of the FOSSASIA organization and contributions in our projects. We believe that the way to move forward is to provide project owners with more responsibilities and ownership. We aim to develop more and more into an organization that provides a framework for projects. Therefore we will continue to develop programs like Codeheat, OpenTechNights, organize meetups, participate in GSoC and GCI. We also plan to cooperate more with other organizations. Why shouldn't we run the OpenTechNights at events around the world and help to bring people together? Why shouldn't we have more OpenTechSummits with partners in China, India and Vietnam?

2. We have made very good experience with our best practices. We have seen that newcomers can progress very fast if they feel welcome and receive help and guidance from others. After they become participants in our programs many contributors move on to support others as mentors. We also see that contributors have moved to large companies, but still continue to help others in the community. This is wonderful. We want to share our experience and inspire other projects. Therefore, we plan to participate in more events, we will set up a monthly live-cast and we will run a YouTube series on these topics. While a lot of traditional school education still encourages a top-down approach we will focus our attention even more on enabling the community to collaborate on an equal level and follow the idea of sharing ideas and code freely.

3. A question that any organization and project encounters over time is how to ensure the work and setup is sustainable? What settings do projects need to succeed? While there are many non-profit organizations out there developing Open Technologies and FOSS, we also see that many people are moving on to companies that often focus on proprietary solutions and prevent contributors from continuing their engagement in the Open Tech community due to financial reasons and to support their families. At the same time, we see many projects that would have a great potential to be Open Source and at the same time commercially successful. Therefore we are starting a new dedicated FOSSASIA Accelerator that is specifically for Open Source projects. We invite projects to apply for the accelerator and investors and companies to team up with us. And, think about it, while many startups these days start with an idea, Open Source startups already have a product before any investment has started. So, these are great opportunities!

The problems in this world are too big. There is a lot of injustice, we are destroying the environment and people are even fighting each others. At FOSSASIA we want to set an example of collaboration across borders and cultures. So, please join us and let's make this a success. I wish everyone a wonderful event full of sharing and new understandings. Let's get inspired to share and learn for each other to build a better world.

00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:42,130
try to do it in five minutes okay have

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:45,970
you seen this picture before yeah okay

of course right so um okay so this is

00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,130
the photo you've seen all over the place

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,930
maybe some people get both quietly

00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,180
always you the same photo to advertise

00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,820
for the conference ring but for me is

00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,450
embody so much what this community is

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,670
about we bring together people from all

00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,549
over the world to reate open technology

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,619
to share technology and improve people's

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:13,719
lives that what the meaning mentioned

00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:16,420
earlier what do we want to do next what

00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,909
can we do better and how can we have

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,090
more people train more developers and

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:26,619
create better software and also hardware

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:29,979
for everyone so forth Asia the team and

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:33,609
also our community we come up with three

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:36,280
areas that we want to focus on and I

00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:41,439
would like to share with you now number

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:44,249
one in 2018 it is our god improve the

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,590
quality of the work of the for Asia

00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:49,689
organization so my partner Mario he

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,799
mentioned earlier was Asia is not only

00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:56,799
an event we develop software if you're

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,139
heaven encounter or have heaven try out

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,159
any of us aware please Google for Asia

00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:04,899
on github so I think there are over 200

00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,840
repositories on behalf of the force Asia

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,910
room and once housed in the later number

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,720
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,830
something contributors on how to have

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,890
yeah and we believe that the only way to

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,650
move forward with the project for the

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,340
developments to provide the developers

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,280
contributors the ownership and more

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,350
responsibilities inside the project so

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,510
forth Asia we aim to develop more and

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,630
more into an organization that provides

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,700
a framework for projects therefore we

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,120
will continue to develop our programs

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,940
like code head which you will see more

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,950
after might roll open tech nice

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,660
organized meetups participate in google

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,470
Summer of Code as well google code-in

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,920
and we also plan to cooperate more with

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,900
organization I usually got a question

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,920
like why force Asia in Singapore why

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,510
don't we do it in India China for some

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,580
of it now a lot of people want to go to

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,650
Vietnam actually did the picture that

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,280
you saw like my profile picture was

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,760
taken in Cambodia in 2010 it was nine

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,690
years ago

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,300
and here's about now so the answer is

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,480
yes we plan to expand our scope of

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,959
course we love in here home of more so

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,570
for Asia developers in China my in

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,270
settle and we are having an open

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,370
pepsiman in China at the end of Samba

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,390
and followed by another event in Vietnam

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,810
during the winter this year

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,400
okay go to the second area number two we

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,670
have make a very good experience with

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,680
our best practices anyone relative for

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,060
Asia have better practices haven't seen

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,510
it before us and we are online

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,330
okay so again if you google developer

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,600
for Asia of that practices I think is it

00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,110
really Sofia Marisa if we compress a lot

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,720
of information of many developers and

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:07,320
organize a force Asia for the past few

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,420
years a lot of you for information so we

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,730
have seen newcomers can progress very

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,090
fast if they feel welcome receive help

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,250
and guidance from others after they

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,039
become participant in our programs many

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,310
contributors move on to become mentors

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:28,300
for younger

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:31,030
and newcomers we also see contributors

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,760
got employed by large companies so they

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,100
they contributed for Asia they improve

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,440
their github profile because they

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,030
contribute so much open so they also get

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,500
well-known into the community and got

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,860
higher by company like Google morozov or

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,080
echo and many more but the good thing is

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,180
they still continue the engagement with

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,180
the community this is so wonderful room

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,850
ok so what I want is really quiet yeah I

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:08,410
thought okay so even refunded like

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,270
somebody with some comment okay so the

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,710
work what bring me here until today we

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,480
would like to say our experience and

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,510
idea how we do work on our project to

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,690
other people we plan to participate in

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:26,260
more events not only the 4th Asia but we

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,960
were in the CCC linic the open source

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:33,250
submit in North America for sort of in

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,930
many other the new thing that we've

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,800
learned to do we're gonna set up a

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:42,250
monthly fly class one just happened

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,490
about three days ago and we we also run

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,900
a YouTube theory on these topics about

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,870
open source and how to roll your

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,180
projects so if you haven't check out the

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,930
force Asia YouTube channel please do so

00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:01,800
today and more videos about this topic

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,840
will come up yeah lastly number three a

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,870
question that any organization

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,270
encounters over time is how to ensure

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,600
sustainability of your project what

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,550
setting do project need to succeed while

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,830
there are many nonprofit organization

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,590
out there developing open technologies

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,580
and fourth we often see that people

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,040
moving to companies that focus only on

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,510
for our sleep solution prevent

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,510
developers from continuing their

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,000
engagement in the open tech community at

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,490
the same time we see many projects that

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,720
would

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:42,590
a great potential to be open source and

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,599
commercially successful therefore also a

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,099
new thing so we are starting a new

00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,000
dedicated force Asia

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:52,550
accelerator that is specially for open

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,970
source projects and we inviting

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,090
companies investor in projects to team

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,039
up with us if you really think about it

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,810
a lot of people now they're talking

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,139
about stack up so people want to become

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,080
a founder as long as they have a new

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:11,330
idea they can open a company but look at

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,919
it in the open source community they're

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,780
not only an idea so we have an

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,610
established project in some good

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,099
solution already out there so there's a

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,759
lot of potential to bring open source

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:28,099
project into startup and make commercial

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:30,289
and make a commercial case so we hope

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,710
that we will launch the force Asia

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:43,610
accelerator in the upcoming month okay

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:45,590
finally I would like to to say the world

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,349
is so big there's so many problems and

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,840
always people feel that unjust astray

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,000
and also here we Detroit the environment

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,580
every day especially for those people

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,919
who flew in from everywhere like 20 20

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,289
hours on the blue yeah so we have

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,440
packages but we also at the same time

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:05,810
want to make a difference we want to say

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,930
and assemble for collaboration across

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,740
the border and cultures so please join

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,300
us and make this a success first of all

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,849
if you are so bored and don't know what
