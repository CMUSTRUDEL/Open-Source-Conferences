In this session, we will discuss the concept of serverless architecture, which is also called FAAS (Functions as a service). We will take a closer look at what this often confusing term means and how we can take advantage to create new generation solutions.

AWS Lambda being the most popular implementation (yet), we will look at a sample implementation, challenges and other concerns.
