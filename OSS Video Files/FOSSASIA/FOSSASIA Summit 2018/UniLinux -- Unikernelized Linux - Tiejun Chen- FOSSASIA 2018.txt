Unikernel is a novel software technology that links an application with OS in the form of a library and packages them into a specialized image that facilitates direct deployment on a hypervisor. Comparing to the traditional VM or the recent containers Unikernels are smaller more secure and efficient making them ideal for cloud environments. There are already lots of open source projects like OSv Rumprun and so on. But why these existing unikernels have yet to gain large popularity broadly? We think Unikernels are facing three major challenges: 1. Compatibility with existing applications 2. Lack of production support (e.g. monitoring debugging logging) 3. Lack of compelling use case 4. Lack of standard to Unikernels. In my presentation I will review our investigations and exploration of if-how we can convert Linux as Unikernel to eliminate these significant shortcomings where I name this as UniLinux and some potential but valuable use cases to Unikernels like IoT Serverless and IO-intensive applications.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
hello and thank you very much for coming

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,180
here to my presentation and I'd like to

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,649
start off by introducing myself I use

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,230
the my name is a church in Japan you can

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,110
call me kid you kidding

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,330
I'm from wherever China Andy if you say

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,609
otherwise Italian order center so now a

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,730
team are recently I'm working on lg

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:24,080
internet Alison and I the computing the

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,550
any exploration relates to the IOT

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,590
actually I have besides AMA I have some

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,710
personal research back to the protection

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,809
meaning Colonel and Allison is that real

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,840
time modulation because I think that's a

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,059
good area in the future and before I

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,760
join the VMware I also work at several

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,620
company no you might hear some names

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,230
knack of in the river system we're

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,329
responsible for many rulings kernel and

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,070
PSP development and the winner would

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,870
have a well and the winner where the

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,730
paralyzed the caster wise but the open

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,100
saw the tech another Center

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,829
physical our team was trying to enable

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,140
some hardware feature to open-source

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,970
technology community naka Kiwi am and

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,280
then and the commune okay there's

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,810
something about myself today I'm going

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,330
to talk about one of my Ãºnica

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,299
exploration unions

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,640
I'd like to explore if we can unique are

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,400
links to comment links it to you even in

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,480
kernel okay so this should be your guide

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,860
to interest

00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,410
so each time I haven't make this sort of

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,650
experiment because as I mentioned it's

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:34,090
just my personal exploration so it's not

00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,090
commitment or do the math from VMware

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,650
for our limited time and today are just

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,690
a few items first of all I like to

00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:48,260
introduce you to some unique oh no

00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,630
background and then and we let's reveal

00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,480
that concept are my unique honor

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,310
proposal and the second product I'd like

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,240
to talk assumption related how the Union

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,240
Colonel beings

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,120
okay I'm not sure how many guys I have

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,320
another unique Renault

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,570
I guess no one really okay anyway so

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,440
just take a look at this picture I think

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,440
this car how about you and stand up oh

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,440
sorry

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,940
at least the speakers on the bottom side

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,220
that can help you understand all that

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,040
the insider was happening from VM to

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,280
Ewing colonel p.m. what you machine you

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,890
know what for a relaxing environment

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,350
virtual machine were protected isolated

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,630
by hideaway what relation technology but

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,780
they are high weight because they are

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,550
involved too much VM contacted speech so

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,500
I'll cover his goal we had a container

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,620
like a doctor it's a very convenient

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,480
allow it if we were know something like

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:55,480
a macro stories and develop and secure

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,370
the color container basically it's based

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,530
on some existing internal feature

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,750
nickname space and see group and

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:07,840
capability more importantly all can just

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,269
share welcome host OS so if something is

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,660
wrong with this host OS they could help

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:16,600
prepare to all containers you remember

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,400
us in 2015 I said there was a famous

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,980
brother that's a dirty copy on write

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,100
that memory services the work that is

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,470
really allowed continued to escape so on

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,690
some people started thinking can we the

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,660
trim down at host OS and then we can

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,850
deploy one or few the container inside

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,299
but it is your the traditional of the

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,040
system that exclusion model like let's

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,799
give'em between kernel space and user

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,870
space so what about you in colonel euni

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,019
kernel way on build application into

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,660
that one can open system where we just

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,739
keep those are necessary parts to make

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,090
release the service Oddie the

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,609
application to wrong

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,709
so this like laboratory's application

00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,239
but we build them either the whole

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,909
immediate now there is no division

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,650
between kernels materials well

00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,360
so now let's look at how to keep filing

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,189
you in colonel according to week page

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,799
are you in colonel specialized and

00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:11,689
single address much image constructed by

00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,480
using laboratory system

00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:18,019
you just remember specialized a single

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,000
dress space and live wife and let

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,669
categorize them to our different groups

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,120
the first one is that general purpose

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,729
even in Cronulla it connects the it

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,600
elaborates that the general can always -

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,900
wrong that counter application but using

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,389
well established that is a specification

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,330
either for the links or for UNIX or I

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:45,139
mean like that politics complaint in

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,530
this case of a peddler and I'll go grads

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:52,220
our language suppose renewed languages

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,410
suppose silicon in Cronulla it acts as a

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,550
memory but the specific to one

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:01,180
programming language like that Moreira

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,470
wise it's written with that Oh camo

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,060
actually torrents now are not familiar

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,460
with some special language but

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,380
reportedly on this conversion it can

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,080
work very well and efficiently in some

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,509
cases especially for that networking kid

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,639
so I'll think about that definition I

00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,190
think that even cannot however these

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,379
latter characteristic similar recipes

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,139
that means we can do that a dirac hope

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,419
we can allocate that he'll repeat that's

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,300
a single Ronnie model that means I don't

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,129
don't need that highway system call

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,139
instead we can you get a function call

00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:36,270
and there's something behind this that

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,729
most times just wrong one processor

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,740
maybe with the motors right but this

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:44,669
mean we don't need at hiring a context

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,539
switch like that are in the case our x86

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:50,580
we don't need to reload the CRE so I'm

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,719
basically the characteristic arm even

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,719
colonel compared

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,440
so what does it mean that it's immune to

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:04,880
the int of CIB leakage the realest verse

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,889
would that mean that you knew that to

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,220
have a cabbie flash why the color which

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:14,500
are the wrong one process but is it into

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,500
the recent cash related parties

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:23,060
oh okay okay I think we can assume that

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,620
you can approve on one side that even

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,020
Connor is very cool because of it just

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,419
wrong one process we don't need needed a

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,819
tacky dpi that attach because they don't

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:36,530
have that are given between kernel-space

00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:39,590
or your spirit of injured in a pack okay

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,669
so on comparator VM and compare a human

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,770
compiler container

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:45,440
I see only kind of the Ocampa raddest

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:49,550
user benefits them the first one is a

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,039
improve the security because essentially

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,500
at you Nakano is your the vm button

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:58,569
light vm and they are protected by the

00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,880
hardware virtualization technology and

00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:05,300
none so that that means that a text

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:09,590
service is reduced too much and I'd

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,479
again because wrong one so meantime we

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,580
can get that smaller small for the

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:17,150
Bruins and the fastboot and they also

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,860
can highly optimized on the one hand we

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,639
can you that allow it to t be able that

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,009
I all stack and we also can allow them

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,520
that means we can try to add a very good

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,039
out performance

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,350
so actually there a lot of exist in

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,930
Unicode at least some name here like

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,449
Leslie I include alas I mean that's a

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,699
jawbreaker in the Microsoft and unique

00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,620
actually is another unique honor is that

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:44,110
the tool it helped me to compare

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,930
application to some a glistening kernel

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,780
just suppose three equally unique or not

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,380
a unique or at least that are separately

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,910
because this was just launched last year

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,160
because they think that's a fundamental

00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,319
drawback to you Nakano either you needed

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,449
that additional effort to build an

00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,430
application to the Union colonel so they

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,650
are trying to provide that library pull

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,289
some library is true that's a

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,599
architecture some library the tool as a

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,190
platform or to atrophy of the system and

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,009
then the provider that's the pewter

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:20,650
system to help you build it at uni color

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:22,930
image from that library you select some

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,780
unique on solutions I have the most

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,909
imaginative her in 2015 and talk that

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,580
acquired unique honor system

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:32,770
so after that it has brought out at a

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,099
considerable attention to unique kernel

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,310
and it also helped release the true

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,750
project a brigade and replicated

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,959
basically each one to improving that

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,690
make you talk her experience to that Mac

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:49,870
OS and windows Eliza

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:52,930
mekin angela is a HPC framework high

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,990
problems actual performance of rework

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,140
so it's a Hydra to have a better formula

00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,470
optimized from the key Ram but you get a

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,980
waste

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,390
they are you lat Oh sp1 existing happen

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,130
a unique kernel well I have three

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:12,100
because a dimensional unit cannot has a

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:14,589
CUDA I will throw put our performance

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,829
and it's very small so some people use

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,360
that unit kind of construction that's

00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:21,880
line from the instance of like virtual

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,279
router or firewall and the Z just

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,050
shortly because it just is wrong on the

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,690
bounder that means that it's a heart

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,760
attack because you don't need you know

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,200
you don't have enough talent to cut it

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,200
out see inside the service

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,370
so I'm based on some investigation and

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,260
some discussion nice we think that you

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:47,450
cannot really come here that a good

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:49,340
performance but mmm I gotta sell are

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,410
there a lot of it is unique or not but

00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,130
it's hard to see them in the production

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:58,250
your environment so I think they are

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:01,070
feeling some challenges like like a

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,120
compelling you'll occasion you Nakano is

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,430
not such a soon

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,020
I mean one size fits all so we need to

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,680
figure out what's that a potential that

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,850
a value or user Krista to uni colonel

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,370
another challenge is the compatibility

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:17,270
you Nakano is not very different as a

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:21,200
traditional proceed existing legs

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,990
application directly under how to

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,640
monitor debug logger that because a unit

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,590
cannot just support one process the most

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,260
channel so that means if we want to use

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:35,630
the existing to doll utility we cannot

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,610
run it another that there are variety of

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,800
unique Renaldo I think we miss that

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,580
standard to make sure you in canister to

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,280
succeed so last year's very stinking

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,340
cool we know unique is approved by rail

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,800
or broadly cutaway connection links to

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,960
uni Colonel so I have a structure at a

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,070
proposal I want to that converter links

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,810
to eunuch Colonel

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,000
because I think means that can help us

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,820
address some challenges means to have

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,190
that many many other kids links supposed

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,130
a different library and the support are

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,290
different that's it I was tax and it has

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,960
some different a tool and utility we can

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,300
reuse them and same time I think link

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,300
the sort of the skill unit developer

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,940
cycle so I need an optimization on an

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,170
image acceleration its do compare

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,380
feature you in colonel

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,830
so now that I look at her what could we

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,430
do

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,650
so basically our target our goal is to

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,080
explore what's the best platform for

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,910
running eunuch colonel kizhe actually I

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,150
have that architecture colleagues at

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:41,730
Universal it's a composite of four other

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,730
primary components well first put the

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,190
wine is a union eeks so I trying to

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,590
modify an internal to explore it's that

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,230
unique kind of carrot risk to catch as

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,830
by the performance the next party you

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,750
need combo I still want to integrate

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,480
some existing Ãºnico not because

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,810
different the other capital allocator

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,050
multiple different that's requirement

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,810
another party that a unique operated kit

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,400
basically is it you learn to that

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,320
automated build a victim to help us

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,110
build that application to our unique

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,940
image and as the product is at Union

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,550
manager this is the sort of the

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,450
controller overall that our union

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,940
Inkster VM and it's poets have function

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,300
ability and through that a REST API and

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,430
through which that every connect ninth

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,810
can be interactively that are unique

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:40,060
hello VM

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:42,589
today I just focus on UNIX so position

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,190
young economy and we are wrong in run

00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,940
mode

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:50,149
when's that debate so when should this

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,820
make unique Iranian video at one mode

00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:56,779
and run that stimulus place that means

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,670
here that focus on the x86 64 bit so

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,649
that means that all both that you love

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:06,230
staff and you earn kind of staff should

00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:09,920
be wrong as a deal so I how to modify by

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,019
2 and the you CFDs and that's GDP

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,199
unsuitable to make sure your staff is

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:20,899
running with the room 0 but we have

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:23,269
problem think about the reason you your

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,730
staff is running with its spec us back

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:28,610
but some timing you know that your stack

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,769
is not mapped hoping to expand that us

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,380
dead so at the sixth time it will

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,380
trigger that's a pitiful but at least

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,440
it's the moment certain moment you stack

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,769
is not very so CPU cannot see with some

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,250
information like that of theater at ERP

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:48,350
so it will trigger another fault

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,079
that's double fault but again spec is

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,589
not they are not valid so that causes

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:56,690
the pure panic how can we handle it

00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:58,540
situation so unfortunate unfortunately

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,519
we have a larger as teeth are

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,730
interactive on this mechanism that means

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,829
he as as task estate other segment has

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,079
that filled with that point the true

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:12,170
that it that the interrupt stack that

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:14,120
means I did this moment CPU can switch

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,550
that he was dead the truth some

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,180
dedicated cannot spec this problem can

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,210
be resolved

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,250
so next thing about the other in fact

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,070
really a so you know really also has a

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:31,080
beam give up through a powerful data

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,839
system the call button without you from

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,730
last week but I know that's unique I

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,380
mean we are running one space cannot

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,650
business we don't need that state cost

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,339
so we just redirect that's a suitable

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,980
code for the function call here

00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:49,890
next thing is about suppose Alexis to

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,490
expect what I mean some application

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:56,040
they'd probably be compared and built

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,140
physically so in this case we have a

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,620
just an experiment but fortunately it's

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,800
just a few kissing a single trust based

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,950
means that arm which is wrong with the

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,690
condo space week and so on in this case

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,690
the weight on the provider walk

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,860
so besides that single I'm single

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,050
stress space understandable I have opted

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,050
them together the small side on the

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,240
performance so first thing is that big

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,430
kind of the key topic typically we can

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,230
keyboard all the unnecessary that's a

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,830
natural subsystem or the square was

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:39,040
something like that together the smaller

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:41,470
member decide I want to separate him

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,780
system cause now they wish to call the

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,050
function call now 100 this can reduce

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,880
that memory size under 900 and see make

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,090
sure oversee we wouldn't need that

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,540
unnecessary cyst called functional

00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:57,160
Mazzio copy the copy I think they should

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,040
go because they are wrong you cannot

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,930
space so such other check or copy

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,150
between cannot Spencer to your spirit

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,700
for the goal of way that is that guy put

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:13,510
a euro copy from to you we should make

00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:15,520
that schedule another problem you know

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,820
talk about the native of that terminal

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,220
links beside that stop hello we have

00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,410
natural CFS we have an RT we have a

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,240
deadline but no no because the wrong one

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,850
processor so we don't need it is too

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,580
complicated at a scheduled classes so

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,560
I'm trying to that decoupling schedule

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,510
classes to make sure we can

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,760
customers scheduler according to

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,220
different application requirement but

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,650
they also really one question to me so

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,720
the way we design new lot scheduler who

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,560
are wrong these kids I mean that just

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,560
one process

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:53,940
next thing is that uh tcpip spec link is

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,700
the highlight of good at Network stack

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,040
because it's a general procedure it can

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,980
trust different at a user's manual but I

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,260
know we just want one for one processor

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,589
maybe one service so we don't need these

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,990
complex that kiss API spec instead we

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,940
can introduce a summer liability

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,730
tcp/ip stack like that the language

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:18,360
happy and the fastest okayed they start

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,820
something like that this is not a

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,400
difficult because I think logically

00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,740
already working to how to our integrated

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,870
is on Larry TCP stack and through that

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:33,570
link which has sort of like the

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:36,120
integration well when I say that you

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,550
know be found that our standard links

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,890
actually we have not held at the links

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,470
of variants we have a see links we have

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,660
the Jeff Skilling's we have a maturity

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:50,220
links so if your can make sure that

00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,620
Union inks can provide it is different

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,350
profile it can help us address different

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,520
your scenario like prom the links we can

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,520
put it is there two out case

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,720
if you are these people how depending on

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,600
different that you look old had a source

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,399
code which has we compare that to stand

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,320
elaborate actually Liberty where we

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:16,000
replace their to funk a certain Kobe's

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,850
function call you just need to be

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,919
compare your school oh if you have the

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,340
binary but if you that compared me

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:31,600
that's this flag I cannot share the pic

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:34,120
so we can you knew that that to a

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,130
function call other kids I think they

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:42,909
are not a dominant so I don't consider

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:45,130
them a multi-process and I think if we

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:47,440
want to catch the best performance for

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,539
the eunuch colonel you'll better to read

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,460
align your application to migrate the

00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,940
prominent and multi-process model to let

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,340
MOT a multiple letters read model but if

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,010
you cannot avoid if you do not want to

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,690
do this then I think there's two

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,940
approach to address this the first of

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,279
the way is that through the forward that

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,789
means one fork triggered one at Union

00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:12,039
Inkster image but that means that IPC is

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,279
becoming that intervene communication is

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,769
Howard but fortunately we have that we

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,130
have function in the instruction is from

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,929
Intel that week feature which can you

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,149
judge pre-constructed

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:28,740
epd table to build that a faster

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:31,929
undeceive way to communicate between vm

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,840
another approach is at peace adding is

00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:38,620
the acronym of the process context

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,169
identifier you can treat that as such a

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,350
process ID that means that you can tag

00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:47,830
care B so that means here we can hold

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,830
the translation for the D pruner process

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,520
at the same time it can help reduce them

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,740
overhead for that context which

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,170
but unfortunately it has had limited

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,390
abuser so the Justice opposes limited

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,490
the processor but as a nice now because

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,190
I want to use it is to support that's

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,530
debug on the money the tool to support

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,900
all the existing tools and utility

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,090
because they are like I saw the second

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:16,710
all that sorta data process are unique

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:21,240
actually in the very beginning I had

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,340
this that proposal I have this seem

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,230
sorta but I'm not sure we can use that

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,360
in the league because mutinies is not

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:32,190
supposed x86 button they can't run at a

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,300
multiple on task in the single dress

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:38,460
space last year I made this partition

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,170
across several that open source emits

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,179
the hosted release and Foundation when

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,970
some accounts all readers questions

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,700
could read you the mutant links so I

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:51,200
think maybe it's in the right direction

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,200
but no enough

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,000
so other something about our

00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:01,730
enhancements like I want to skip the

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,910
bowels and integrated at once more

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,910
bootloader I can use a DP gdb to replace

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:11,150
it CPI partially and I knew that one one

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,640
part and give us maybe because you know

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,960
unique it already is customers either we

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:21,140
know which us and which but other and

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,710
some modulation instructional facial

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,480
which kanika help us reduce at the vm a

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,960
great to have us scheduled at a better

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,960
performance

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,660
so on yes I'm talking about some some

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,350
user kisses laughs we already said that

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:43,380
uh blazer blazer on promise model most

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,630
of that the public capital idea already

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,210
supposedly so Lisa basically that means

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,910
you just need to write a political

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,280
function but without managing and

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,740
provisioning your BM your results

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,300
instead that's a public record provider

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,710
we all allocated as a result auntie mom

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,450
but it's basically the user can turn on

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,730
I think the unique is that a good a

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,050
compliment to that so laser because you

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,750
have to consider that the different

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,970
cures ecology of a service maybe

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,220
sometimes have to translate the security

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:18,270
issue unique can happen to installation

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,280
and the also you think it's the sort of

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,560
a chain coda I mean I change that

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,200
function I mean you can put a lot of

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,880
function if you have a summer share

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,720
summer results you can put the damage in

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,820
the UNIX an Apple auction you know

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,220
production can help also protected as a

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,870
sensitive data but we also need to

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,230
protect data production yourself

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,860
the blockchain that the chain code is

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,450
carried out by the to the stalker so at

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,210
this point I think a week I knew that

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,970
you need to replace that token and

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,070
emotionally as a good Canada to the

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,910
other unique because those exist

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,280
unicolor

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,010
Kansas suppose a GPU but a unique can

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:03,600
choose suppose if you I would he is an

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:06,030
hour story I like that because uh just

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,430
go back as another and like that

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:11,280
real-time modulation but relation is

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,590
really good for that I would he because

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,060
it can help create a summer isolation

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,480
and the security issue and a

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,430
fragmentation and that can totally

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,430
consolidation and that's a mix correct

00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,590
ability or the problem but you know how

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,570
did you ask is that embedded devices

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,930
most times they are resource construed

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:33,070
so we need that this are UNIX is allow

00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,280
each VM

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,610
[Music]

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,840
also I sing see someone represent to my

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,300
presentation and the last thing I'd like

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,660
to mention here that released year

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,240
that's our SEM Association over that a

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,030
Computing Machinery at International

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,720
Conference on supercomputing we all be

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,200
held under two Troon under in Beijing

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,450
China

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,280
you know this ECM is as it should be the

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,510
one of the top academic is that

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,790
comprehension so my habitat proposal

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,840
without a unicorn or workshop and this

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:11,310
was accepted by that is an ICS so if we

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,590
are in for the eunuch Colonel I'm

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,290
reading your paper and presentation will

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:21,350
be sponsored and just trying to reach

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,350
out to me okay they start my protection

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,770
any question

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,770
this place

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,170
suicide or

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,920
your case for emotionally oh just

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:44,110
generally I mean as the unique second

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,000
links that can support the GPU you

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,950
Linksys yoga tablet if you are a thinker

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,490
we can put our using the two that are

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,490
watching you know emotional in case

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,490
generally

00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,140
what a district policy based on modular

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,740
survive

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,740
yeah

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:07,850
regarding five of children

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:11,600
there are lots of equivalents if you

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:15,320
want replaces Xavier file to come loaded

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,450
then why places you you haven't happy to

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,970
talk about their application they redeem

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,170
us

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,929
how are you

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:27,380
the desktop your I think are not

00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:29,240
isolated usually talk to each other talk

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,760
each other you know between we am around

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:38,990
you mean ip0

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:43,450
I mean with other Asian included at

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:47,350
peace I know

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:50,660
so you quite a mean one processor in

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:53,090
while that's another way they have

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,640
communicated between them I mean we

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,840
conducted interview communication like a

00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,360
share memory between this VM yeah share

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,740
Mary businessman that's what I mentioned

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,480
that a VM function then function that

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,299
instruction from another virtualizer

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,700
extension patrol the banana canoe the

00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:16,820
EPG table if you'd really that mean we

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,179
do need to have that too much of VM a

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,179
grater

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,970
the distinction of being this is a

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,900
movement for instance or a financial

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,710
perspective each

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,710
and that book

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:43,440
it's just time I would occasion I do

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,440
yeah just application I mean

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,100
