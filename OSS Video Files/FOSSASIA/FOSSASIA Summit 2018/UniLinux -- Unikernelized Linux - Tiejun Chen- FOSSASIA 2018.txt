Unikernel is a novel software technology that links an application with OS in the form of a library and packages them into a specialized image that facilitates direct deployment on a hypervisor. Comparing to the traditional VM or the recent containers Unikernels are smaller more secure and efficient making them ideal for cloud environments. There are already lots of open source projects like OSv Rumprun and so on. But why these existing unikernels have yet to gain large popularity broadly? We think Unikernels are facing three major challenges: 1. Compatibility with existing applications 2. Lack of production support (e.g. monitoring debugging logging) 3. Lack of compelling use case 4. Lack of standard to Unikernels. In my presentation I will review our investigations and exploration of if-how we can convert Linux as Unikernel to eliminate these significant shortcomings where I name this as UniLinux and some potential but valuable use cases to Unikernels like IoT Serverless and IO-intensive applications.
