	Speaker: Tarun Kumar, Developer FOSSASIA
Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#tarun-kumar3043

An internet kiosk is a special use case. A single computer is shared by an indefinite number of users. Lots of security concerns arise. In Asia and elsewhere multiple non-latin languages have to be supported. We decided to create a custom lightweight distribution Meilix and a generator web app that allows you to preconfigure an ISO with the wallpaper and desktop settings in place.

00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:31,800
Tufts last year I work for G sock I was

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,120
a mentor in GCI 817 and code hit 17 I

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,820
work in many reports but for the

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,970

that's quite disturbed me as well as you

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,750
the next the screen shaver sleep mode

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,820
and strained image I am going to

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,730
represent I am speaking continuously

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:50,260
five minutes on a slide and both the

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:52,210
screens went off next system sounds

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,130
while I am playing a video some system

00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:58,240
sound Papa asked them it's like

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,890
hesitation to us okay therefore yet

00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,270
everything let's change the topic the

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,680
next is programming workshop so what are

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:12,070
the basic necessity in a programming

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,290
workshop are a hackathon ok necessity by

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,270
the organizer means what are the things

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,170
that are more organized and needs to be

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:23,910
set up in the workshop desktop exactly

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:27,280
ok the organizer needs to make clones

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,050
clones of computers he wanted to give

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,950
each and every computer with the same

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:36,610
facility each so he want to make a clone

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,850
he have around 20 to 30 kilo computers

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,760
and organizing each system with the same

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,410
configuration personalization next

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,560
setting up each computer with the same

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:52,810
quantification and personalization so

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,350
how he do that ok any any solution how

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,350
he do that

00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,840
okay

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,019
almost the same hardware all

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,420
very very similar hardware but once you

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,280
are a little bit left or right that's it

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,310
rock on no no different hardware's maybe

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,900
there because the a because if you nice

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,639
quiz coming here to organize a workshop

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:25,060
and here are few systems one kilo fight

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,139
our place and that's it you're one that

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,139
is how how sensitive

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:49,080
we're I got every message much bigger so

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,540
basically what people does or the

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,240
organizer does they use a live image

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,130
with the pre-installed software and they

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,930
boot into the system in the means just

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,340
take an example of an Android workshop

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,010
they should have Android development

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:11,610
Android studio like things Visual Studio

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:13,530
gate and like that so I just talk they

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,450
have a live image with the pre-installed

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,990
software they put into the system and

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:22,190
found all the configurations over there

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,190
is this thing exists still yet

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,580
it is a pendrive with a life would

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,610
having the ability to lie boot and all

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,280
all are the steps are over there means

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,160
if you want a certain libraries certain

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,710
packages certain configuration of

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,460
software's in the pendrive you just plug

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,080
in and you just start over there only

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,790
means you don't have to bring your

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,300
computer you just have your computer in

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:56,870
your pendrive is it possible to no no no

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:59,270
ok let's change the topic again okay

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,240
what's our the requirement of an OS if

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,570
you have an OS an operating system what

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,360
do you require to have in it you mostly

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,280
require an editor but most of the people

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,070
most of the West competent in Builder

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,150
editor just suppose eMac oh I don't like

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,520
everything typing I like sublime so you

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,350
eMac is also taking some space

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,040
sublime will also take some space if you

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:27,980
are very conscious of space you will

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,360
install a Mac and install sublime but

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,410
not much constantly you have both of

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,950
them player some people want genome

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:39,560
players some people want VLC player

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,490
office messenger sect Ramiz everyone has

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,400
its own different desire

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:48,250
so why the next question is why people

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,250
don't reset their system often so I want

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,020
your reviews reset means reinstalling

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,850
your system means you find some bug in

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,520
the system and you don't know how to

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,890
correct that bug so someone said or

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,870
reset the system our format the system

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,400
but say no my data would be lost

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,680
something like that the people say so

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,250
haha

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,300
every six months you do that

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,300
[Music]

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,490
and drive it long

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,740
in the pasta

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,860
in person addicted he customized

00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:42,500
installation

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,500
interaction it's call everything

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,659
okay so what I think yeah

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,330
so mostly people don't reset their

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,430
system because they are fear of data

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,380
loss they don't want to get their data

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,620
loss but this is not the most concerned

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:06,090
reason since we have lots of data on or

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,910
cloud only secondly setting off of

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,790
environment if you set up your computer

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:14,250
in such a way that you love it

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,670
personalization if you see someone's

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,280
computer you say wow you hide your

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,990
taskbar you hide your menu bar oh how

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,870
did you bring that option over there I

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,930
get that in preference or that's look

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,780
quite good so these are the things you

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,210
made it possible and if you just clean

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:39,890
everything it's look just as simple as

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,890
used as using this it's just a and learn

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,390
packages you install some packages and

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:51,090
if you wanted to for Ubuntu users set up

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,400
get set up and genex everything but if

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,880
the system just washed away and reset

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,870
you have to again do abdicate install

00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
software's and internal software

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,890
settings you have some desired

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,740
configuration in chrome you disable your

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,510
bookmark bar you put some particular

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,510
home page you have to do it again

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:16,020
so introducing Malik's Malik's divided

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:21,550
into two Mally in China means beautiful

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:25,530
and Alex loving it extremely so it's a

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:28,630
beautiful Louis we love it extremely

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:34,150
next what are its feature it's based on

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:37,870
Ubuntu 32-bit kernel made was it tree

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,550
there are meta packages I learned

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,220
metaphase a matter packages just last

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,930
year and it is quite useful it has the

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,130
ability to customize the OS from scratch

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,710
you have the power to select the

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,620
software which you need to be in your OS

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,960
you don't have to run out go there

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,960
and install the eMac install sublime you

00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,860
just select sub lime from the scratch

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,790
you just set everything from the scratch

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,460
personalization of a specific software

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:10,060
you can even precise inside of a

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:13,450
software you can even personalize inside

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,910
of a chrome means if you want the search

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,410
engine to be this only at the beginning

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,000
if you want your search engine to be big

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,590
at the beginning you don't have to

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,030
install usually what we do is - well -

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,460
with of default search engine we go

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,180
there and set it to Bing but you can do

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,880
it from the scratch next how to use this

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,340
feature so I just told Malick's it has

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,410
the code repository over on github you

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,680
have to go there understand the readme

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:45,760
and make changes in the code you have to

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,830
first understand the whole repository so

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,740
we will bring you another solution you

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,750
don't have to do this in reducing the

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,750
animal so what's a dynamo is anyone

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,940
exactly we have office cycles over there

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,530
so what it does it just have a dynamo

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,150
over there when we write its terms of

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,450
mechanical energy into the electrical

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,060
energy so you don't have to go there

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,280
read the code base we introduce a dynamo

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:22,110
which is the generator and it's

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:24,030
generating Malick's and it will give you

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,620
an ISO with the with your own

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,480
configuration that you want you don't

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,800
have to go there and read the code

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,730
so why dynamo only it's an autonomous

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:40,470
tool a web app will which will make an

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:42,810
ISO for you so it's quite simpler so for

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,810
getting an ISO you have to use Malick's

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:49,500
and there are two ways first edit the

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:52,590
source quite uncommon and only for

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:57,540
developers the second is the web app for

00:11:52,590 --> 00:12:00,480
everyone who they can get the desire eye

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,630
so just by filling up on form on a web

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,630
app

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,380
this is the home screen of the web app

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:12,050
it's small features it's in the beta and

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:16,040
it just features few things an email ID

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,440
an event name and event link and upload

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,500
wallpaper and the build button you just

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,560
have to enter your email I will talk

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:28,180
about this later event name you have

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,279
since at a time many persons can use so

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,630
it can be used to distinguish between

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:38,600
different users means if someone using

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,760
fossa sheis are made so if the same

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,339
other person uses force Asia submit the

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:49,640
same miss event name is going to be as a

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:52,040
commit so it's basically to make the

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,290
difference you can't use the same you

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,510
may see same event name again and again

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,360
it will say that this has been used

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:04,490
already you have to change it the link I

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,070
said when you install a browser you have

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,020
a default home page you can put here

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,209
what that default home page should be

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,170
and that would be the default home page

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:17,240
of the browser the upload wallpaper when

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,430
you start an operating system it has its

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,339
own wallpaper with the developers who

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:27,980
made it said it but you can give its own

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:30,260
hour your own next okay I only told how

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,959
the code making the OS now the web app

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,630
it's just magic the web app is

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,610
developing NIR so for you it hasn't been

00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,270
invented or hasn't been discovered

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,970
before so this is how it does the web

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,760
app takes now taking in three inputs

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,860
even named wallpaper and homepage URL

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,790
which is

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,649
having a crab means thanks to Travis API

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,899
Malick's uses Travis to get built when

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,540
ever a commit has been made in Malek's

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,189
it uses the Travis triggers

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,559
automatically this continuous

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:08,369
integration and the Travis deployed the

00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,079
ISO in the github release and one who

00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:12,480
wants to download it go to the github

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,689
release and download the ISO but in the

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,089
web app the trigger the ISO through the

00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:22,769
web app sorry we triggered the Travis

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:27,389
through the web app while we just click

00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:29,399
on we just click on the build button the

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,249
commit will be made with the event name

00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,509
and dad will trigger the Travis with the

00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:39,929
same name and it will create an ISO for

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:42,029
you you don't have to make a make any

00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,579
changes in the code and attack commit

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:48,199
will release an ok fine till now

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,199
any questions yeah

00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,920
yeah yeah these are the future aspects

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:58,299
and now we are only providing these two

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,999
off terms if it feel interesting to you

00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,769
we are welcome to you as a developer in

00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:07,360
our community this is a community

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:12,420
driving project so I also released then

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:16,379
guess what I so release so next is what

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,379
so from where you will download

00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:21,439
I said means I am going to give this

00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:24,729
project to common users he don't know

00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:25,969
get up I will explain oh good huh

00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:29,989
exactly

00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:34,669
email so we are going to mail them the

00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:37,939
ISO link I asked the person the email on

00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:39,589
the very first forum so email will be

00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:44,419
sent to him using SendGrid

00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:47,959
within 10 minutes thanks to Mike who has

00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,659
discovered this vr music we invested

00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:55,189
weeks to get this means most of the

00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:58,609
other stuffs are not able to mail us so

00:15:55,189 --> 00:16:00,229
what are the takeaways you are able to

00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:02,419
generate an ad so with your desired

00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:06,919
configuration within 15 minutes just

00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:10,429
from your mobile phone generate an ISO

00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:12,259
for such conferences and next year we

00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:16,219
want to get it developed in such a way

00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:18,859
that we don't want such unix/linux

00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:21,109
like things we used may we have to use

00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:23,509
means we want to use Malik's throughout

00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:25,849
the fossa sheis emitter since now we are

00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:30,709
using open event web app for event a

00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:31,999
before getting tickets next generate for

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,759
distributing to friends ok

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,889
I just before said that you saw

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,749
someone's computer and like and miss it

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,059
happens with everyone if you saw

00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,959
someone's computer you saw oh great how

00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,299
did you do that

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:48,529
would you please come and do it my in my

00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:50,779
own system if you use this you said ok I

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,429
am just sending you a link you go there

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:56,539
and choose the configuration and you

00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:58,369
will get your own save for future or if

00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:01,009
you have to reset your system go and

00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:04,300
reset every day you just get the same

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:07,309
system again the next day

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,610
so these are the works that I did in the

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:13,760
last year Chuseok it Malick's was one

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,929
year before his lxd and it was converted

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,900
to Alex qt

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:19,819
it takes me completely a month to do

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,439
that are you just asking me what you are

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,929
doing by not happening but it's such a

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,540
complicated process thanks to yo V he's

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:30,500
a developer and one of my mentor helped

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,420
me a lot to do this fill some color we

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,309
don't have any ply mouths team we don't

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:40,550
have any icon in the Malik's be

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:43,790
implemented that and ubiquity for have

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,100
only live root till that time but we are

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,410
be shaking the ax so he was the Malik's

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,130
developer before me he has done it just

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,450
few months ago and it's just permanent

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,580
means if you want

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,190
Malick's for you disturb you don't want

00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,200
to lie but you have if you so much for

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,059
Malik's you just have one to use Malik's

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,130
you can install it permanently on your

00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:08,690
desktop this is a screen of Malik's and

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,400
this is first light boot there you have

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,010
to click install Malik's and you get

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,100
such option you just have to go through

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:19,400
some languages date set up timezone and

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,640
you can install in your hard drive next

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:29,570
talking about extinctions Malik's system

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:32,120
log so don't look it here we usually see

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:36,140
in high school where computers have set

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:39,650
up so what happened we call students the

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:42,620
come for the lab so what what the

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,230
problems the lab in this later phase

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,620
after the students go away in the

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,620
systems

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,350
mm-hmm

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,600
the students make everything dirty they

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,450
create nonsense files on the desktop and

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,290
they change the settings everything

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,510
dirty so here is the solution yeah it is

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:08,200
all their own software so here is the

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,600
solution marriage system lock the

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,110
maintainer of the lab will freeze the

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,760
system in a state as soon as you click

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,800
on the freeze it will East it will

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,040
freeze in the register the person come

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,730
the student came he will do what are the

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,980
nonsense stuff you want to do again a

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,250
student Wed do use the step make the

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,070
thing dirty then just the maintainer has

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,340
to reboot the system it will go again to

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:41,950
the state from which it was freezes the

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,620
solution presented great the second

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,620
exchange this is the screen of that that

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,860
is the system lock freeze unfreeze if

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,750
you wanted to unfit this you can

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,940
unfreeze at that time or reboot will

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:59,370
unfreeze automatically freezer system in

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,370
some state Alex QT the desktop yeah

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:11,480
yeah that depends upon your requirement

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:15,290
if if you want currently you have to do

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,179
it manually per computer you can change

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,520
the source code for yourself and

00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,380
automatically get freezes but at what

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,220
time do you want to get freeze that's

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:29,690
the thing then after unfading it will

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:33,530
take you to the same state so this is

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:39,740
Alex QT desktop the second is the MU

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:47,919
doublet by harsh okay who our Linux

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:59,410
users here Debian I'm going inside haha

00:20:47,919 --> 00:21:09,140
Ubuntu okay Fedora Arch oh cool Gentoo

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:12,460
elephant okay okay okay good so if a

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:16,190
fedora person we use it just young and

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:19,220
you gave them a debian our Ubuntu and

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,169
you asked them to install something what

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,820
will you do you have to go there and if

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,500
you want to install git you have to

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,580
search for the command to install git

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,529
app to get it stopped

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,140
which who knows about one software set

00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:37,120
of computers with us

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,120
for the journey okay

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,290
okay so this is quite different

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:55,580
you just have to type whatever you want

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:58,310
means the way to install git in fedora

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,130
the stipend in a Debian you know

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:04,100
you went to the type the command of

spread among many

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,700
and I think it's very important to get a

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,790
feedback loop to your to get your

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,090
