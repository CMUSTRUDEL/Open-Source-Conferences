An internet kiosk is a special use case. A single computer is shared by an indefinite number of users. Lots of security concerns arise. In Asia and elsewhere multiple non-latin languages have to be supported. We decided to create a custom lightweight distribution Meilix and a generator web app that allows you to preconfigure an ISO with the wallpaper and desktop settings in place.
