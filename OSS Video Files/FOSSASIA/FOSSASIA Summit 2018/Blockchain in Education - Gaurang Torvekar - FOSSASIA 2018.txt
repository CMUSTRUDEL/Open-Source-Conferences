this one

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,680
yep

00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:26,540
hello hey good morning guys

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,040
thanks Bochum thanks for coming over

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,930
today so I'm go wrong and today I'm

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,140
going to talk about blockchain in

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,989
education so you know when you speak

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,809
about blockchain the first thing that

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:45,950
comes to mind is the beginning which was

00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:49,760
Bitcoin and blockchain has primarily

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,260
been used in financial applications when

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,620
you say blockchain even people even

00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,280
include blockchain in the FinTech space

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,810
but we add a torus and endorse you know

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,540
when we started the company we thought

00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,059
let's use blockchain in a non-financial

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,040
application and that's what we have been

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,850
doing from the last two two-and-a-half

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,940
years we have been using blockchain in

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,880
education today I am going to tell you

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,979
about my journey through a torus and

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,690
indoors so I have been I am the

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,090
co-organizer of the etherium Singapore

00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,760
Meetup I have seen the blockchain and

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,950
etherium community in Singapore grow

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,610
from like four to five people which was

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,619
back in 2015 to hundreds of people like

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,530
thousands of people right now any given

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:42,590
meetup in the city you get at least 100

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,290
200 people just in one day and if you

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,360
have people like Vitalik coming here

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,400
it's like fully crowded like you had to

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,810
push people out it's like that crazy

00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,000
nobodies yeah without further ado let me

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,060
start with my presentation so yeah I am

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,159
go wrong I'm the CEO and co-founder of

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:06,020
endorse so let me start this through my

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,340
the first first blockchain company

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:13,000
called a torus so at a torus we were

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,799
working on smart contracts as a service

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,530
so you must have heard about SAS models

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:21,739
right software as a service we gave it a

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,720
little spin and we came up with s CAS

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,900
which was smart contracts as a service

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,400
so you know I I started this company

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,970
back in January 2016 you know and before

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,650
that

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,290
had actually put my prenup on the

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,300
blockchain as well so I'm one of the

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,590
first few people I'm the first guy in

00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,060
the world to put my prenup on the

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,560
blockchain people have put their

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,960
marriage certificates on the blockchain

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,850
so I thought how can I be different how

00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,190
can I be innovative so I put my prenup

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,990
it was not a legal legal document anyway

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,880
it was like a funny document like you

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,270
have to go on a date every 15 days and

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,160
she will watch you know Walking Dead

00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:03,950
with me only when I watch Seinfeld with

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:08,150
her I hate Sanford so we started a

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,280
Taurus what are we doing at a Taurus to

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,390
tell you that I'll show you a

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,850
certificate so this is BA degree

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,080
Bachelor of Arts degree of my co-founder

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,330
David Moskowitz very valuable degree in

00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,330
psychology and that helps in locked-in

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:31,370
rate psychology doctrine very very

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:35,000
connected and this is his MBA from the

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:40,269
same University so now if you look at

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,269
these two certificates what do you see

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,750
the second one is a fake certificate and

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:54,090
David could do that in 20 minutes in

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:57,500
Photoshop this is a problem not only at

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,780
a Taurus but it's a worldwide problem

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,930
the Prime Minister of Moldova faced a

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,689
scandal the CEO of Yahoo had some

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,560
falsified a resuming even at home in

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:14,099
Singapore I DEA has faced this problem

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,400
several times so we have been speaking

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,190
with universities employers companies

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,340
throughout the last two years and this

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,340
problem exists in the industry you know

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,259
across the industry I would see so some

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,889
big companies some big software

00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,539
companies or even banks they have a team

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,180
of people sitting back in India

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:39,419
Bangladesh countries like that where

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,220
they just do background checks on the

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,250
new candidates on the new employees that

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,830
they're hiring and people spend so much

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,190
money so much manpower so much you know

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,979
time on that so we thought let's solve

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:57,510
this problem how can we solve this

00:04:52,979 --> 00:05:00,750
problem answer is digital certificates

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,380
on the blockchain so we have walked with

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,470
neon Polytechnic in Singapore we did a

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,430
pilot with them last year they issued

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,479
more than 500 diplomas on the blockchain

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,659
they didn't issue all of them it was a

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,979
small pilot for a small batch but this

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:22,830
was in production we actually shoot the

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,870
diplomas to them this was done in-house

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,280
in neon I can't go into much details

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,510
about that but the idea is that the

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,330
digital certificate we take the

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,370
certificate we hash the certificate and

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,530
I put that hash into a blockchain

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,789
transaction which goes to a smart

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:44,009
contract in that way you can see that

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,500
this certificate was issued to this

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,240
person at this point of time so you have

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,240
like a digital signature on the

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,510
certificate which can be proven trust

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,660
Leslie people can directly look at the

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,240
blockchain they

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,700
and see who initiated this transaction

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,530
they can even match the hash of the

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,360
certificate with the hash in the

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,050
transaction so now if you look back at

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:11,370
David's certificate so this was the

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,840
original certificate right so this hash

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,270
the half of this certificate will go

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,850
into the transaction on the blockchain

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,560
so next time when David makes a small

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,040
change in this certificate you just

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:28,180
change the MBA the name of the course

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,890
and the date when David does this the

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,230
hash of the certificate will change as

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,680
you all very well know and this hash

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:42,370
won't match the hash in the blockchain

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:44,710
so that's how we did it neon so when we

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:48,910
were working with neon Polytechnic over

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:52,120
the last year one of the KPIs was that

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:57,310
this these certificates these digital

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,110
diplomas go to be put on LinkedIn so

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,320
when we started the project it was fine

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,120
we the students could do it but as I was

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,630
developing the product link then

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,300
suddenly changed their api's they

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,880
changed the UX UI and it was not so easy

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,620
to actually put the certificates on

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,570
LinkedIn the links on LinkedIn because

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,330
now the students had to do two or three

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,030
other steps additional steps and that

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,480
set me back by at least 15 to 20 days in

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,840
the project that made me think that I

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:33,630
started thinking like why are we giving

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,430
all our data to these monolithic giants

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,900
you you might know about it yesterday it

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,780
happened with Facebook there's a big

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,880
movement going on called delete facebook

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,200
delete Instagram chimeras analytic all

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,780
these things are happening in the world

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,850
this is just happening right now but we

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,460
we we thought about it last year we're

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,260
like why are we giving all our data why

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:58,690
are we giving the control over data to

00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:01,960
these people secondly these people these

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,940
companies they monetize your data every

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,740
click you do every light you do every

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,440
share you do on Facebook Instagram

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,969
anything any any network you're making a

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,479
lot of

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,229
on us for them but as a user what do you

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,039
get out of it

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:20,549
nada unless you are a big influencer on

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,099
Instagram and you have hundreds of

00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:24,449
thousands or millions of followers you

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,519
don't get anything out of it

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,110
you know these influencers they actually

00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,999
get paid for every tweet or every

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,969
Instagram story but a normal user

00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:36,779
nothing and third thing is about

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:38,639
verifications so you know working with

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,479
neon working with these universities

00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:45,269
these certifications you know we started

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,319
thinking that certificates are

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:48,449
definitely important

00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:50,819
you know credentials your degrees are

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:55,800
definitely important but I think what is

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:58,110
more important is your skills because

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,879
right now actually Rick our engineering

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,930
manager is here we were just discussing

00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,110
last week Stack Overflow made a survey

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,490
over the last I think one or two months

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,670
100,000 developers participated in that

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,399
survey and one of the really interesting

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,779
findings is that each developer we have

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,360
our developers here as well each

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,540
developer even I am a developer we learn

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,290
something or a lot of things outside our

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,699
school or university so we are a breed

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,439
of people who constantly keep learning

00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:33,269
we always keep developing you always

00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:34,949
keep learning new things and most of

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,529
those things don't have a certification

00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,420
actually so now Coursera sometimes gives

00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,069
you your certificates but most of the

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,740
things that you learn as a developer

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:47,370
don't have a certificate they cannot be

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:52,529
validated and that's where indorse comes

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:56,089
in so as a developer so let's let's take

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:59,339
a story of a developer called Alice

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,889
Alice has been a Java developer for

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,620
seven to eight years she has been

00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:07,800
working in a good company she is doing

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,360
well in her career but now she hears

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,759
about blockchain and she knows that

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,360
blockchain developers get paid more than

00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,529
Java developers in most cases that's a

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,120
tomb that we are looking for developers

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,610
literally

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,460
yeah so unless Alice wants to come in

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,850
the blockchain now right so Alice starts

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,950
learning about blockchain she goes to

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,900
all these websites like blog geeks she

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:36,400
reads the etherium Bitcoin white paper

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,890
and she learns about blockchain but

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,240
still she can't come to endorse and say

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,340
that hey go run give me a job as a

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,590
blockchain developer because I don't

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:49,750
know that Alice knows about blockchain

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:51,370
how do i how does she proved herself so

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,510
at that time she could come on to

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,490
endorse she could get validated and she

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,170
could get a job we will go through the

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,440
story of Alice as I go through this

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:07,030
presentation

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:11,650
so at Endor we are building a like a

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:13,330
digital backpack so with a torus we were

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,030
putting digital certificates

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,840
certificates on the blockchain within

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:22,000
doors we are going much beyond that it's

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,090
not just about one certificate but it's

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,310
about entire journey of your life your

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,730
entire skills which can be put onto the

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,490
blockchain

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,650
now I imagine if we have a system where

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,950
all your certificates starting right

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,840
from your old levels to your bachelor's

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,030
to your masters to your PhDs and

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,830
everything that you do outside of that

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,140
like your core server certificates your

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,480
Khan Academy certificates any other

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,730
MOOCs that you take any other blockchain

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,710
things that Alice learns if all of that

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,290
could be in a digital backpack like this

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,360
it could be put on the blockchain in a

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,340
very favorable manner in a manner which

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,190
way in which it cannot be tampered with

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,100
and employers can look at all of that

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,480
that would be so awesome

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,270
as a developer I would be really proud

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
to show off my achievements and that's

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,510
what we are building you that's what we

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,400
are enabling so we are doing all of this

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,610
on the scale validation everything in a

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:22,540
decentralized manner the focus of

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,820
indoors is about skills validation the

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,080
data ownership data monetization it

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,870
actually comes through the blockchain

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,310
stack we are not just using aetherium

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,360
blockchain we are using the entire

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,130
blockchain stack

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,450
you know it's great speaking in a

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,540
developer conference because you guys

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,769
actually understand what I'm saying so

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,540
we are using the entire stack right

00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,149
starting right from the authentication

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,870
at the top level we are doing that using

00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:49,360
decentralized technologies like you port

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:51,760
Civic err bits which is also called edge

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,089
wallet below that we have the blockchain

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,740
layer layer so if you're in blockchain

00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,709
we are using smart contracts for

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,079
actually validating the skills keeping a

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,959
record of all the transactions it's like

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,880
a ledger essentially below that we are

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,320
also using or decentralized database

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,649
like big chain DB we might be using blue

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,899
cell as well when they are ready and we

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:20,529
are doing our data store like file

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,750
storage on ipfs so now this is really

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:28,300
interesting guys because this entire

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:30,430
thing is called the web 3 stack and you

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,560
know being afraid of having a hyperbola

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,410
or what I am what we believe in what we

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,930
think is that the web 3 stack is

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,620
actually replacing the entire internet

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,410
stack right now so you could you could

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,449
you know compare the etherium locks you

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,430
in with your servers with your logic

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:51,670
because aetherium is a turing-complete

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:55,420
block seen on your logic sits there it

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,360
acts kind of like your server you have

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,820
decentralized database databases which

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,709
can actually replace the existing

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,920
centralized database and you have things

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:10,060
like IP FS which can actually replace

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,550
Amazon s3 in a sense and that is what we

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:16,089
are doing and thats how users have full

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,040
control over the data so on indoors

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,430
right now you can go and log in using

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,050
air bits which is a wallet on your

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,420
mobile it's a blockchain wallet on your

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,120
mobile so now imagine it it's so awesome

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,250
that you can actually authenticate on

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,949
indoors using your aetherium public

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,690
private key pairs so right through the

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:37,000
stack starting right at the

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:41,380
authentication layer till the bottom

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,420
blockchain layer so database layer your

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:49,680
keys actually control your data

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:51,380
and that's really awesome the second

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,080
part which is about data monetization

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,880
that is achieved through a token model

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,520
so I didn't das we did an icy or last

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,530
year which was in August September we

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,730
raised about 9 million at the time and

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,800
we have a IND token so what we do is we

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,050
reward the users from the platform for

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,320
their activity so the more active you

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,890
are the more rewards you get in the form

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,930
of IND tokens and those IND tokens come

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,510
back in the platform as a loop because

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,380
our revenue it comes in the form of IND

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,300
tokens and it's not just it's like kind

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,160
of like Google rate so Google or

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,840
Facebook or LinkedIn they have a credit

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,970
systems rate so you have to buy Google

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,880
credits to actually advertise on Google

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,070
or to buy linkdin credits so it's kind

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,290
of similar in indoors such that you need

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,320
to buy the endorse tokens to actually

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,180
advertise or participate and endorse as

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,060
a company as a business all these things

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,770
that's what we are working but the most

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,540
interesting part and that's where I want

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,080
to spend my time today is about the

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,570
skills validation so we have multiple

00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,030
levels of skills validation so now let's

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,380
come back to the example of Alice that

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:06,900
we were talking about earlier so Alice

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,330
knows Java now she's learning blockchain

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,370
but how do other people know how do you

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:15,830
guys know that she knows about

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:19,740
blockchain so she comes on in doors she

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,660
talks with AI chat BOTS so we have a a a

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,250
chat pod we have a blockchain 101 chat

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,560
board you can go on in doors and check

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,940
out or join our telegram channel she

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,070
chats with the blockchain chat

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,960
blockchain one-on-one chat board this

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,220
chat board it will ask her very simple

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,710
questions basic questions about

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,490
blockchain like what is mining what is

00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:40,350
proof of work what is the 51% attack and

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,270
frankly if she can't answer these

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,060
questions she doesn't know anything

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,710
about blockchain you need to know what

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,530
is mining who should claim that you know

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,240
blockchain right so Alice does takes

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,770
this questionnaire blockchain 101 chat

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,330
bot she gets a badge on her profile

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,050
which actually shows that she has passed

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,420
this test

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,999
and she has done she knows a little bit

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,750
about blockchain but still she can't go

00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:10,380
and get a job because company's in the

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,299
ICU space they want there are three

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,329
companies right now they want a really

00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,740
experienced blockchain developer

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:22,049
application developer with an experience

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:25,079
of more than ten years right so what

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,730
happens is Alice goes back now she knows

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,710
a little bit about blockchain she can

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,809
start studying more so she can start

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,760
writing smart contracts you can start

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,529
writing doing some consulting projects

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,299
that's our journey right we have all of

00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:38,460
us have gone through this journey you're

00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,890
making it easier for you by the way she

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,390
starts writing smart contracts she

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,909
starts doing some small consulting

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,710
projects she starts helping some ICO

00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:48,179
companies who are doing i ciose to

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,740
actually write the smart contracts

00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,529
ordered them or help them with the

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,070
security requirements now she has a

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:58,559
repository with actual smart contracts

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:01,220
she can come back on in doors and she

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,960
goes through crowd-sourced validation

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,720
now this crowd-sourced validation is

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,179
really interesting it has a lot of game

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,070
theoretical aspects to it so what

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,110
happens is when iris comes from the

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,539
platform and she claims that she knows

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,520
about smart contracts so now she already

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,710
has a bank remember blockchain 101 badge

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,539
she comes back and she claims that she

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,389
knows about blockchain she can write

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:27,179
smart contracts that's her clean so this

00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:30,240
claim will go for endorsements to

00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:32,610
multiple people on the platform so our

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,679
platform our algorithm it will find the

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,230
right people who are relevant to that

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,850
claim so it might find people who

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,010
actually know blockchain or who have

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:45,480
written smart contracts suppose it goes

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:48,299
to ten people for validation now this

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,159
this validation mechanism it works kind

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,649
of like a proof of stake algorithm in

00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,169
which the consensus threshold is really

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:57,029
high so we are looking at a 70 or 80

00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:58,230
percent threshold right now we are

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,299
testing it out in the market right now

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,149
we are looking at a 70 to 80 percent

00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,850
threshold and we also penalize the

00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:07,649
malicious actors in this case so if

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,010
there is a validator who goes on and

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:11,960
says yes yes yes or no no no no

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,970
every validation he starts getting

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,420
penalized because if you go against the

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:20,390
consensus we assume that you are acting

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,160
in a malicious manner anyway so out of

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,670
ten eight people say that hey Alice can

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,560
write smart contracts so that's when she

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,990
gets one more batch saying she's a smart

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,500
contract developer now she can go out

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,390
and get a good job so she goes and

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,770
applies for three interviews out of

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,330
those she gets selected or two of them

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,670
goes to the second round third round but

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,650
at the end she gets rejected because she

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,600
doesn't still doesn't have the expertise

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:51,230
so she could have been come back on

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,320
endorse and get validated by some

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,330
experts on the platform so we'll also

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,690
have experts from the blockchain space

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,820
we already have people like loyal ooh

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:05,330
Ben Chang who is from MIT go there our

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,970
advisors as well so these guys can then

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,150
go and validate her based on her skills

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,890
her expertise and maybe that will help

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,990
her or get one more job in the future

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,670
so that's what we are trying to do at

00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,650
endorse we have a combination of

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,320
validation mechanisms starting right

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,210
from AI to crowd-sourced mechanism your

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,100
peer review kind of thing and also

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:30,920
trusted validations like expert

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:33,860
validations jawed you know through the

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,950
story of Ellis I was trying to explain

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,200
why skills validation is important and

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,080
what are the benefits of that you could

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,510
get a job you can get recognized by the

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,280
community because you know people like

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,210
Vitalik they don't have a degree in

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,550
blockchain right but he is the best

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,350
blockchain developer in the world right

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,600
now because he created aetherium lakhtin

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,460
and that was because the community

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,860
believed in in him that was because all

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,930
of us believed in him and that was

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,760
through the core that he showed through

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,400
the papers that he wrote and through the

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,220
talks that he gave it doesn't have a

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,330
degree but still we all believe in him

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:17,810
you can show up your peers you can get

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:21,250
better and you can also earn for being

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,250
awesome joining in doors

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:30,360
so that ends my presentation we are a

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:33,720
great decentralized team walking across

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,410
London India and Singapore we get our

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,980
job done

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:52,020
but we also have fun at the same time

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:53,790
thank you any questions yes yes so we

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,790
have developers we have three developers

00:21:53,790 --> 00:22:00,270
sitting idea we have developers across

00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:02,610
London India and Singapore most of the

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,110
blockchain developers were in London we

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,420
just got our first blockchain developer

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,760
right now in Singapore we are on the

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,650
main net already so we are going in two

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,720
directions one is the skills validation

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,900
and other which I didn't talk about was

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,640
a b2b Direction company pages so that is

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,410
already on main net the skills

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,110
validation mechanism will take a little

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,370
more time because we need to figure out

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,770
some things in that like what is the

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,450
threshold for the consensus like how

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,670
many people we should have in every

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,420
validation all those things so needing

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,420
some time yeah

00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:55,110
exactly that's a great question see

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,210
that's what we are trying to address you

00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,070
know because right now I think that the

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,500
endorsement system on LinkedIn is

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,330
completely broken because I can go and

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,640
tell my friends I can go and tell my

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,770
mother other sister to actually endorse

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,590
me on LinkedIn it's actually even

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,840
happening right now that salespeople

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:15,090
sometimes they just add me on LinkedIn

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,220
when I add them I don't know that guy I

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:21,289
never seen and he just starts endorsing

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:24,059
me for all my skills and HTML SQL

00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:26,309
c-sharp I had done this like 4 years ago

00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:31,649
I haven't touched SQL because I've been

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:34,020
working on MongoDB so yeah that's what

00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,960
we are trying to address on endorse the

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,149
validators are chosen at random and

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,440
every claim needs to have validations

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:44,730
through this random set of people so you

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
can you can read more about it in my

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,130
white paper or its own indoors Lodi oh

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,360
yeah we are considering a lot of things

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,190
there are a lot of gaming theoretical

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,700
aspects to this that's what we are

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,700
trying to figure out right now so yeah

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:07,480
direction of what yeah that's the beauty

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,460
of a smart contractor it like a

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,770
certificate can be a lifelong

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,900
certificate it could even have an expiry

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,970
date and all of this is completely

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,530
transparent on the blockchain and I

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,470
think that's why blockchain adds a lot

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,470
of value in this case yes

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,470
sorry can you repeat that last part

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:50,379
yes oh sorry I am NOT available I'll

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,379
I'll take a look under thanks for that

00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:53,379
sure

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:11,039
cool any other questions yes what yes

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:14,649
but it's only in the neons this thing

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,940
private gene so priority no it's only in

00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:25,270
their campus so it cannot be accessed

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:26,710
outside the firewalls yes they are

00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,870
talking about it and we are designing

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,740
the system right now I don't know when

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,740
or how it will happen

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:38,970
yeah any last question no yes

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,830
is that the status of

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,880
hmm

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,720
and then how has it

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,970
oh yeah that's that's a great point

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,740
thanks for bringing it up so first of

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,510
all yeah I've been reading smart

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,740
contracts since the last two and a half

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,600
years I have seen the language groups

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,120
already I've seen it grow from a very

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,760
rudimentary system to much more

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,370
sophisticated system but definitely it's

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,980
nowhere close to Python or Java or

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,240
JavaScript because it takes time that is

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,100
going to take time and it's really

00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,080
complicated so you are trying to put

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,220
like a complete Turing machine on a p2p

00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:42,820
network which is not easy about the

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,890
grass limits so we have a repo so my

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,510
adviser he has a contract for skills

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,340
validation it's called open voting

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,960
protocol it uses some on chain

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,990
cryptographic mechanisms called ZK

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,650
snarks or zero knowledge proof and in

00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:02,530
that case it was running out of gas so

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:05,860
last year it was actually hitting the

00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:08,400
block gas limit in octave I think no

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,480
september/october but now with the new

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,100
launch of a theorem which is Byzantine

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:18,549
fork or Byzantine update ZK snarks are

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,150
on chain directly and that is actually

00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:23,650
helping us a lot about the second thing

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,720
which is the development environments

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,789
it's really choppy right now that's

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,429
completely true and you know writing the

00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:31,990
smart contract takes a lot of time so

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,850
the first contract that we put on the

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,340
main let it took us two months to

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,919
complete months it was really writing a

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,940
smart contract is okay it's not very

00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,309
difficult it takes around three to four

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,159
days maybe one week or two weeks but

00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:50,320
after that the testing phase takes a lot

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,480
of time because when you put the

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,520
contract on the blockchain you cannot

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,490
change it once you deploy it you cannot

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,260
change it and actually rakers working on

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,570
a gradable smart contract system right

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,270
now let's see how it works out but most

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,880
of the times it cannot be updated so the

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,100
testing takes a lot of time you have to

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,570
also do a smart contract security audit

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,169
on that and it'd be a lot of money for

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,240
that yeah the testing is the thing that

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,650
takes most of the time and then you have

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,110
to put it on the test nerd

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,910
then tested again with real people then

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,060
put it on the mean net so it's a long

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,060
process

00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,290
more loose

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:38,070
in terms of restrictions

00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:39,930
ya see I would say that having the

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,760
having the restriction is actually good

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:44,130
and there's a reason for that to avoid

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,960
spam and infinite loops on the block

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,750
field that's why we have the gas limit

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,670
in E theorem and frankly when I started

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,670
learning about blockchain and writing

00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,800
smart contracts eutherian was the only

00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:59,700
and the best option was back in January

00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,170
2016 I stuck with it I love it and I

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,880
think the community support that

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,230
aetherium has is the most important

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,760
thing there are several blockchain

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,000
implementations right now just yesterday

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,380
I was having a talk with a guy like I

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,920
want to go to this block here and like

00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,200
dude you go there but community support

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:21,510
is just not there for other projects as

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,040
much as I am I would say cool thank you

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:29,809
guys thanks for coming today

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,809
