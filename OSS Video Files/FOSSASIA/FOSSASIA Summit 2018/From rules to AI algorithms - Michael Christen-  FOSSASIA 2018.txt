Artificial Intelligence in intelligent digital personal assistants are not simple chatbots. They are driven by the deduction rules of expert systems and the principle of machine learning. In this talk we learn how this technology is used in detail using the SUSI personal assistant framework. Rules - in the context of the conversational web now called ‚skills‘ - are implemented with the combination of a backtracking system combined with cloud access to external knowledge. We will learn how a expert system-based personal assistant works and why it can be very easy to write skills for such a system.
