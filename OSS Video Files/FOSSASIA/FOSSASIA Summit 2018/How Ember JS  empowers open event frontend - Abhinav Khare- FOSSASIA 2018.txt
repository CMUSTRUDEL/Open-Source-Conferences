With the development of the API server for the Open Event project we needed to decide which framework to choose for the new Open Event front-end. With the plethora of javascript frameworks available it got really difficult to decide which one is actually the right choice. Every month a new framework arrives and the existing ones keep actively updating themselves often. We decided to go with Ember.js. This talk will cover the emberJS framework and highlight its advantages over others and  demonstrate its usefulness with some code snippets and UI screenshots  as well as  show the hands on advantage by comparing it with the way the previous frontend was structured and the extremely efficient usage of resources using json api.
