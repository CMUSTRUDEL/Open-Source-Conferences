about Malick's and I'm I'm not I did

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,650
four semesters Chinese but I'm not very

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,780
good at Chinese but I was told that

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,960
naming something like beautiful in

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,180
Chinese so I have no insights into

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,180
Chinese but maybe can give you some

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,529
insights into May leaks what does my

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,009
name is my email is my Twitter so where

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:35,899
to start maybe start here looks familiar

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,390
so you have like this typical bun - or

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:42,030
Damien's boot up screen that we

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,989
customized for May leaks you can install

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,920
the system on your hard drive you can

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:53,640
run a live CD and but that's actually

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,090
not the approach we want to take so

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,590
what's special about Malick's is not

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,750
that it's just another Linux

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,210
distribution or just another customized

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,820
Linux distribution but it basically

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,600
starts with a use case it's a desktop

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,130
application a desktop distribution so

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
very special and for a very special

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,470
purpose and the purpose is in short

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,990
think of the conference organizer like

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,330
force Asia and want to set up in the

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,509
conference space 100 Internet terminals

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,850
and there should always be the same

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,850
software on each device we have certain

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,540
requirements for public computer where

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,659
you could access the internet so in in

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,119
the center stands the use case in this

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,640
gate and we reuse all existing

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,299
technology we try not to invent too much

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,780
on our own we choose a very show so very

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,860
simple desktop environment that is Alex

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,890
Q team we reused the original build

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,890
scripts from Ubuntu before Lubuntu was

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,250
existing as a starting point

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,070
and try to really work on just these

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,410
small and feasible configuration items

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:13,600
that are relevant for our use case and

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:16,900
always try to turn development on to the

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,290
use case to satisfy the user needs for

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:24,040
this special desktop purpose and the

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,030
idea of the development is that we apply

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,800
continuous integration so we try to

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,380
every time there's a change we built the

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,320
system again and we really have this

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:40,380
kind of approach off of an agile and use

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,940
case driven development process so um

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,540
there actually there's actually not only

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,610
Malick's

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,970
but the important other two is the

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,370
mailings configurator gasps Martha this

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,730
is a very Minimum Viable Product

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:58,390
it's a web app running in container

00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,410
basically asks you for your email you

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,190
can say what's the name of the event to

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,330
pop up when you open the browser on this

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,220
customized machine I can upload the

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,130
wallpaper that's like the wallpaper of

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,920
your conference these are just examples

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,560
settings for for the proof of concept of

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,190
course we connect all the other features

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,820
necessary for configurator what happens

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,940
then

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,530
you press the build button and then yeah

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,840
then you get an email I thought but

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,000
Toronto made was ten minutes later you

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,670
get an email and this is the email with

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,250
the ISO build so you download an ISO

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,950
image and then you can install it on the

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,489
different machines and the idea here is

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,470
to keep it very simple in a way that the

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,959
person who actually creates this

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,510
customized distribution doesn't have to

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,670
care for the technical details doesn't

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,180
have to run any build scripts doesn't

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:01,180
have to know much about technology just

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,360
has this web interface and everything

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,110
else works in the background the

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,599
mailings as such where you run the build

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,650
script for the distribution yourself and

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,480
business

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,780
most similar to say what your

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,989
distributors do when they compile a new

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:27,130
release of their of their distribution

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:29,949
of the software right so what we found

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,320
important in the process and when we

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,900
evolved all the different people is to

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,740
follow the for Asia guidelines for

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,320
software development using existing

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,570
infrastructure using infrastructure that

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,840
is easy to maintain so we don't have

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,960
much administrative overload reusing

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,010
existing tools like using jitter for

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,289
communications

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,260
it's just simple because we can use it

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,470
as a as an external service you straight

00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,419
up

00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,729
for the back trackers and so on so we

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:04,539
don't have to maintain any

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:10,360
infrastructure and yeah to try to at

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:15,820
least this was a stage where we always

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:19,030
built and what stuff directed the other

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,789
point was when we had our students

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,570
working on the project and they solve

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:27,880
tiny tasks always encouraged them to

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,240
document how they solved it what they

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,699
did and writing blog posts and we found

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,630
it in the Goutham of code process very

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,520
very important to encourage people when

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,260
they contribute code when they sent a

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,289
pull request also to write blog posts

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,449
about what they did and how they solved

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,760
it what alternatives they considered

00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,500
because this is very fruitful and we

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,680
discovered that the students that were

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,810
very good at writing code were also the

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
ones that were very good at writing blog

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,060
posts surprisingly because the serotype

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,729
at least in Europe or in Germany is

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,919
either you're good coder are you good at

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:10,539
documentation button and of course Asia

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,690
is fear it's a bit different so and the

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,539
third thing as an observation from the

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,180
mailings project which is a bit like

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:23,830
like a training ground also for our

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,189
developers from India mostly is that we

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,259
found it very important

00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:32,330
with a larger team to just walk through

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:36,159
the code too much legacy code from 2012

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:39,020
and look what is it actually about and

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:43,819
walk through the code together jointly

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:47,090
and using teleconferences and just

00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:49,069
trying to improve our common

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,560
understanding of what's going on and

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:55,689
what may be obsolete and what's actually

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,729
applicable so here are some links

00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:03,620
there's they're like three repositories

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,639
one is for the May leaks the Malik's sh4

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,300
for building it

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,639
these are simple shell scripts that pull

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,599
together the packages they open up

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,400
chroot where some some other software

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,879
gets installed and some configuration

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,770
happens and then we have in the mail

00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,300
it's the generator branch that's

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,800
important for four generation of this

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,750
taking this this image for the for the

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,229
mailings generator then we have two web

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,080
app that's also exported the Malick's

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:39,439
generator as a separate repository and

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,289
the third one that was worked not last

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,389
year but the the year even before it's

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,819
the mailing system block because when

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,800
you have a desktop that you provide to a

00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,229
general audience what you want is you

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,599
want to lock the system down so that all

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,639
the casual users that are coming was

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,649
there different to requirements that

00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,949
different interests the different

00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:05,599
languages and so on cannot destroy the

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:08,539
computer or play eruptive wave so and

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:13,479
main discussion takes place on a jitter

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:16,849
channel in in the first a just a leaks

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,849
so how will we continue with the

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:24,050
Malick's project Taran will go more into

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:27,620
details one of our developers but soon

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,629
but I think for for projects I would say

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,199
could be singled out and are relevant

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:36,110
for the upcoming google Summer of Code

00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:37,089
season and one is the roadblock project

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,279
like

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,949
you know it's more or less experimental

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,610
code it's not very beautiful code in any

00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:48,160
way or maybe partly because it's a

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,069
configuration tasks not too much code at

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,199
all but one of the roadblock projects is

00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:59,620
of course we have used these old scripts

00:08:53,199 --> 00:09:02,319
from 2012 quite useful to put this into

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,589
productive use - yeah

00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:07,300
migrate everything to 64-bit this is now

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,100
standard and we have to do some

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,899
modifications there so someone has to

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,589
work on that and there are also some

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:17,529
some other blocking projects like how to

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:21,040
kill desktop notifications and other

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:23,589
details the second project is something

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,089
something new we want to do based on

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,639
Malick's but it doesn't matter whether

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,939
it's the target platform is Malick's or

00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,620
just an ordinary lubuntu with with xqt

00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:34,449
but Malick's is like the reference

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,029
platform for it and this is zeusie

00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:40,420
desktop integration you had all these

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:42,100
talks about Suzy and me hey Kristin can

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,089
explain you the details on the

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,069
conversational server and all the

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:50,199
different clients that are right now

00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:52,660
available but what we don't have yet is

00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:57,370
something in the Linux space comparable

00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:01,379
to Microsoft Cortana for Windows like

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:04,839
desktop integration of conversational

00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:07,269
features and this also cannot totally

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,679
protests on on the server because all

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:12,339
the different all the clients are

00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:17,319
different so we have some kind of API to

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:19,569
steer some desktop specific options by

00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:22,420
with the conversation of the interface

00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:25,629
and provide some interface to get

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,170
feature parity with Siri with Alexa and

00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:31,569
so on so all the hard work all the stuff

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,059
in the background was the Suzy AI server

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:36,459
is basically done but now we have to put

00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,259
it more into use and support the

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:40,420
client-side features and this is what

00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:42,999
this project is about and we hope to get

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,470
a sum of code student who want to work

00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:49,120
specifically on desktop integration so

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,720
the end the third project of course is

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,300
to

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,270
and expand the Malick's generator now

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,910
that the basic say if you if you know

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,850
how to configure the wallpaper then you

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,730
can also configure everything else this

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,980
done becomes pretty trivial so we want

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,370
to expand the features and make this new

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,170
more useful and there's an idea because

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,070
right now the build process is pretty

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:18,100
pretty ugly using a bit of a hackers

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:22,090
shell script to use a next-generation

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:26,650
that build process and this is prototype

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:30,310
by harsh in his Fork of the Malick's

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:33,130
main repository so I just had a look at

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,190
it I don't I don't know I haven't tested

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,400
it and I don't know how much work it

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,890
would be to actually make it work and

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,070
the seemingly replacement but this looks

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:50,130
like the way to go from a technical side

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,130
so maybe you

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,900
so huh oh yeah good

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,160
why desktop when everyone's moving to

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:11,420
the phone that's that's actually good

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,760
point I would say that the desktop still

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,399
has a place the desktop is still

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,870
important I mostly use the desktop for

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,790
for interactions and I am aware of the

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,149
mobile hype I'm aware of the mobile

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,860
integration but still say the Linux

00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,680
desktop is something that never happened

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,529
and the closest approximation to a

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,570
system that works out of the box is

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,820
actually from my perspective to go

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:41,329
simple and we did it a few years ago

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:46,450
when we started with this LXDE project

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:47,690
and try to try to gather more

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,110
improvements

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,480
go into complexities that just provides

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,560
basic functionality and you say okay

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,459
this is like a drop-in replacement

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,050
because right now public administrations

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,089
they are not going to tablets they're

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,760
still using desktop computers and they

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,040
will continue to do so for all their for

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,750
other services but say public

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,029
administrations they were considering to

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,360
switch to Linux and it was a time where

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:17,240
I could say yeah let's try it let's do

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,850
it let's migrate to Linux but right now

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,350
you cannot say this anymore at least I

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,750
wouldn't say I wouldn't recommend a

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:27,200
public administration to switch to Linux

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,360
on the desktop simply because these

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,089
desktop environments are too complex not

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,070
stable enough and we had some say

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:38,260
migrational disasters so other you

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:45,490
software gets completely outdated or or

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:48,620
yeah useless or yeah unstable and and

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,250
dysfunctional so I I'm using that that's

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,040
Linux desktop for for eight years almost

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,290
20 years now and I'm very satisfied with

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,250
it but I don't know if I would recommend

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,459
it to someone else

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,160
so what's really important is to keep it

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:07,269
very focused and in a way say for me the

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,420
perfect for me the perfect desktop is

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:13,769
like like the perfect servant a perfect

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,019
servant as a servant

00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,899
that you don't even notice you just see

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,399
oh there's a glass of water exactly in

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,199
the moment when I want this glass of

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,300
water and when you talk too much about

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,670
the desktop and are too concerned about

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,439
all the features and so on and note even

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,829
notice the desktop then something

00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:36,230
something goes wrong but I I guess say

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:38,369
for for general user who's also

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,489
experienced in this Microsoft's fear I

00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:45,420
think Alexa QT is is quite good

00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:48,389
approximation as a desktop so this is a

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:52,819
software I would right now recommend or

00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:52,819
ought to go with cinnamon of course

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,510
[Music]

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,839
would you recommend that we use this

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,990
ourselves at all

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,440
if there are very serious concerns 1

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,440
then is

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,160
reconcile things like brought for my

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,759
flight drivers and videography you drive

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,759
grah

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:27,320
but the reason why I'm asking Pez I

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:29,810
actually have a disability and almost

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,560
everything had to be installed

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,220
why come online there was not

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:39,600
single life

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,600
if I wanted to say go - hi - hola

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:47,500
nothing that could be

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,500
so amusing

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:54,740
right I I guess this is a general the

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:59,810
general question that applies to all

00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:02,060
Linux distributions in a way some some

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,690
some other friendly some work out of the

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,290
box sometimes don't work out of the box

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,459
personally I think if I can get some

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,850
command-line solution it's it's better

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:16,940
for me I don't want any graphical

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,040
installers or so simply because when you

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,350
think of a support context when you

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,990
support a user and tell them how to

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,300
install the driver and you you just give

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,670
him given the instructions for the

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,579
command line it's something like okay

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,279
use this shortcut fire up a terminal and

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:38,360
enter these three commands and what will

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:41,089
be the output or you type in this

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,940
command what what does it show to you

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,029
this is good for good for interaction

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:50,529
for poor customer support but if you

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:54,290
have graphical interfaces I mean try to

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:56,540
explain your mom on the telephone and

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,180
then you have to click the button there

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,380
in the menu or so and so it's really

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:06,400
it's it's horror to to do to do remote

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,319
support on graphical user interfaces and

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,040
solving all the issues so personally I

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:16,250
prefer very much the idea of grant line

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:21,260
interfaces for configurations if there

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:23,620
has to be something configured yeah the

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,620
other

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:33,610
and regarding the sale of hardware I

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:38,230
mean this is not genuine to the platform

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:40,990
I would say if you buy a computer in a

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,090
shop with Windows pre-installed then

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,460
it's in a responsibility of the hardware

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,700
manufacturer to make it run on that

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:52,539
machine and it probably works because it

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:58,240
shipped with it okay on the other hand

00:17:52,539 --> 00:18:00,400
eye problems when you run older hardware

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,799
when you run hardware that's not

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,200
certified for your machine or that was

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,120
certified for the previous reason for

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,020
the previous machine especially when you

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,870
try to use older printers with newer

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,730
machines at times the printer

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,100
manufacturers they don't want to support

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,429
the new operating system and you run

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:26,620
into troubles and just an example of

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:30,460
from my practice say I wrote I got

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:33,070
Bluetooth headphones so you cannot

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:37,059
operate them under Windows 10 you cannot

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:39,309
operate them with Mac OS and with Linux

00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:41,650
it was very hectic and complicated to

00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:43,299
get it get it work but now it works and

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,740
then there was a kernel update and now

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:50,260
it works seemingly out of the box so so

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,110
I guess that the Linux approach still is

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:57,900
the best because you have such a variety

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,900
and such a richness of hardware support

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,800
the point with Malick's is that our

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,140
users shouldn't have to do anything with

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,170
system configuration so if if this

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,720
system doesn't work on on a box that we

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,910
put somewhere then there's a problem

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,120
with this box so then we cannot proceed

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,670
with this but this is just just use case

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,620
for for development

00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,900
I wouldn't recommend right now to use

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,500
Malick's for productive reasons in any

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,680
way but thinking about the use case

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,440
working on the use case means thinking

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,140
about in this specific context what do

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,360
users need like when you have this photo

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,070
conference space then you come up with

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,050
different requirements that you usually

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,670
don't have like support of multiple

00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,140
languages if you have an international

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,260
conference some speakers will be

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,350
Japanese some will be Chinese so we have

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,410
to have Japanese and Chinese out of the

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,750
box and the next person that comes is a

00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,700
Spanish citizen so these are very

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:02,420
special requirements or maybe you want

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:05,330
to block certain websites and her block

00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,820
list so they don't use your conference

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,390
space to access certain websites that

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,520
may be inappropriate in a in the context

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,370
you wouldn't have wouldn't want to have

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,410
this at home of course but say in a

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,970
conference space I understand that there

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:23,420
should be some blocking of some services

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:26,240
and so on so very deriving from the use

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:30,350
case what do we need in order not to

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:35,900
confuse users in order not to create too

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:39,920
much overhead technically Malick's is

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,640
right now I know that there's some some

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,970
in the projects were very much into our

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,600
Linux but it's basically built on on a

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:53,450
debian or bond to infrastructure so we

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,090
don't even we don't even take our own

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,730
kernel so we even take the Punto kernel

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,440
which technically isn't even make it a

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,060
distribution

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,890
because if you don't compile your own

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,250
kernel then there's no distribution as

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,830
you know but that that's not a real case

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,990
the real case is the use case and to

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,330
trying to develop all the configurations

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,600
so everything thing get things get set

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:20,810
up out of the box and the special needs

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,200
of the user are satisfied here and yeah

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,910
why not why not a mobile phone actually

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,290
say in this conference basis where you

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:33,500
have like this Internet terminals or in

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,720
a hotel this was the other use case

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,240
Malick's was previously called who tell

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:44,720
us so the idea was yet to create a

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:46,730
distribution for for for hostels and for

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,960
these purposes so a but but it's

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:53,650
basically the same the device the

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,160
desktop that it's accessed by multiple

00:21:53,650 --> 00:22:02,740
persons temporarily persons who don't

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:07,250
own the computer persons who just use it

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:10,250
for its and want to leave no traces

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:13,040
there you have to provide some security

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,220
and and so on and the settings shouldn't

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:23,320
confuse users in any way so no pop-ups

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:23,320
in in Chinese and no

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:32,000
hello yeah many leaks I didn't know what

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:36,590
it was about a thing and missing some of

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:52,090
the context okay yeah maybe maybe

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:57,100
Tarun can get get into the details yeah

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,100
registering as the Debian derivative

00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:04,940
we have some forms captain reduced there

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,940
you run your own repository as well or

00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:10,019
well yeah the software is right now

00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:13,289
mostly in experimental stage but we have

00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:15,299
say dedicated packages of course but

00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:17,519
they some of them don't adhere to the

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,769
the Debian standards yet as someone

00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:26,369
pointed out so we also have to work on

00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:33,570
that no you know we don't want that but

00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:35,909
we have to discussion yeah but but

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,580
actually I guess right now we have no no

00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:40,649
users other than the developers because

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,679
yeah we were still working on this

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:46,049
project for also as a kind of

00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,889
educational project or for trying out

00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:53,789
some some stuff how to build build from

00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:57,299
from an app using automated services

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,690
building ISO images and that's that's

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:02,780
kind of the fun

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:06,850
yeah I do not sorry do you want to talk

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,850
with me afterwards yeah yeah

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,720
okay so

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:18,270
