Why should you use Kubernetes, an Istio Service Mesh or any choreographed Microservice architecture? There is the efficiency argument, scaling, time to market. There is the isolation argument, resilience. But in this talk, we share a different perspective: Our systems are becoming polyglot, intelligent, and rapidly moving towards an evolutionary mode where machine learning is a natural collaborator in the design thinking and coding process. Let’s play with that idea.
