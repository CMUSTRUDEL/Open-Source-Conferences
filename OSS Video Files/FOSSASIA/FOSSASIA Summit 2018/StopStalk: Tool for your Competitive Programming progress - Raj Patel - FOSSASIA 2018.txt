Since the launch of the website, there has been an increased traction about the concept amongst the competitive programmers that StopStalk (https://www.stopstalk.com/) has provided to them. StopStalk not only helps in analysing your own competitive programming progress but also helps to code and learn collectively with your friends. Along with the features that are provided on StopStalk I want to discuss the implementation details that are going on in the background to serve the beautified data on the website. The code is completely open source on Github https://github.com/stopstalk/stopstalk-deployment.Â 

Also want to portray how the processing of data is done as the size of the dataset is tremendous and increasing day by day.
