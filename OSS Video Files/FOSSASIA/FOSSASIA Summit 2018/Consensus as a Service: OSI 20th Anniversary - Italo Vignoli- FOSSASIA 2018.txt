	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:10,710
morning everyone welcome and the we are

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,830
celebrating but I think that more than

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,890
celebrating I think we we can go over

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,300
some of the highlights of these 20 years

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:25,590
and see how the next 10 years can look

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,269
like looking at some of the trends that

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,669
are affecting or affected by open source

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:37,940
during the last few years so of course

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:43,920
open source was born after free software

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:46,800
the reality is that it was born based on

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,030
free software the we all know the issue

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,460
that free as in English because you have

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,850
the free as in freedom and free as in

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,120
beer that is terrible in term of

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,629
marketing because you always have the

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:09,049
issue of explaining which free you are

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:12,840
talking about and so what happen is that

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:14,580
Richard Stallman created free software

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,780
developed the concept of free software

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,320
it was a mixture of Technology and

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,689
ethics and freedom and many things which

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,189
we all absolutely share and respect

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:33,659
unfortunately was not good for marketing

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,369
was not good for to make free software

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:41,220
to eff free software in enterprises

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:43,680
enterprise have their own buzzwords they

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,159
have their own agenda they have their

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,049
own vocabulary and free is not a right

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:55,470
word for the corporations so bruce

00:01:52,049 --> 00:02:01,340
perens together with a bunch of other

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:06,600
people met in early 1998

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:09,509
in Silicon Valley and based on the four

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,640
main freedom use study

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:18,780
improve share and on a number of other

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:21,810
rules that have been inserted distilled

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,099
in the open source definition they are

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,040
ten different rules created the concept

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:32,400
of open source and according to what he

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,530
has recently written open source was a

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,849
kind of marketing campaign for free

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,730
software was not anything different

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:44,129
unfortunately there has been

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,510
misunderstanding and I think we all

00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:53,519
should avoid these misunderstandings

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:56,730
because the division between free

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,370
software and open source I still have

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,409
been I'm still as to why you are a

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,269
director of open source that means that

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:07,620
you are not for free software which i

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:10,409
think is just as idiot question we are

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,239
all for free software we are for open

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,280
source software open source is a

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,340
precondition of free software if you

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,060
don't have to you the the code on an

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,519
open source

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,560
you cannot basically have free software

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:29,220
so we have to overcome the any kind of

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,590
division we have to work together to

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,430
make free and open source or whatever

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,840
you call it but we know the principles

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:42,870
success not only amongst developers

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:47,370
where is definitely a success and the

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:50,670
recent move of Microsoft from Linux as a

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,220
cancer - we love Linux is just based on

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,549
the fact that developers definitely

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,830
prefer Linux to other platforms for

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,290
development and therefore to get

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,500
developers you have to be in the open

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,090
source environment because most of the

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,989
most dynamic most smarter developers are

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:17,160
using Linux and are not using the I

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:20,290
would say the operating system of the

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,139
last decade which is Windows

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,180
by the way people was he was telling me

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,270
I don't know when he codes I never could

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,590
I don't try the single character of code

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:36,020
but I'm Elena although I'm 63 and I got

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:41,360
my degree in literature believe it or

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:44,270
not in 1978 I'm a Linux user and when

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,970
people ask me also you were old and and

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,729
not a technical guy you can use Linux

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,060
and said you just need a new room

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,280
connected to your hands to use Linux so

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,729
if you don't use Linux this is a press

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,460
your problem is not my problem is is

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:04,400
more secure it's smarter it's

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,820
configurable I can do it whatever I want

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:13,280
I can use it and interoperate with other

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:16,520
people without any issue so let's have a

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,699
very fast look at what open-source has

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,090
been during the the first two decades so

00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:28,190
the first one of course the first one

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:31,700
was the decade of advocacy it was the

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,550
decade where people were looking at

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,380
open-source software in a skeptical and

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,690
free software of course in a skeptical

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:44,000
way they were asking and I actually

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,010
entered the open source environment in

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,960
during that decade more or less I've

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,120
been involved in open source for the

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,590
last 15 years

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:59,780
so most of the last two decades the open

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:03,560
source initiative started based on the

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:07,820
fact that the open source definition was

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:11,840
a reference for open source licenses and

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:15,070
therefore it was easier having because

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,620
if you think the four freedoms are

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,289
something that you understand once you

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,870
have started especially for the

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,310
non-technical people I can tell you what

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,490
happened to me

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,189
when I discovered OpenOffice that was my

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,399
entry point in in

00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:36,610
in a free software environment I started

00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:40,539
using of an office and then I understood

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:43,059
what the for freedom where afters having

00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:47,889
started to use the software this is the

00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:49,809
typical path of a non-technical guy the

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,800
open source definition is a lot easier

00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:56,619
to understand for non-technical people

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,379
because the four freedoms are mostly

00:06:56,619 --> 00:07:03,459
ethical and of course ethics is is

00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:07,059
extremely important but when you think

00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:08,889
about business let's say that there are

00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:12,699
a few companies around the do business

00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:18,429
are not totally ethical but they might

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:23,639
use open source as as well so OSI has

00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:26,649
been the steward of licenses has

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,379
approved a number large number of

00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:34,719
licenses during the first ten years also

00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:37,569
during the second ten years the idea is

00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:40,149
not to do the same over the next ten

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:44,919
years there are enough open source

00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:48,399
licenses for everyone you have all the

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,819
flavors if you want the if you want

00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,219
copyleft from strong to weak you have

00:07:51,819 --> 00:08:01,629
all the flavors if you want permissive

00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:04,959
from PST to Apache or whatever so let's

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:10,869
focus on some of these licenses make

00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:13,990
them mainstream and have the consensus

00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:17,829
of companies on using licenses yesterday

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:20,229
you have seen a guy from Daimler that of

00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:25,959
course is more known with the name with

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:28,959
a brand name of Mercedes and the reality

00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:32,680
that they the software that they embed

00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:35,169
on on their cars is Linux which is an

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,919
example that I usually make when I'm

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:43,219
speaking a conference and say would you

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,950
when you press the brake pedal on your

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,279
machine do you really do you still think

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:52,399
that it it actions a pump or something

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,240
like it was in the past and people says

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,120
of course and said no it sends a comment

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,750
to Linux and because it's Linux you can

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,380
be sure that the wheel will stop if it

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:10,190
was Windows hmm okay

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:14,120
let's talk about the wall where when you

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,550
have crashed in and people say but why

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,420
this and I said because that is solid

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,060
and the other one is a joke it's a joke

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:29,269
used by billions of people but it's a

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:34,640
joke anyway so the first decade there

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:42,680
were some controversy as you can see the

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:48,410
schoo battle with IBM the allowing

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:51,350
documents by Microsoft and although I am

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,720
looking with a lot of interest to what

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:57,380
Microsoft is doing

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,440
we cannot personally probably's because

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm Italian I'm old and a marketing man

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,610
so marketing man is a little bit bastard

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:11,930
inside so I will never forget that those

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:16,459
documents were published because that is

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:20,839
a significant communication in general

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:24,920
and it is not enough single we love

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:27,579
Linux to overcome that kind of

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:32,420
communication that lasted for 10 years

00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:36,170
then let's talk it about it and let us

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,540
understand how Microsoft can become a

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,590
good open source

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:47,370
community member we are for freedom of

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:50,640
course and therefore we must be coherent

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,670
with our idea so everyone is free to

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,300
become a good community member but that

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,940
is not the right way to step to start

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,560
being a community member so the first

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:07,080
term the first decade was

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:12,420
crystallization of consensus around is

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:15,630
the licences and multilateral versus

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,270
unilateral it's a little bit obscure

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,570
might be a little bit obscure but if you

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:25,280
think that open source licenses are

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:28,970
multilateral open source licenses are

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:32,160
the effect of consensus while

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,260
proprietary licenses are unilateral so

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,760
it's just it's the consensus of a cone

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,160
of a single company and of course open

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,490
source licenses created safe spaces for

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,590
developers because if you use an open

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,380
source license you stick run open source

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,360
license you have a community and you

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,730
start to have an ecosystem behind you

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,200
you have organization like free software

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:02,880
foundation OSI that are at least driving

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:06,920
the idea and making trying to make the

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,360
idea more popular you have other

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,170
organization like softer freedom

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,740
Conservancy you have organization like

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:20,400
open invention network that is working

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,320
on the side of tight ends on open source

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,450
software so we start to have an

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,810
ecosystem that all together make it

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,270
possible the development and not just

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:41,100
the development but the growth of open

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:43,380
source so open Mogollon with a very

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,990
well-known open source advocate and

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,330
lawyer says that licenses our

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:52,790
constitution for communities and if we

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:56,699
think it this is a very nice definition

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:59,790
because being one of the founders of the

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:05,610
LibreOffice project I can tell you we

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:08,670
decided to use we inherited LGPL and we

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,249
decided to move to MPL and that was

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:15,889
based on consensus and NPL today it's

00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:20,309
really the constitution of our community

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:23,369
we strongly feel that MPL is protecting

00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,029
us and is allowing libreoffice to

00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,509
flourish

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,040
so open-source license a that

00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,949
open-source licenses are the

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,379
multilateral consensus of permissions

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:42,139
and norms for a community and I really

00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:46,860
like this definition second decade 2008

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:51,899
2018 where we are now broad enterprise

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:53,939
adoption of course when you become more

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,569
popular then you have software patent

00:13:53,939 --> 00:14:04,649
patterns to come and GPL enforcement and

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:08,009
in some cases so this is the decade

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:13,559
where Microsoft from Linux is a cancer -

00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:20,569
- we love Linux open-source is the

00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:20,569
de-facto market share leader on servers

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,819
[Music]

00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:28,860
we can look at different deployment of

00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:32,939
open source software but it's rather

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,740
clear that on the cloud open source

00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:41,639
software is the absolute leader and

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:46,799
there are also other areas where open

00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:52,790
source in in different flavors is the

00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:58,100
leader we can say that that for mobiles

00:14:52,790 --> 00:15:00,839
of course iPhones and Macintosh are

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,230
closed products but the reality is that

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,790
the base of the software it's the roots

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:12,260
of that software are

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:15,300
on open source in any case so and

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,870
talking about new ventures and new

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,500
companies and new developments there is

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:25,640
open source in most of the new software

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,320
that is being developed even if you use

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,460
proprietary software like Dropbox for

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:38,190
instance you will see somewhere based on

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:42,240
open source software so and that is what

00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,770
makes me happy because if I see that is

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,830
based on open source software

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,590
I trust it more than if it was based on

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,440
proprietary software and not a developer

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,870
I cannot look into the code but I know

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,750
that there is someone doing that for me

00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,810
and helping to clean the code and make

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:06,060
the code better because the code is open

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:09,660
source so the real value of open source

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:14,910
is that you can innovate without needing

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:20,670
to be the first you can start where the

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:22,980
others have stopped and again is not and

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,990
of course I'm making many examples

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,200
related to LibreOffice because I've

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,080
lived the project for the last years but

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,900
you exactly LibreOffice started where

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,780
Open Office stopped

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:39,870
so today LibreOffice is several years

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:43,860
ahead in term of development and the

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,610
reason of this is that LibreOffice is an

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,800
independent community backed product

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:53,030
while OpenOffice companies wanted to

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:58,140
make up an office unknown independent

00:16:53,030 --> 00:17:00,570
corporate baked open-source product we

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,050
should never forget that the situation

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:10,610
of Open Office today is thanks to IBM

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:15,330
Oracle if the if the product is stuck

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:16,710
nowhere is because IBM and Oracle wanted

00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,800
to back it

00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:22,500
at first and they abandoned the product

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,610
because there was no interest when they

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,990
understood that the community was on the

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:35,520
libreoffice item you stay in control of

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:38,520
your own resources you can influence the

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,090
global ecosystem and this is the power

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,840
of open source we all together can bring

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,660
can build a better ecosystem for open

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:54,090
source software but of course we have to

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:57,480
be all together and sometimes as I don't

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,190
have up again I don't have a technical

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,290
background so forth for instance the

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,790
first time that I discovered Linux I'm

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:09,170
very curious so the first time that I

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,690
tried to install Linux was in 2002 I

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:17,340
bought a radar distribution at the time

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:21,420
was kind of 15 floppy disks I installed

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:25,050
it and at the end when I real aunch the

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:27,870
computer the screen was black so I

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:31,080
called my friend that suggested me to

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,090
installer that then and said what's now

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,350
and he said oh you have to open the

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,330
terminal and I said no way my religion

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,090
does not be allowed to use the terminal

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:47,520
so my religion does not allow me to use

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:50,580
outlook and the terminal and partially

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,930
KDE but KD I think is a problem of

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:58,830
myself as well because I I cannot get

00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:02,420
the philosophy behind KDE among KT

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:08,640
advisory board so this is alario sino

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:10,740
but I install KDE every now and then and

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,930
then after a couple of days I know no

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,820
way I cannot use it but definitely my

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,890
religion does not allow me to use

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,410
outlook and the terminal and actually

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,510
the reason why I am involved in open

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,270
source is the existence of outlook

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:30,210
outlook is the worst software ever

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,760
developed by Quadra man

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:38,980
I don't say animal because I would

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:42,460
offend more more genders so quad Romans

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,770
are only humans and monkeys so I just

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,660
offend humans and monkeys but just

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:52,450
conceiving Outlook is a sin by itself

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,300
and if you think that all the advantages

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:58,960
of open-source are derived from software

00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:04,300
freedom and new technologies are

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:07,420
possible only with open-source talking

00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:11,620
again about Mercedes the fact that they

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:14,620
are able to have a car that is software

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:18,670
driven is because they can embed an

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:22,920
operating system into a car and F the

00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:26,290
operating system manage the car

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,750
something similar is for networks today

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,900
you have software-defined networks and

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:35,380
most software-defined networks are based

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:37,660
on open source software then maybe you

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,450
have someone that because of the license

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,730
makes a proprietary version of the

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,890
operating system but the reality is that

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,220
the proprietary version of several

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:51,040
network operating system are based on

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:55,240
web based originally on open source

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:58,660
software so let's see what can or might

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:02,640
happen in in the future

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:06,970
open source next ten years we say

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:11,050
assimilation and authenticity let's talk

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:14,530
about assimilation so si as a membership

00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:18,220
or an affiliate program if you look at

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:21,490
the locals there it's kind of the who's

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:25,690
who of open source if you are

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:29,110
representing a not-for-profit a

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,700
community an open source organization

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:36,840
and you're not affiliated to si I

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:41,230
strongly advise you to join because

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,130
together we can really improve the

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,130
ecosystem

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:53,150
when I talk as a OSI representative I'm

00:21:49,370 --> 00:22:00,500
wrapped backed by all these projects and

00:21:53,150 --> 00:22:04,060
this gives me strength when I discuss

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,650
with people because I'm representing

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:10,820
operating system I'm representing

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:14,480
communities projects I'm representing

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,330
software's I'm representing the best of

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,210
the open-source and the best of free

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,330
software of course so that is extremely

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,830
important you are really invited to join

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:31,640
it's very easy there is a module on a

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:34,880
website you just fill in you will deal

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:40,900
with Patrick Masson our executive

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:45,080
director and the first meeting after

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:48,920
pantry has done the due diligence you

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:53,540
will be approved by the board and we

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:56,350
will start doing things together for

00:22:53,540 --> 00:23:00,650
instance we have a few African

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:04,280
organization and I'm proud to say that

00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:07,490
in some African communities open-source

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,820
is making event thanks also to the

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,800
combined effort of several OSI

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,160
affiliates

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:19,760
so what is going to to happen in the

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,670
next 10 years will change community

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,010
styles I think that we have to be to

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,960
understand that we have to overcome the

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,800
community boundaries

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:35,720
and work more together different

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:38,720
communities instead of starting to

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,020
decide recently at the meeting I've seen

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,420
a representative of Ubuntu openSUSE and

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,750
Fedora starting to discuss about the

00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:51,490
bits and bytes in their distribution I

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:56,100
think that they were losing their time

00:23:51,490 --> 00:24:00,179
they should talk on how together

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:03,690
they can address more enterprises more

00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:12,740
companies to have them deploy open

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:18,299
source software and so we looking at the

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:21,260
the community Styles you see we we went

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:26,130
from the the enthusiasts and advocates

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:28,700
to professionals in terms of single

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:32,190
project companies we went from really

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,950
closed and it was probably necessary at

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:39,919
first to concentrate internally but in

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:44,520
the future we will have to work together

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:48,390
license consolidation don't count on our

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,740
side to approve many more licenses we

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:58,530
will probably start reducing them

00:24:51,740 --> 00:25:04,020
because there are too many and we also

00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:06,990
have rediscovered software freedom at

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:11,419
first open source was seen as a kind of

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:15,750
immoral methodology you were against the

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:17,429
private property today of everyone

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,480
understands the double SUSE means

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:23,669
sharing knowledge and therefore sharing

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,010
knowledge is the only way forward for

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:33,630
Humanity and this is the way forward for

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:35,789
software and so OSI is trying to after

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:39,000
having crystallized consensus on the

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:40,710
licenses and then against licenses

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,870
because during the second decade we have

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,080
rejected more licenses than we have

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,679
accepted in the future we would like to

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:54,690
work more on communities and working

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:58,710
together working beyond the licenses to

00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:05,850
make a real business ecosystem around

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:07,210
free and open source software I would

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,690
say

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:14,300
we have another 10 years I can tell you

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,510
that I will probably be there I'm 63 so

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:20,630
I said officially that I will retire

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:24,080
when I will be 76 so it will be there

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:30,470
for the next 10 years if you accept me

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:35,000
of course but the only way we can do

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:37,270
that is together so join us I am at the

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,790
same time an individual member and

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:43,270

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:51,470
the local Italian association associates

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:55,720
