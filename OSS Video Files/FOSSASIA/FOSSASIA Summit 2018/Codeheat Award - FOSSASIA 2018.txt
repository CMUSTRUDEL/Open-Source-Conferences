ah Fozzie Shia have started this unique

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:10,590
coding contest called code heat which

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,620
actually starts from September and ends

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,980
in Feb is a six month coding competition

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,380
which actually helps new developers

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,789
developers who are new to open source to

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,019
come and contribute to some of the

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,140
causation of projects and this year we

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,140
kicked off the second code heat contest

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,800
and we have some I have some amazing

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,620
stats now we were able to get 650

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,410
developers registered during the six

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,420
month of time period for the code hit

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,850
contest and we were able to close around

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,329
2,000 plus pull requests with the help

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,700
of 37 Mentors I think you should know

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,890
give a big round of applause

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,470
[Applause]

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,650
[Music]

00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,650
and so at the end of the contest we

00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,989
picked up three winners who have made

00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,860
some amazing contributions and have made

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:09,320
of great pro kleh progression and they

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,930
we have helped them flight to Singapore

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,820
to attend Foss Asia and you know get a

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:19,420
chance to meet other developers and

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:22,640
bring up their networking network so I

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:30,440
like to invite Mario to take over the

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:32,690
ceremony session yes so for anyone who

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,970
has seen the program maybe we have a lot

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,880
of people coming here on stage in a

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,210
moment so give us a few seconds to get

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,790
everyone here aligned and I can tell you

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,330
a bit about code heat in the mean time

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:50,780
so coach it is our coding contest and

00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,300
and yeah we started it because we saw

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,940
like this works really well right I mean

00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,240
you're the coding contest people get a

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,310
certificate there are some winners and

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,640
yeah they built up their get a profile

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,890
very good for their future and everyone

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,709
just learns a lot so it's really fun to

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,330
do this and yeah we do this nearly six

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,590
months that starts like right after

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,299
google Summer of Code

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,660
you know like cool some of course a

00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:20,940
famous coding program here

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,790
in the world many projects like 1500

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,650
take part but we ask ourselves what do

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,870
we do after Google some of course like

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,220
we need to engage people yeah like the

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,900
same question that we had on the panel

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,720
like how do we engage with people right

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,940
there in other countries even other

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,180
continents and how do we connect so

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,780
contents is always a good way and

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,940
everyone benefits so let me show you a

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,270
little bit here in details so we have

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,190
the website on coated dot-org and that's

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,230
how it works the jury chooses the three

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,110
winners from the top ten code

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,300
contributors very easy but so difficult

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,850
yeah like you just look which are the

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,040
top contributors and then you check like

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,750
there's a jury saying okay this one did

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,630
more like quality commits other

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,880
contributors maybe make like more like

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,970
fronting or like something not so deep

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,000
so they as a jury in the end deciding

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,400
among the best contributors and so the

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,500
contributions also includes scrum

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,049
reports and technical blog posts because

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,900
we want people to connect yeah it's not

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,940
just like here's my code somebody check

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,310
it hey mentor and please check my coat

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,079
and we want people actually to engage in

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,810
the community and to share their

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,489
knowledge and then a winner's present

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,350
the work here at the facility open tech

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,030
summit so we have some lightning talks

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,970
we have workshops and so on

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,560
and they're not just prizes for the top

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,180
winners and then they're also like

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,070
t-shirts and yeah it's wacky vouchers um

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,070
and of course a certificate of

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,290
participation maybe like I know like

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,790

German Michelle Kristin who made this

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,160
big experiment and finally it worked out

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,590
we could see the offline Susie talking

difficult though for you to know who is

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,090
who because you don't have the faces you

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,620
just see the code yeah and then you

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,940
always ask me at the fourth Asia Summit

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,280
