[Music]

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,750
hello everybody okay this is not working

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:25,800
I also prepared us backup slides first

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,740
of all I I got the question before where

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,289
do i press what is this okay this one no

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,449
the other one

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:38,730
it's this is for okay this different

00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:43,230
first of all I got the question are you

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,699
a tech guy because on the on that on the

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,070
announcement there was something with

00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:49,860
finance yes I do finance and controlling

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,650
but usually I do tech in finance in

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,049
controlling yeah so I studied computer

00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:58,470
science it's a long time ago and I study

00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,100
Japanese studies so I'm quite an Asian

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,640
fan

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,659
I have been to Asia along during my

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,880
childhood nearly every year yeah and

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,619
what I'm also doing is doing in tech now

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm a hyper ledger governing board

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,320
member as we join hyper ledger and then

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,810
there came the question who wants to do

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,259
it and I showed it and I said I want to

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,450
do it and I'm doing also blockchain

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,020
enablement so a lot of the things of the

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,799
project you see comes from my department

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,179
or different departments where we try to

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,240
leverage the potential that we have

00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:37,740
there and now I'm very proud and that I

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,859
actually do it because for nine years

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,960
since I joined the company I was talking

00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,450
about free and open source and I wanted

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,630
that we leverage it more and more and

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,810
now actually we have a big project going

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,600
on whether we want to do a lot more in

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,170
this and we have a strategy that we want

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,719
to set up to even use that potential

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,719
more and I'm very proud of that because

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,530
I also was one of the guys who were

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,360
always telling this and now I'm also

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:13,170
have the task of actually doing it and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,170
this makes me even more proud and my

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,150
last job is I'm also a model so if you

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,460
go to the website and want to apply for

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,319
a job for instance and then you might

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,250
also find my my picture there

00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:30,379
but I tell you it doesn't pay well yeah

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,390
so a long time ago this guy said I

00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,200
believe in horses automobiles and

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,819
they're passing our fsync phenomenon

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,290
this guy wasn't right

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:46,819
we now have quite a big company already

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:50,860
we have 280,000 employees we are going

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:54,290
from one record year to another one and

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:57,079
sometimes it's unbelievable how good the

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,720
growth is and how much we are doing with

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,060
that but it's not only about the car

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,250
anymore and so we have a new ecosystem

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,590
and we have La Rue here who's the head

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,090
of case case stands for connected

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:13,129
autonomous shared or services and

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,480
electric and this is our new strategy in

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:22,220
terms of building new cars but we also

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:27,349
built logistics solutions so trucks or

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:30,639
vans and we have mobility solutions as

00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:34,579
as a third option where you can engage

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:37,099
so also this guy said I think there's a

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:41,030
world market for maybe five computers it

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:43,819
was Thomas Watson the head of IBM and

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,519
now I'm a little bit curious why

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:50,030
actually if Thomas did this kind of

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,609
predictions why they named their AI also

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,889
Watson yeah I hope it doesn't make this

00:03:52,609 --> 00:04:01,639
kind of predictions so cars in the

00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:04,669
beginning were 100 percent mechanical

00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,500
Hardware yeah this has zero lines of

00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:11,900
code the only code there were worthless

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:17,269
this plans that the guy here at draw it

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:21,680
went 1885 into production and 1886 it

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:23,960
came out the it's what I found quite

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,729
interesting is that a lot of the

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,310
hardware that were built in and the

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:30,860
functionality or the way how the motor

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,529
was built is still in today's cars and

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,819
to Dylan to stay smooth today's motors

00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:40,159
prevalent so yeah it has zero flops

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:48,529
needless to say it doesn't have a CPU in

00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:50,599
it so 100 years later in the in the

00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:53,629
development of cars we made already

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,239
quite an advancement and using this kind

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:58,609
of technology at this time I really was

00:04:56,239 --> 00:05:02,119
quite happy that I found this kind of

00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:05,419
video you can see that we were

00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:07,669
simulating and using computers to build

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:12,619
things and to build cars and even make

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:15,769
it even better and also the interesting

00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:18,139
thing is that at that time we started

00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:21,409
aust built in small computer chips in

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,749
terms of engine steering and so on into

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,749
the into the system's into the cars yeah

00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:29,809
so this was the very small event of the

00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:32,329
first cars with first computerized cars

00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:36,249
I don't know how much drops they had

00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:39,949
yeah at least they weren't Giga anything

00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:41,899
and even nowadays you can buy chip

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,419
hacking to get more out of your car and

00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:48,709
it's just doing something with the

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:54,049
software you have to be careful it will

00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:56,959
also void your warranty usually right

00:05:54,049 --> 00:06:00,019
but if you look at the new cars that

00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:03,109
come out you could see that there's a

00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,999
different feel to it it's actually a

00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:07,339
software masterpiece we have a lot of

00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:08,209
different systems in there and with a

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,589
new a-class

00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:18,080
we also brought out a new interface and

00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:23,290
it's called env UX is bad

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,290
[Music]

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,180
timon say this yes please I want some

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,670
German bullet

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,830
please select an entry making more

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,970
Eagles I am setting the temperature to

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,500
62 degrees

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:45,570
why is there a wedding chapel from your

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:48,830
suggestions I'm a babies navigate me to

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:52,339
walk free word drive single beef

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,339
[Music]

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,110
hi Mercedes where did Jeff Drive us last

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:12,389
night

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:15,270
tattoo shop Las Vegas so you can see

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,759
this quite shifted it ham and I got out

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,889
those key facts of this of the system

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,300
and it's only a front-end system it has

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,580
two GPUs terms when it's used it's it's

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,969
depending on the on the power that we

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,180
need yeah it has eight gigabyte of RAM

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:36,210
and 500gb flops in the operating system

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,520
is Linux so you can see that's quite a

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,560
shift yeah and it's only the front end

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,479
computer we have all safety relevant

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,620
parts that are different we have to

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,589
think about that as well

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,300
yeah it has machine learning in it to

00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,189
also know your habits a little bit more

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,839
and to give you the right suggestions

00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:54,330
where you should drive or if you always

00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,270
drive to work and it will already if you

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:02,009
get in will set you a goal where you can

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:05,639
go yeah so actually with this front-end

00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:08,430
and then several other parts a car for

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:14,009
me I'm a computer scientists is merely a

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:16,770
server cluster on wheels so I ask myself

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,740
what do engineers and software engineers

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,110
actually do have in common and one of

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:27,629
our founders here gottlieb daimler said

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:29,490
the best or nothing and I actually what

00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,529
passed was quite hard to find the right

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,760
quote of lino stores because usually

00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:38,370
there are more diplomat ori and work on

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,260
this code is not so good but i didn't

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,209
want to get it on the slides because i I

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,269
was afraid I'd won't bring it through

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:47,810
the to the clearance process yeah if I

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:52,339
have get the crap out of my sight

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:55,320
something on data on the slide yeah but

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:58,709
the thing is what we're just really

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,540
really important is that they have one

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,490
thing in common and it's the will of

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,870
making something really

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,300
the best and the best means is different

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,880
in every eyes I had a talk with somebody

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:16,740
else here who said this doing design and

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,800
the best for the engineers is not always

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,899
the best for the user yeah and this is

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,990
the same stays proved with cars

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,880
sometimes the engineers get so over over

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,399
paste would I want to do this and this

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,130
and then it's something else that

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,070
somebody cannot use anymore yeah and we

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,140
have to also think about that so what we

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,350
are doing what we did last like year

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,610
last year was this slide on it we joined

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,490
a Linux Foundation

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:48,330
we also are kind of in the Eclipse

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,459
Foundation we joined automotive-grade

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:54,450
Linux and hyper later where I'm also

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:57,390
sitting in and we went to the Foss Asia

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,630
and this year we are again at the Foss

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,180
Asia what happened in between a lot of

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:07,020
ground work from a lot of people who are

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,140
telling we have to do more and now I'm

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:14,339
quite proud that we have young breasts

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:19,200
which is the boss of the IT in general

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:21,660
is the CIO of Daimler has brought this

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,130
to his attention and not only his

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,020
attention but there's also a project

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,870
going on for R&D and IT and legal and

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,000
compliance guys so he said one of his

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,079
three top priorities is free and open

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,940
source software

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,070
the others were cloud and DevOps so to

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,470
strengthen the delivery model and the

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,110
next one is indirect to direct so

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,390
bringing people more closer to the code

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,720
again and because we have a history of

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,029
doing a lot of management but management

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,860
will won't produce you any product if

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:59,190
you don't have the guys who produce the

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:05,020
product and so this is the the three

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:07,210
priorities it's also public so why why

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,150
actually the question so what can we

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:16,570
learn as Daimler from the open-source

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:20,650
community so what I think is open-source

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:23,620
and and the standard or the way how the

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:26,680
open-source community work is one of the

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,180
major things that has been now set to

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,450
the standard actually of software

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,910
development and we could use that and we

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,970
should learn from that so the the whole

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,460
idea of forking something yeah

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,360
just taking it away not having and under

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:46,030
control then patching or doing whatever

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,270
you want with it and if you deem it good

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:52,750
then put in a pull request yeah and

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,480
somebody merges it and hopefully merges

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,990
it or it says go away with the scrap

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,850
cycle eNOS does it sometimes but this

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,220
kind of working actually set a new

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,100
standard of also distributed working

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:10,890
model this has not been possible before

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:13,570
and as always in all industries are lot

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,780
ideas about how to reducing cost and

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:20,260
bringing well the work distributing the

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:24,700
work all over the world this means that

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:27,850
this is now possible also speed of

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,770
innovation if you have something under

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,830
tight control and tell people you have

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,590
to innovate this is how you innovate

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:38,170
then people won't be as creative as if

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:41,010
you won't do it yeah and if you give

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,540
somebody the chance I take that

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,910
co-create build something completely new

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,210
out of it again and maybe something

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,250
completely new and something which never

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,560
has been there before like blockchain or

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,680
other technologies come out of it then

00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,220
we created something which can help to

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,590
alleviate some others so this is the the

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,190
speed of innovation and the third part

00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:09,550
is a community so working together as a

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,070
community and collaborating and the way

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,980
of talking to each other and also

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,800
looking at the different posts and

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,500
things everybody does and giving kudos

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,190
to somebody or saying this this is

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,950
really good

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,980
and having an active discussion about

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,649
the topic this is also quite one of the

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,990
things that we can learn also one of the

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,779
things that I wanted to stress out what

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:38,050
we shouldn't learn is sometimes the way

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:43,660
how the open-source community thrives on

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:46,149
egocentricity so sometimes it is not

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,850
anymore about the product about the part

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,880
which is in the software it's more about

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,550
I said so and so it has to be like this

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,620
and if people are on the front fight

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,829
then usually something happens it's a

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:03,420
hard fork and I don't think that usually

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,420
it helps anybody yeah

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:11,980
so we are or I'm also developing a lot

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,019
of things in blockchain and III I think

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,570
there's analogy here because the

00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,880
blockchain means also that you have to

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,440
collaborate it's impossible to not

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,170
collaborate or else you don't get the

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,490
point of blockchain so you have to have

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,620
an ecosystem where you build something

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,390
together and we started last year we had

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,089
I think a talk about blockchain here

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:35,410
where we showed some pilot use cases

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:39,010
that we did and during the year I had

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,990
some war so we did a first public

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,810
blockchain hackathon in Stuttgart which

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,209
was quite insightful and a lot of

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:49,959
different ideas in there so this is also

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:52,270
a quite a forum how we how we engage in

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,930
it in even more yeah so we get people

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:58,329
from outside in bringing ideas and

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:01,149
elaborating on that and I can tell you

00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:03,970
we didn't have any rules on that one to

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:07,630
that the IP is belongs to us after that

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:11,260
yeah so this was quite a discussion at

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:14,410
some point but in the end we made it

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,149
like this and we have another thing here

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,790
we have a green driving experiment going

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:22,480
on currently we are trying to

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,760
incentivize how people drive and change

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,910
over that behavior and this is backed up

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,520
by a cryptocurrency and the standard

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,660
token in behind and the greener you

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,600
drive the

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,910
of those tokens you get at the moment

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,910
you cannot spend them at all it's just a

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,910
test but so where can we go with it

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:49,660
so there's also a thing I wanted to

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,150
mention we are engaging in that and very

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,930
long time so there has been a project

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:58,240
which is focused on analyzing crash data

00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,480
because that is for everybody it's a

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,170
good thing and it's called open MDM and

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,730
open path so so this is these are the

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,250
building blocks in our journey and this

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,280
is also kind of how the project is

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,050
currently structured we have first of

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,690
all we have to ensure in compliance and

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,120
this is sure there are a lot of

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,180
different licenses and too much license

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,760
in actually outside and if you engage in

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,680
some product or programming and you have

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,600
to check which license can I use in

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,380
which notices can I not use it's quite

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,660
difficult

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,150
yeah and but we have to ensure the

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,070
compliance or else we have lawyers again

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:40,300
stepping in yeah and you don't want

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:42,760
Liars messing around with your code so

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,290
first of all we won't adapt the the

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,870
collaboration model which is inner

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,360
source and we want to adapt it more and

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:53,020
more inside a company and I'm quite

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,000
happy that we have now also a set up a

00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,600
rule set at least an IT that we have to

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,360
share all our source code this is quite

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,449
new we want to encourage the usage and

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,329
even faster more and use an iterate upon

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,610
the open source but it's presumptuous to

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,650
think that you can just take all the

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:15,970
time you also have to give something so

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:19,650
we want to make it possible to engage in

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:24,400
communities even more by money by

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:26,760
resources by ideas and so on and we even

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,430
want to foster open source contribution

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:35,940
which is believe me quite hard if you're

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:39,010
legally speaking so also I yeah I don't

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,500
think that I mean if I come here or if

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,679
we come here and

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,850
explain something about open source

00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,140
people might think yeah then tomorrow

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,990
you are there yeah you will do

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,320
everything but you have to remember it

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,630
is a company of 280,000 people and it's

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,090
not changing as fast and not everybody

00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,630
has the same idea so we need the right

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,549
foundations we read ninite leverage also

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,120
we need also the right people behind it

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:08,400
because also if I talk we want to do

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,409
this if this kind of software to the

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,750
open and somebody in a legal department

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,610
will ask me oh are we not giving that

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,100
away and how do we do with the Texas and

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,169
so on and that is actually is a quite

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,360
hard question in a certain sense because

00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,460
we have to at least hear it and in a big

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,470
company you always have a specialist for

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,049
this kind of questions so what I'm doing

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,840
is I'm a talking to a lot of different

00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,740
specialists at the moment but it will

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,409
lead to that

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:41,309
that if we have a good foundation we can

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:46,770
also have a top later on so in the end I

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:50,520
think what I want to give you an offer

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,480
is that I would like you to join also

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:58,590
the way and I would like us to drive

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,190
together to this new path and to the

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:06,209
future

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,209
[Applause]

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,789
Thank You Eunice I have a question for

00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,889
you so you have mentioned about the

00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,809
green driving and will be getting

00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:18,389
rewards for that yes so what can we use

00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,460
those divides at the moment as we are

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:23,039
just testing it internally with 500

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,279
employees you can win something you can

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:31,159
win for instance a tennis match or you

00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:37,049
can win going to the Berlin Fashion Show

00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:40,019
or DTM race but the second step after we

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,909
have like this - - it's an MVP so a

00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:45,149
Minimum Viable Product yeah not a

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:46,739
maximum Viable Product after this two

00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,179
months we will see how we proceed

00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:51,210
further because we are collecting data

00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:55,499
and see what it can be used for but the

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,850
idea is to expand yeah thank you so much

00:19:55,499 --> 00:20:00,560
