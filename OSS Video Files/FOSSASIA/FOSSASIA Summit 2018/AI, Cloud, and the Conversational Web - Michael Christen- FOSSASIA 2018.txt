Free and open source implementations of digital assistants are challenged with the complexity of the conversational web ecosphere of smart devices and the ability to create intelligent skills out of cloud services.

The FOSSASIA community has worked hard to create such an ecosystem to establish a personal assistant framework for everyone based on the principle of privacy and collaboration.

New web services, based on Artificial Intelligence technology approach quickly as intelligent digital personal assistants beyond the ability of simple chatbots.

Search engines will provide us with answers to all questions within the framework of conversational interfaces.
