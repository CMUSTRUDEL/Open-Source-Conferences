good to see all of you here um some of

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,429
you might know me some somebody not so I

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,320
just brief introduction I'm a member of

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,440
parliament elect a member of parliament

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,990
and I used to work in four different

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,930
government ministries as a Minister of

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,660
State in Singapore we call that

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,760
political office holder so I just left

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,830
the government to set up my ventures and

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,890
before I enter politics I already had

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,050
business experience about 15 years

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,880
running different companies

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,430
multinational companies and I have also

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,670
listed one company before together my

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,920
partner so there was 15 years before

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,559
politics and when I worked for the

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,809
government it was a good 11 years as a

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,239
full-time political office holder and

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,850
recently last year middle last year I

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,010
left a ministry to set up my own

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,789
different ventures which today taught us

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,840
to about seven of them I'm also chairing

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,299
to publicly listed bots of companies

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,500
that listed in Singapore and to other

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:13,710
BOTS overseas so business is right in my

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,930
blood technology as well I was just

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,080
sharing of a friend of mine I said in

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,549
fact this this topic I should get my

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,290
wife to come here my wife is a real

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,390
techy my son to with my son is about 19

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,369
years old and so they both wrote a key

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,140
and they know all about this better than

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,729
I do but business-wise I believe that

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,030
several of my ventures actually

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,509
benefited from crowdsourcing and open

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,299
sourcing of projects and also sauce

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,869
quotes and technologies out there we

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,430
have benefited from there of seven three

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,869
already profitable so very glad that

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,649
some of those technologies that I had

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,799
was because we were able to identify

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,320
talents as well as technology through

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,939
the open platform and I think it goes

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,770
without saying and I don't have to tell

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,080
you what open source software or

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,420
technology that will bring benefits to

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
the economy especially in a small

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,890
economy like

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,230
we're trying to be a tech hub innovation

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,220
hub and there's a lot of new thinking

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,560
that we need a venture builder like

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,950
myself entrepreneur myself I'm always

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,810
looking out for the best ideas and also

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:36,350
the best innovation out there since

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,390
Sparta is small peg and how such tech

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,120
could transform companies

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,690
I bought two old companies I transformed

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,150
them to technology and I tried to

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,880
digitize many of the things they do

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,040
but there's limitation to what I could

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,570
do we didn't Singapore so what happens

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,450
is that I sourced out into China and

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:03,140
Thailand Vietnam and surprisingly

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,030
Vietnam gave me the solution so so some

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,940
of this experience that I had I realized

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:12,800
that actually a an event like that

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,840
should be strongly encouraged and I was

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
quite surprised in some way that he has

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,070
been so many years and and I'm actually

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,790
quite new to this but I'm glad that I'm

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:26,239
plucking now to get out of the rest I'm

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,070
curious to know that that this event

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,650
actually would be able see certain

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,739
deliverables that actually helps us in

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,980
our community one of the projects that I

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,720
used to do in the government which in

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,850
that ministry's Ministry of Trade

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,549
industry when I was in the minister to

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,040
industry for a good five years I

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:48,940
developed or helped developed together

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,440
with Jerome town corporation which is

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,450
overseeing all the industry St the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,019
launch pad in ayodhya

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,680
or block 71 and when when I visualized

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,170
that that was to create an ecosystem for

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,880
innovation and entrepreneurship and that

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,610
has developed into a sort of a tech

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,070
innovation hub and there are so many

00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,590
many of the communities then little cell

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,170
groups sharing among themselves what

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,570
they need to do and some from open

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,180
source to become papaya tree which I

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,370
thought well that is there generally if

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,370
you go to market then maybe when is

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,130
investment and ventures coming in

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,100
investments

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,130
then suddenly from open to pop our tree

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,140
and how do you actually keep it still

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,750
open and how do you continue to be able

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,800
to share we build an ecosystem or block

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:45,690
71 and launchpad to today it's expanded

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,420
into San Francisco Jakarta Soochow in

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,490
China thanks to several of the

00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,830
accelerators and incubators around there

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,240
but Singapore has to have a long way to

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,460
go we need to plug into the

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,170
international network in order to make

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,470
this the whole network to be really

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:05,490
successful so it's not just a technical

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:08,100
part but it's really the whole business

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,100
part and how do we keep it sustainable I

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,140
think giving better communities one but

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,080
the committee would have to translate

00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,530
that into the economy itself and I

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,770
believe that the whole venture capital

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,320
the whole funding and the whole

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,560
ecosystem will have to keep in to make

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,510
an open source platform truly truly

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,580
beneficial to the economy and I stand to

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,860
benefit from this as well as a venture

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,470
builder and I also look forward to

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,240
plucking with everyone I was looking at

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,160
the pictures and all that and seeing so

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,070
many of you I say there's lots of

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,780
talents out there I'm today a dove of

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,010
talent in a venture as you know

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,250
Singapore is tight on labor but we have

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,320
lots of talents is can find a vein today

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:03,740
look at some adventures is multinational

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:08,010
is a United Nation I have a experts from

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:12,300
yeah experts from Taiwan I have also

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:16,230
from China I have in Singapore too but I

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,560
would say the majority that coming into

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,540
my ventures from overseas and most of

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,210
the time I plug them back into the

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:29,070
region to achieve be closer to the

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:31,740
market all my seven four of them are

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,800
consumer focus so consumer product

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,240
consumer services consumer focus and the

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,419
other three are actually business focus

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,789
corporation focus so there are many

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,039
things that I would say that we follow

00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,470
the business we follow where the market

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,720
is so for me

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,470
as far as the way I see the whole region

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,389
growing and how businesses grow and with

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,360
technology like this and with platforms

00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,460
like this is that I believe that when we

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,800
can get ourselves connected effectively

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,810
throughout the region there will be the

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,569
most effective than the ecosystem can be

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,280
so hopefully you'll be successful in

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,070
having this event I keep it sustainable

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,990
and then you're on year we will see

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,900
better results and more result and more

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,690
quantifiable deliverables that can come

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,400
out this event especially for all the

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,509
talents that we have out there thank you

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:30,030
very much I hope you have a successful

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:30,030
