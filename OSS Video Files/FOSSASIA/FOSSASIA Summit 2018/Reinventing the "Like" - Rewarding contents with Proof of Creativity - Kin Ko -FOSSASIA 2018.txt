Permissive license for contents encourages creativity and knowledge distribution. However, it largely relies on the selflessness of the creators in doing so. LikeCoin is designed to address such issue. It tracesÂ derivative work with the content footprint on Ethereum blockchain, gives every content a LikeRank and rewards creators by proof of creativity.
