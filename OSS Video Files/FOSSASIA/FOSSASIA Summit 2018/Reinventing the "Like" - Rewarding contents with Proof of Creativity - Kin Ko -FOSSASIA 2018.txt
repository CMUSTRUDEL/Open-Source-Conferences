	Speaker: Kin Ko
Info: https://2018.fossasia.org/event/speakers.html#kin-ko3354

Permissive license for contents encourages creativity and knowledge distribution. However, it largely relies on the selflessness of the creators in doing so. LikeCoin is designed to address such issue. It tracesÂ derivative work with the content footprint on Ethereum blockchain, gives every content a LikeRank and rewards creators by proof of creativity.

is it an you're working I see okay sorry

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,009
about the technical issues I'm not able

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,369
to use my presentation actually so but

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,100
so my the deck I'm using here is

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,519
slightly different than I prepared for

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,789
this event but but it's pretty much same

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,890
so it's okay I'm going to talk about our

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,619
initiative which is called like coin and

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,420
we have an aim to be inventor like the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,430
like that you understand on Facebook we

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,559
are going to introduce our mechanism

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
which we called proof of creativity so

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,739
in contrast to proof of work or proof of

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,210
stick we are trying to let creators I

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,250
mean content creators are mine mine my

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,260
coins with their creativity with their

00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,870
contents so the problems we are trying

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,430
to tackle is pretty office actually

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:09,780
everyone knows no secret is that

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:14,490
freelancers the slash workers those

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,409
digital januaries they work for likes

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,080
but not they don't really get any

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,119
rewards on the internet they are always

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,689
creating contents but but they get likes

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,890
only not a lot with you will be warts

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:32,100
and this group of people actually they

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,610
are getting more and more people having

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,560
this kind of lifestyle and the contents

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,210
are getting higher and higher in quality

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,399
because of the improvement of the

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,880
hardware like iPhone with an iPhone you

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,770
can take pictures similar to what we do

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,140
with our single lens reflex so there are

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:59,939
there are few elements of like on polka

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,640
which I'll go to explain one by one one

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,710
is our we invented like button a like

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,420
button that is similar to the Facebook

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,520
like but kind of we reinvent it and then

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,500
we have an algorithm called like rank

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,890
which is similar to our page rank or

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,310
cool

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,080
and then the tool combined it with will

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:25,200
be what we call our proof of creativity

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:30,150
so let's take a very brief look of the

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,060
history of intellect extremely beef so

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,460
20 years ago our Google the founders of

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,090
Google published their paper in Stanford

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,460
which is the PageRank paper and then

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,760
they found it Google based it on this

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,280
core technology so that our PageRank is

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,110
to measure the importance of web page

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,390
and the logic is pretty simple like

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:57,620
they're saying they have an assumption

00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:01,220
that if there are more incoming links

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,560
the if there are many other web pages

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,660
pointing to that web page it means that

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,810
web page is important so they have a

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:14,040
high like rain and so it's easier for us

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:17,070
to search to reach this our web page by

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,820
search engine so like rank is something

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:24,090
very similar but to apply that on

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,150
creative contents by creative contents I

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,489
mean like images like article it's

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,830
elements of web pages not web pages

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,820
itself but the elements of web page

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:41,250
let's take image as an example in our

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:45,930
hour all of our discussion so let's say

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:50,070
an image has a lot of directive work

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,930
such as I wanted to demo but since I'm

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,120
not using my computer I'm not able to

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,980
download the real site you can actually

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:04,019
go to a mint dot light dot Co ME ME ME

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:12,060
mo dot light dot Co to see this demo so

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:14,370
it's a demo of a directive work and what

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,440
how like Ren works so this particular

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,750
image because it generates a lot of

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,970
directive works

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,970
this image is pasted on this this image

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,510
is also based on this so we are in our

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,760
algorithm this image has a high like run

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:35,970
and the relationship between these

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:40,700
images in line we call that content

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:44,070
footprint content footprint means a

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:49,320
content was derived in another it may be

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:52,560
an inclusion say I'm I mean I'm a writer

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,150
I've I've written an article regarding

00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,570
for say and then a leak an image then I

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,480
are an image taken by one of you that's

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:08,700
a kind of content footprint other case

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:11,010
of content footprints are such as if you

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,140
make an image and then at the filter to

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,710
become an image that's also content

00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,890
footprint so in our ecosystem if we're

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,340
content if a creative content gem is

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,780
more other creative contents then it

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,780
will have height like rank

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:37,710
and in caucus say because this image has

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,620
no directive work it is a lot like rank

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,850
and the other factor that of actually

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,760
like rank of particular content is the

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:50,160
license itself because we enforce Asia

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:55,320
and we are talking about open we are

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,770
encouraging open so say for example

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,170
these two contents these two images both

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,860
of them have no directive work at all

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:09,950
but say if this content is copyrighted

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:13,260
always reserved it while this image is

00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:16,620
creative comments then this image will

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:19,530
have a higher like rank than this one so

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,220
it is kind of similar to because Google

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:28,140
also favors open system an open source

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:32,190
so the second element is like button

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:37,070
like button is kind of similar to the

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,510
like button as we know on Facebook turn

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,840
but the first five are pretty much the

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:46,770
same it's a five-point scale for users

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,660
for audience to to show their

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,070
appreciation how much they like the

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,820
content how much they appreciate the

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:56,760
content while the last one is special we

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,550
call that super like if you really like

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,150
the content then you can click super

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:06,150
like and pay a certain creator or some

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,930
like coins out of your own pocket while

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,730
for the first five buttons you don't

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,570
have to the reader don't have to pay

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:18,990
anything is actually helping the content

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:23,700
creator to my like coin so the tool

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:27,150
factors like button and then like rank

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:30,660
combined it is what we call proof of

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,140
creativity and we have a mining pool of

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,710
1 billion in total like coin has 2

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:41,279
billion coins in the in the pool out of

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:44,249
which 50% of it which is 1 billion

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,199
we are we sorted it for we have reserved

00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:52,769
it for the content creators and we are

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,379
minting little bit of like coin every

00:07:52,769 --> 00:08:00,139
day according to this formula the

00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:04,009
formula is not so important in this

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:09,379
context but as long as we remember the

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:15,179
Chuck so if we put t say is say it's day

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:20,909
five 365 one year from the launch we

00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:23,610
park in T equals 365 then we will get

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:27,089
the lump of points that will be minted

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,879
that day for example ten thousand let's

00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:33,000
say one year after the launch we're

00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:38,159
minting ten thousand on that day ten

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,169
thousand like coin so on that day among

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,610
all the contents in the like coin

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:48,899
ecosystem they got 1 million say 1

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:58,040
million likes which means on average

00:08:48,899 --> 00:09:01,309
each content will get 0.01 like coin so

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,529
ten thousand like point to be

00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:09,180
distributed to 1 million likes

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:12,089
so each like will on average get 0.01

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,769
like coin but that's only the the a fish

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,790
because the other factor which is

00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:21,360
actually more important is the like rank

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:24,209
so if this tool back to this example if

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,410
these two images they are getting the

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:30,389
same number of likes this image will

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,250
have more like point than this

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:37,129
particular image because the like rank

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:40,829
is higher so our formula our algorithm

00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:43,680
favors contents that has height like

00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:47,089
rank and contents that has an an open

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,079
license and we caught this mechanism

00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:54,720
proof of creativity and smart settlement

00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:59,670
this is an example in which a content

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:04,019
and image T was made from image a and

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:09,529
image C combined it an image C itself is

00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:15,809
made from our image P so when reader

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:19,069
like or super like image D the coin will

00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:21,929
go to will actually go to all four

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:24,689
creators involved in the along the

00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:27,809
Creator train and all the four platforms

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:32,850
in water in the process that's what we

00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:37,139
call a smart settlement so the

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:41,759
technology stack we are like coin is

00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:45,179
pasted on if idiom so we are on on the

00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:48,509
second the development is mostly on the

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:50,879
the second layer here and we are based

00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:54,029
on aphelion so we write smart contracts

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,790
on top of the etherium network and we

00:10:54,029 --> 00:11:01,379
store the fingerprints of every content

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:07,470
on medium also we are stay storing the

00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:10,189
meta data hash on medium and the actual

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,069
data is actually stored on ipfs the

00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:16,709
independent or a filesystem which is a

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:21,120
distributed file system across the world

00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:25,259
hosted by lots of ipfs nooks and on top

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:30,089
of like coins services there are few the

00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:34,740
apps developed by us to store the act as

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:38,610
the interface for end users and like

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,299
coin itself is an open protocol and also

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,160
open source available on kik up today so

00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:47,549
actually other than ourselves who are

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,100
making the the apps everyone can also

00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:55,259
build their the apps on top of like coin

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,449
so these are the apps that's working on

00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:01,439
the like on ecosystem

00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:03,990
I'll introduce two of them one is what

00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:05,279
we call booty images which is a pre

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,970
office the office

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,660
of Getty image so I get image is the

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,999
biggest image database as you may know

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,550
so we are making a pretty images which

00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:21,509
is also an image database storing all

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:25,649
the most of the open contents the images

00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:30,980
but which you can use for free and if

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:34,910
you use picker image from the put image

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,819
database you are going to put a like

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:42,240
below the image and if people like the

00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:44,939
image both you and the photographer

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,689
himself him or himself or herself will

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:53,129
get a like coin in the similar way as

00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:56,339
here so this is an example of image but

00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:59,360
you can imagine this is say you're a

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,449
writer like like me I write stuffs I

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,879
write something and I'll eat an image so

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:10,529
I include this image into my work and

00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:14,540
when my work get litecoin the

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:14,540
photographer will get like on as well so

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:22,110
so the very core of litecoin is to

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:25,160
encourage people to use open license for

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,680
their credit for their creations and

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,259
since it's for Asia we are all about top

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,139
we are talking about encouraging open

00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,029
standards open technology open license

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,269
but over the years

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:42,360
usually when we ask others to open their

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:46,500
contents is very much based it on

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:51,360
selflessness like based it on that you

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,670
want to you want to contribute while we

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,670
are trying to provide a business model

00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,269
for contribution for Creative Commons

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:03,120
say there are at the moment there are

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:05,100
about 1.3 billion works on on the

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,259
internet which is licensed under

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,470
Creative Commons but they don't really

00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:12,660
have a business model what we are trying

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,730
to do is is to offer a business model

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,170
for all these Creative Commons content

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:23,809
and the ironic thing is

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:27,389
it actually works in contrast to the

00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:30,119
traditional wisdom because traditionally

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,819
we think if I open my work I will not

00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:36,470
get any income but in the like current

00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:40,559
system the more open you are actually

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:44,189
the more easy you get like coin say for

00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,919
this image say day it is creative

00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:49,919
comments so a lot of people use this

00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,350
image to like build their own content

00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,889
then this image will get a lot of like

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,499
coin Wow for this photographer day they

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,079
close their content and is not getting

00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:04,109
any directive work and it's not getting

00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:07,669
any like coin so it's the reverse of

00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:12,749
what we have in the traditional world

00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:16,350
and the other surface we are we will

00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:19,769
have next year is blockchain crunching

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:23,519
but in but not be a Ock block Bao Zhi

00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:27,329
Brock it's like blocking unboxing so we

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,879
are offering something like medium but

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:34,129
even more simple than medium we are not

00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:37,199
supporting image it's only text so every

00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:41,519
blog post will start as a piece of

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,519
content on poaching with its own content

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,739
fingerprint if an image is littered

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,929
actually it will point to the image

00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:54,329
stored on put images and the reason is

00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:56,639
called protein MD the domain is called

00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:59,819
project MD is because we are using a

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,639
markdown file to the markdown format to

00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:06,329
store all the blocks so as to stay

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,449
simple and and still keeping the basic

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:13,139
format of all the prop poses so people

00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:17,129
like me who like to write write articles

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:20,789
but not to promote them can store all

00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:23,009
the articles on botching I mean this

00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:26,519
particular website and then the internet

00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:30,509
media will go here - it's like an

00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:33,000
article warehouse and the JIT content

00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:35,670
form you can get

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,960
articles from here to publish on my

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:41,910
website in a legitimate way and still

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,850
keep the attribution you know who

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,610
actually are wrote it in the red

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,280
beginning and then if I get like and

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,830
litecoin certain part of the electron

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,880
will go to the original writer so that's

00:16:52,830 --> 00:17:01,620
the that's the idea this is a case study

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,170
which I may be able to show you on this

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,300
computer I'm not sure sure so this is

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:10,470
the first surface we are doing we called

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,079
it OS oh I see oh is this like made from

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,189
the word of choice and voice the oh I

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:21,060
see II with doubt eech and with Delta V

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:24,300
so we are I've I've been making games

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:27,600
for 18 years because before I start the

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:31,410
like line project last year and I've

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,820
opened source and make our contents

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:40,230
Creative Commons on all of our games so

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:42,740
the art and Sun actually has sang but I

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,410
don't know how to pay the sound

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,960
available here as assets so that writers

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:52,290
can write their story using all these

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,750
assets to make interactive games a lot

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,970
like this oh just now it's a choice aye

00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:02,340
aye skip too fast there our choice of

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:06,120
three choices based it on the choices

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,700
the story will be different and you can

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,970
see these are the contributors of these

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,040
stories and it's not really composed by

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,700
the director but organized by the

00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:21,450
platform itself because every single

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,710
note or every single image the platform

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,710
knows who made it and

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,630
and we can check the

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:39,100
the background of that particular

00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:42,700
creator and what he did before

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:46,120
like they have other contents this is

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:50,950
kind of like IMDB for the movie industry

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:54,429
but it's like IMDB but deployed it on

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,860
the a CG industry so this is the the

00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:00,460
other I'm running out of time so I'm

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:05,649
going to warp up the presentation really

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:08,320
quick so our vision is to have we

00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:11,080
believe our creativity can be maximized

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,200
by a reasonable rewards and permissive

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,730
license and we are trying to offer

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,460
Creative Commons a business model so

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,159
that people who contribute to the

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:26,200
content community can make money out of

00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:29,010
it so this is our wall map we started a

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:34,750
year ago for brainstorming and

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:37,000
development and we we saw some of like

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,519
point last year to fund our development

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,389
and promotion and right now we're in the

00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,880
early bird token sales stage and we are

00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:48,429
launching putting images which the image

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,490
database that I mentioned next quarter

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:55,419
and then finally would be the like

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:57,250
button and then the blockchain AMD this

00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:00,250
I I have to explain a little bit because

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:03,340
a lot of people don't understand why we

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,100
can with what the content creators

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,409
without having the readers pay because

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:12,370
we have in the beginning we have

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:15,190
reserved the 50% of the coins which we

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:19,380
call creators pool these are all for the

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:22,510
creators over 10 years so over actually

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,350
28 years but light percent of the coin

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,720
will be minted in the first 10 years so

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,659
this 1 billion coins will be minted to

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,690
the minted and distributed to the

00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:37,120
content creators day by day every day we

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,269
do settlement and they check how much

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,240
they how much like coin they get through

00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:45,580
their contents this is the toe and serve

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,119
schedule and these are some of the

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,569
earlier

00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:51,729
doctors this but your company is my own

00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:54,729
game company so we contribute all the

00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:59,259
artworks and then some some others are

00:20:54,729 --> 00:21:02,759
the internet media that incorporate like

00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:07,319
button such as by module in in Japan and

00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:10,299
our advisors supporters our team and

00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,769
last but not least if you are interested

00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:17,079
to know more because I have really short

00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:22,329
time please go to depending on your like

00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:25,029
interests the website is like the CEO

00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:27,879
and then if you are coder you can go

00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:29,709
github to search for litecoin it's all

00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:35,079
open source you can see it I'll get it

00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:38,189
today and if you have treated a telegram

00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:40,449
medium or whatever search for like coin

00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:43,649
medium like on there are a lot of other

00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:46,659
articles to explain the concept in a

00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:49,719
deeper than what I just talked about

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:53,049
just now and this is my contact just in

00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:56,499
case you lit you with me on all the like

00:21:53,049 --> 00:22:06,569
all the social media is seeking express

00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:06,569
that that's me thank you yes

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:23,299
the hash the hash is just shot 256 just

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:26,030
like Bitcoin into hash and so it's that

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,580
we incentivize people to follow the

00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:31,010
protocol because if they it's not that

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,620
we protect the copyright but there is to

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,990
be worse we incentivize people to open

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,390
up the license and we incentivize people

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,520
to use it because if they don't use it

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,700
if they don't attribute the original

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:58,809
creator they don't get like coin it is

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:58,809
it's this logic yes yeah

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,470
part of part of it as I explained there

00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:08,030
are two elements number of lights that

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,130
affect the number of light point they

00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,620
will get and the other element which is

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,880
actually more important is the like rank

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:19,549
which is actually a measure of how many

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,490
derivative work an image has generated

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:31,130
the second element is more important but

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:34,270
are we we see is hard to say in my for

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,270
my perspective because

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:43,320
microbots oh so I don't have time to go

00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,240
to too deep but this is a very good

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,760
question are we we have put a lot of

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,760
thoughts on this apart from the very

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,420
traditional way of like popping up

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,660
something - as we bought - poof it's not

00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,470
a boat we also have some mechanism on

00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:05,340
light or seal people can prove their

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,890
identity on in a decentralized way in a

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,809
social way to prove that they are human

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:16,350

00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:20,160
lumber of I mean the strength of their

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:24,179

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,800
like the fundamentals are an article

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:44,000
database and image database and if you

article and then images we will actually

00:25:53,790 --> 00:26:01,080

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:04,590
