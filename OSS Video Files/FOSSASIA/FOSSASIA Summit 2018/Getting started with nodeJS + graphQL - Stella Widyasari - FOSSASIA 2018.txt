The growth in the development of applications using open source APIs and frameworks has created complexity with endless unmaintainable endpoints. This session will focus on my findings in building a NodeJS backend application which leverages on GraphQL and MongoDB as the database. GraphQL offers multiple functionalities in a single endpoint to communicate with front end services. In addition, I will share the advantages and disadvantages of GraphQL and how it is different from REST API. I hope this session will help you to get started in exploring this technology.
