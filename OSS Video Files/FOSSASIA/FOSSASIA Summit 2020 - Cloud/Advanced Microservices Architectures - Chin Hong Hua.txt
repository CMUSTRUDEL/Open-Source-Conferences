Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Cloud
Description: 
	The microservices architecture, as part of a cloud solution design, is increasingly popular with application developers, because of it facilitates rapid, efficient design and deployment of a business service. Such an architecture involves the aggregation of individual microservices developed by small teams, who are further empowered with a flexible tooling and highly efficient coding languages. New architectures have evolved in the recent years, since microservices were invented. This talk will advocate the use of advanced microservices architectures, which will serve to address many issues the typical microservice project faces, including security, availability, manageability and scalability in large scale production environments.The audience will appreciate the adoption of open-source technologies, like Istio, VertX, SpringBoot, Quarkus and Kubernetes, in achieving the ambitious objectives of any successful microservices project.
