Description: 
	Serverless has been garnering great attention and the various cloud platforms have started to provide them as services that anyone can use in order to build services that can scale to handle large amounts of traffic but also scale back to zero if its not zero.In this workshop, we would explore the technologies that power one such service: Google Cloud Run. We would be trying to deploy a Kubernetes cluster and add istio support on to it. After which, we would then install Knative on said cluster and deploy several serverless applications onto it and see how the cluster handles such traffic.
