There are a host of ARM based development boards, possibly the most famous of them being the Raspberry Pi series. There are also many others that very few people may know about. Some boards are more or less costly than others and offer different levels of performance, connectivity and levels of software support.

Have you considered getting such a dev board? Have specific use cases for them? Perhaps considered developing one of your own and want to see what else is out there?

This presentation will go over some boards, demo some of them, show how to use or install them, what is and is not well supported and how.
