processor on it I got no power cord on

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:11,219
it but because I started to try to get

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,679
lower power numbers alright so many SP

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,690
32 module I use was from expressive

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,779
itself it's also to me by EF robot that

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,300
means mechanical itself as you'll cause

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:31,880
because an additional quarter of trouble

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,880
power real-time clock I'm from essence

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,540
what I discovered when putting that yes

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,149
in 32 is that it still relies on the CPU

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,120
however I'm not calling for the portion

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,579
yet so the way I could for SP 32 is

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,510
basically using the arduino style of

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,670
coding i rely on oh I'm sorry I should

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,120
correct myself I have recently moved to

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,039
the Xcode with Arduino Ancients all

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,890
right it's much better than Arduino IDE

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,240
itself yeah so so the real-time clock

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:13,260
continues operating while the main

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,350
processes shut down thereby saving a lot

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,270
of power but when the main processes are

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,600
shut down there

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,659
mean SRAM's are also clear of its

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,479
application memory so when the real time

00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,880
clock processor wakes it up it reloads

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,950
the entire cobweb this is the way I

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,590
understood from reading in the forums

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,140
and that message in rush of current

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,439
really comes from the flash chip plays

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:50,599
alongside yes beaten into not that gets

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:54,140
p32 itself the reason why I have an

00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:57,259
external RTC in my project was so you

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,509
supply a wake up line to the ESP that

00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,869
you flew itself I did not rely on the

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,869
yes

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,740
I thought that's really helpful because

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,660
I have am actually in the middle of

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,270
evaluating Wi-Fi chips would be trusted

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:21,900
I think I read about that and you

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:28,830
confirmed it so that was very cool and

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:30,900
VIPs Laura team us dynasty that's just a

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:38,310
choice for my friend we wanted to

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:42,300
explore the even later is the more

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:46,830
promising as it is could you expand a

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,320
space sorry but I use the TV and not to

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,540
me by the Terminator it will come in a

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,720
lot that is this small portion of the

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,570
spectrum yes we do use in the States

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,760
acting on UK as well Singapore would

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,580
things be yes

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,190
I'm familiar with all these I try to

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,959
look up on all these terminologies in a

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:13,140
website called 3G and I saw the release

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:17,069
matrix of the documents in rage over a

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,980
thousand documents so I got lost so I

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:23,090
rely on the modules ability to give me

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,090
what I wanted

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:31,680
I was very pleased that so you do

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,680
support America and see everything else

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,940
I do mean those little ridges and

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,410
[Music]

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:59,920
get some select two minutes on loops

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,920
again about a recognized University

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,700
lower but in our day to day

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:11,540
experimenting schools we usually don't

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:16,060
go beyond that battery so is every

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,060
scribe okay folks cool experiment

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,540
actually really like they exhibit a

00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,709
parent source

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,709
[Music]

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,070
like currency one thing sensible

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,950
about verifying

00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,370
something

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,750
so the question was is the is the laser

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,990
for verifying 86 thing that's common and

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,820
the answer is no is it technique I as

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,130
far as I know I had to come up with it

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,990
on my own and actually literally part of

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,940
the reason I'm protecting it here is

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,000
because I'm trying to keep other people

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,290
from patenting it the first thing I've

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,900
gotten from several people I've talked

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,850
to you is like are you gonna patent it

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,730
actually a little worried is I'm cleric

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,320
was disco companies and policies

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,820
have had everything they touch regards

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,150
to video but today are nothing so I'm

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,800
trying hard to like disclose put in the

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,230
blockchain that I have it there get a

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,740
fired date right I just want to not have

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,650
this exit like the domain of course be

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,360
able to use have you tried it yourself I

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,740
have not tried it myself

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,900
there's one of the things that needs to

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,000
be done but there are supers that have

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,510
indicated particularly a optical

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,810
induction for the purpose of like

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,030
maliciously attacking an MCU has been

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,640
demonstrated by Ross Anderson's lab at

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,740
Cambridge but it's on a much older

00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,680
generation of children and so one of the

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,060
things that needs to be done is on the

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,280
target gel that 40 nanometer

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,690
how does causes that you know extra

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,070
carriers are generated photons get

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,510
directly the transistors is enough

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,700
interaction to cause a bit

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,310
like that'sthat's a core assumption that

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,260
doesn't need to be validated but I'm

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,820
pretty optimistic because you know light

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,440
does interact with so if it will

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,010
generate cares and then should at some

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,990
strength cause a problem just you know

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,160
the question my head's like is is there

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,990
a strength at which like it cost a

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,200
laptop instead of verification or

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,339
something terrible like that

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,339
[Music]

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:56,400
the

00:06:51,750 --> 00:07:01,070
yeah so all the open-source projects I

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,740
see when the Germany are categorized as

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:09,230
products we a little dangerous but with

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:12,410
an open source project causes I believe

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,410
protect ourselves

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,820
I was bought interning at an open source

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,240
for drones

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:33,320
and around that time so what news about

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:37,460
Isis cruising cherry red tones to set

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,460
bombs over right now this was an ethical

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,140
question but then one of my might has

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:49,970
kind of gave me an answer then that you

00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:52,190
know it's worth the cost probably did

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,230
not phrase it correctly but it's still

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,740
better open source again so I just want

00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:01,840
to kind of ask that at that

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,060
open-sourcing project for building goals

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:11,210
results in not nice people using it is

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:14,470
it still an open question malicious use

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,470
of open pathway

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,400
you know once we put something out into

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,590
the world you know the question is about

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,009
what what if someone uses your project

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,539
maliciously if it's open source that'll

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,099
happen whether it's open source or not

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,620
when you put something out into the

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,839
world even if it's patented you have no

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,740
control over what people do with it if

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,060
someone's going to do something

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,229
malicious they don't care if they're

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,169
happy they don't care if they're

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,490
violating an open-source license either

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,830
if they want to harm you they can say

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,589
yeah Mitch Altman did this thing and I'm

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,360
giving him credit for my malicious act

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,860
that's not something I'd be proud of but

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,630
once you put something out in the world

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,790
you have no control over what people do

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,250
with it so I think it's really important

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,310
to think about what's going to happen in

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,380
the cultural and social context with

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,329
your project what will it best be suited

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,339
for and that's what it will be used for

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:11,779
but you know anyone can use anything

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,640
before for harmony like I can I can not

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,910
that I want to but I can take this mic

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,250
and start walking there's people on the

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,640
heads that's not what microphones are

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,630
intended for but you know I I could

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,940
physically do that but if I make a gun

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,899
clearly it's going to be used to harm

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,149
people

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,770
if I make a drone well we already know

00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:37,010
what the US military has done with

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:40,550
drones we started by a bunch of German

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,160
hackers and it was presented publicly

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,260
the first time in the first half a

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,130
conference that I went to in Germany in

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,450
2006 I think that was and it was awesome

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,720
no one was thinking that this is going

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,720
to be used to kill people in Yemen I

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:03,230
think first thing is close the most

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,490
important part of every open-source

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,440
license software or hardware is the

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,330
don't sue me cause like you know you use

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,730
it at your own risk so software in

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,650
particular is like this gotta be this

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,260
code has no pity because whatsoever

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,700
basically there's a you can't quite do

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,110
that with hard words it is hardware it's

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,580
like you know brick and therefore you

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,320
should pay me for it there's some like

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,100
you know you have to warn that it does

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,740
what it does but there is a limitation

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,560
liability there the other thing that I

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,960
would add is that a lot of technologies

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,320
believes almost every technology like

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,630
when we you know when we harnessed fire

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,280
we could cook food and get also burned

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,500
people on the state right you know this

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,500
was just this was the moment technology

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,600
came in the hands of humans technology

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,570
itself I think it's neither good nor bad

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,210
it's like water you need it but you can

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,370
also drown in it and then the question

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,130
is just you know in the process of

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,350
disclosing and sharing what are the

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,660
channels you use and how do you express

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,950
it and then yes there's a there's a step

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,080
that has to be taken for example to

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,760
weaponize the drone right there's a step

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,960
you have to take to weaponize gunpowder

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,730
is the step you have to take the

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,650
weaponize it exploit the step you have

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,510
to take the weapon ice you know any type

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,150
of things so to make it particularly

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,579
effective against humans and so if you

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,829
are trying to tweak the parameter

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:28,249
your technology to be optimally harmful

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:30,920
to humans and that's you know that's the

00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,939
point but if you just trying if you're

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,410
like oh I want to play on the high

00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,299
voltage circuits and I think it'll be

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,829
interesting if you're not you know

00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,480
saying well these electrodes are really

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,679
good for like shocking people or

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,269
something like this we just say you know

00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,589
this is how you do high voltage and you

00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:44,029
have to be careful and all these sorts

00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,079
of things and you put a circuit Billiken

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,699
Jerry a thousand bullets in the

00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,799
comparator and you tell me about that I

00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,170
mean like there's a lot of really useful

00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,819
applications for high voltage sources

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,850
and I think you should have that out

00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:54,850
there

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:09,250
so for example GPS doesn't work above

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,730
certain altitude commercially available

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,780
GPS doesn't work beyond certain altitude

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,730
so speak and that's there as a

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,200
limitation so that you know you can't

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,200
just make my site

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:31,740
so there have been limitations that have

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,000
been placed the question is do we need

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,620
those kind of things we need

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,440
certifications for example I come from

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,600
India we have passed a law which says

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,250
that if I have to buy a drone which is

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,280
because there a particular size I have

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,530
to register with the right now this kind

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,650
of gets in the way of me building my own

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,600
right I have to follow certain tenets

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,640
also not going for anonymity because

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,610
when asked to register my comment idea

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,850
against it and all these things so after

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:04,470
like do you guys think these are good

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:06,840
enough Niger's that we can put because

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:12,710
finally we are the ones who are making

00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,710
these by word and come up with

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,750
yes

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:29,080
so people are discussing in the audience

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,490
about you know should there be like

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,220
government regulations should there be

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,640
limitations to technology to try to

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,610
prevent malicious activity with projects

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,530
that we create and you know if we put

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,370
the limitations in then that limits what

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,570
we can do with them at the same time

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,270
limits the harm that can be done so

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,300
there's trade-offs in United States

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:55,420
there are a bunch of people dying from

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,870
guns all the time and there's laws that

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,750
people register their weapons in order

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,270
to use them and that has been effective

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,970
at limiting the number of murders with

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,640
guns of course there are people who will

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,910
just get a gun beyond the registration

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,610
also but it at least prevented someone

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,970
from being Superman going out buying a

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,660
gun and killing someone while they're

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,740
still hot maybe there can be government

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,180
regulations I mean if we have

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:31,690
governments we might as well have them

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:32,980
do something but yeah but these are all

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,020
trade-offs you know we don't live

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,940
whatever whoever you are and whatever

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,770
your points of view everyone will agree

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,450
we don't live in a perfect world no one

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,360
can even define what that means so we

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,340
have to make use of the world that we

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,370
actually live in and try to do our best

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,830
so if you feel that you're calling to

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,840
try to go push for government

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,210
regulations to limit certain kind of

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,200
technologies that can harm

00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:03,550
maybe that's something to do if you like

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,290
for myself I just I've worked so many

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,860
different places as a consultant in

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:11,410
every single place I've worked the US

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,840
military has come in someone from the US

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,780
military has come in and said we want

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,260
what you all have done this is cool

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,540
computer game can be used as a killer

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:27,460
helicopter simulator if you just give

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:30,640
customers and create virtual reality and

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,350
the US military came in and they want to

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,200
use it as World War through training

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,760
simulators right so you know like I

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,820
don't want to help to do that kind of

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:43,750
stuff but when you do anything it's a

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:47,770
new tool it can be used and therefore it

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,200
will be used because we've got 7 billion

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,480
people on our planet and some percentage

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,160
of them are very highly paid to look at

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,470
any new tool that comes out any new

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,750
technology to come that comes out to be

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,340
used for weapons of mass destruction and

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,330
those people worth of the US military

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,760
and other militaries so what do we do to

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,870
prevent regular

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,430
stop that you know this is a huge can of

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,470
worms right now we're talking about

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,110
ethics and there's no absolute right and

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,639
wrong but what do you feel you know like

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,110
you're working on a project if it's

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,490
something that you know is going to be

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,699
used for harm but you're doing it

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,740
anyways that's probably not a good idea

00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,660
but if you're enthusiastic about making

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,010
drones like these German hackers and its

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,260
really cool they didn't really think

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,699
about what it's going to be used to kill

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,430
people in Yemen and other places

00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,170
eventually you know I wouldn't hold them

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,029
culpable but you know we live in a world

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,170
where these kind of things are going to

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,139
happen so I think it's our

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,880
responsibility as creators to think

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,389
about that to the best of our abilities

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,350
and put it out in a context though

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:55,350
coolness rather than harm I think I just

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,959
added on the I think it's not just we

00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,760
should like governments release us but I

00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,190
think having this conversation and this

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,870
problems very helpful and then if you

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,309
see someone your colleagues doing

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,339
something that could be harmful on the

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,199
tape like you know maybe you know sort

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,270
of the data processing you're doing is a

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,160
little scary and creepy and you should

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,689
think about pulling that in if you're

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
just in you just telling your colleague

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,880
that might actually be much more

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,160
impactful than any like government

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,780
telling that my

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,819
is it ultimately comes from community

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,940
standards right and we have to sort of

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,559
as individuals just you know sometimes

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,910
just say hey like it's not like you're

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440
bad or something like that but you know

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,730
did you ever consider that maybe there

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,590
could be quickly where they could be

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,630
Patterson like this and then just victim

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,690
think about it and then I'm sorry about

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,520
fundamental optimist a if you just

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,620
ninety-nine percent of humans you know

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,820
if you tell them that they'll probably

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,320
do the right thing there's a small

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:53,110
percentage you going to do have to force

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,110
them but it's a good start

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,610
given the same trend of thought on how

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,750
far

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,750
and each of you share

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm Ventus

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,539
it's challenging hardware

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:27,130
[Laughter]

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:44,420
[Music]

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,220
I think I think actually if you expand

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:06,039
the definition of open source to like

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,169
the realm of like open source licenses

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,360
themselves are sort of like real movies

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,070
and things include like all of like the

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,320
physics papers and stuff from the 60s

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,490
and when people actually disclose and

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,580
publish things there's some like

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,919
incredibly cool stuff that people did

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,789
like in the 60s 70s and 80s and you can

00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,200
download the schematics and look at it

00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:29,350
you know I think you actually download

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,230
like the paulo landers design now that's

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,870
like an incredible piece of partner it's

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,760
so cool there's so many like what people

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,880
had to do is so little back then like

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,000
they landed people in the moon with like

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,590
two kilobytes of RAM and then I tell

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,070
people I will put four megabytes and be

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,070
trusted

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:59,899
to keep buttons and they hold it by him

00:19:52,830 --> 00:20:04,440
corn right that was gonna be my question

00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:09,269
can you expand the CPU and that

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,789
subsystem and be trusted because I'm

00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:13,470
either going to use a lot of yeah the

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,919
course just right human-like which isn't

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,720
like that

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,759
right okay so yeah great so the question

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,499
was can I talk a little about what the

00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,070
what I'm thinking about for the chip

00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:26,909
inside be trusted so the the logic goes

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:30,119
the define what we want to do with it so

00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:31,950
it's a text base for the Miami in answer

00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,850
voice and then you work backwards from

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,529
there to what is the right size of chip

00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,450
and you don't make it the biggest chip

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,879
possibly a basic too expensive right and

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,149
what you finally work backwards is that

00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:48,090
the limiting factors ran how much RAM

00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:50,340
you can put in there and so and this is

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,350
why I got into the verification of keeps

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,549
of Nan because a bunch of guys actually

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,590
working open fabs

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:57,749
in that kind of 30 nanometer range look

00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,669
for like a chip like for MIT megabytes

00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:02,820
of RAM is like a chip with this big like

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:04,799
139 here and then like 49 in the air

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,710
it's a to this big right so it's a

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,670
reasonable amount so so then once you

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,160
picked them to know it's a 14

00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,560
because it's like where the mask kind of

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,090
fall off become really cheap anything

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,140
beyond that the price starts to go up

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:21,940
again then the trend is all perform a

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,740
certain rate so you know they're

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,440
basically freest by the CPUs get started

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,210
be 32-bit risc by computer with some

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,280
crypto accelerators it'll probably run

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,570
hundreds of megahertz right you know

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,130
more speed than you ever need for the

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,040
applications but it's gonna be about

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,290
four megabytes of RAM the flash will be

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,730
off chip but then signature verified it

00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,700
pulled in so you can have arbitrary

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,350
amounts of offline storage and then

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,780
probably also integrated with me like

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,360
some ABCs of the ACS and housekeeping

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,100
stuff and that nobody ever try to keep

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,950
it very minimal it only is it's a very

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,680
minimal design just a big pile of RAM

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,090
and the 32-bit risc cpu with

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,000
architectures really open for instant

00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,980
inspection and then on top of that the

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,720
the next month on top of that is in

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,510
order to facilitate with the Silk'n

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,490
inspection every basically every

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,100
register gets instrumented with the read

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,560
out path so idea is you basically stop

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,570
the clock fire laser in there right and

00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,340
you say okay we have this pattern before

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,230
and after fight Laser what's the pattern

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,820
of all the registers you read that out

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,410
me say okay well the layers must have

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,200
been in this set of logic because these

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,920
are the affected paths and you move the

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,540
legs

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,600
so there's an easy simply out path and

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,860
then on top of that there's a there's

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,780
another modulus which is that they're

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,000
they're blocks even as a designer so I

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,380
Olivia as a designer I get a peanut map

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,880
of the chip back there show me where all

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,060
the standard cells that I design there

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,560
but for example the RAM itself is a hard

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,510
IP block which means that the foundry

00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,340
puts it in I don't get to see the RAM I

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,530
never actually see the RAM design so

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,150
they can put implants inside the RAM and

00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,770
so I have to harden against that so

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,120
before I go to the RAM I'd have to add

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,920
some things that go ahead and swap

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,480
around the address space randomly and

00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,770
there's a bunch of stuff to make it so

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,450
if you put something inside the RAM

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,310
clock it's not like oh just Pat over

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,840
byte 8 and you let's get like blue

00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,920
vector or something like that but it's

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,840
now you have to put a much more

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,340
complicated thing inside the RAM which

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,140
means has fun when you're larger which

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,310
means I'm going to detect that as I

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,650
think that's I scan through the device

00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,630
so there's a bunch of little tricks like

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,910
that that it's really more about

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:22,240
exploring those tricks and not so much

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:25,300
about you know necessarily building a

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,370
quad core a multi-tier there's you know

00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,060
whatever it is taking that a lot of

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,060
people are these days

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:38,320
thank you for what they well thank you

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:41,579
very much to the panel discussion

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,579
