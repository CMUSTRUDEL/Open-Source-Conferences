Voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant offer excellent SDKs and APIs so that people can incorporate them in their hobby projects and consumer products. There is still a prohibitive cost to doing this, as $5 Raspberry Pis are not exactly available at bulk. Additionally, size is an issue.

A lesser known, but more effective way is using supercharged micro- controllers like the ESP32. The WROVER module for ESP32 comes with half a megabyte of RAM, which is more than enough for fitting voice assistants in tiny places.

In fact, we can do a lot more fun stuff with micro-controllers because of their smaller size and lower power requirements. We can embed them into appliances like light bulbs and fire alarm systems, to give them a truly ubiquitous feel.
