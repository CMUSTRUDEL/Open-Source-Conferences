Pocket Science Lab is a complete platform that is fully open source in every layer; hardware and software. Looks may deceive you thinking it's another Arduino device but you would be amazed to see what it can do. This tiny device can literally replace a room full of electronic analytical tools with its 4 channel oscilloscope, logic analyzer, multi-meter, wave generator and many more instruments it got. With a PSLab in hand, you wouldn't need to know any software programming to use and take readings from almost any sensor you got. PSLab got it all. In this session I am going to show you all of it.
