Pocket Science Lab is a complete platform that is fully open source in every layer; hardware and software. Looks may deceive you thinking it's another Arduino device but you would be amazed to see what it can do. This tiny device can literally replace a room full of electronic analytical tools with its 4 channel oscilloscope, logic analyzer, multi-meter, wave generator and many more instruments it got. With a PSLab in hand, you wouldn't need to know any software programming to use and take readings from almost any sensor you got. PSLab got it all. In this session I am going to show you all of it.

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:13,950
for possession of dubious and you see I

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:17,310
am entering so I will quickly brief you

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,070
through our project this project

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:26,160
reversal under startup it started about

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:29,269
five years ago simply developing an hour

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,269
a very stable stage

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:33,920
we had this stipulation and currently we

00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:36,470
are developing an aversion if we had for

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:43,880
the diversion we are including an SD

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:45,740
card and improved our yacht bridge and

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,680
let me tell you briefly what the pier

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,250
step does we can talk more about after

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,610
stall

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,790
this one seems like an art you know but

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,820
it does very much more than an audio it

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,470
has a four channel oscilloscope you can

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,270
measure four different wave moves at the

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:10,670
same time it has a voltmeter as a part

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:14,390
of a multimeter and it can provide

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:17,930
voltages powers for circuits the

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:22,040
resolution of a 10 millivolt and it has

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,660
a programmable also and for digital

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,790
circuit analysis you as a four channel

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:32,540
logic analyzer and electronics can

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:37,760
generate sine wave reveals a triangle

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,250
waveform generator PWM wave for a kind

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,670
of regulars and

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,990
Martha was doing a report on controlling

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:52,680
that month using PWM Breda do superior

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:55,140
and can also measure a capacitor usually

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,959
see multimeters does not have this

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,370
capacity measurement but Pierce lab

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,880
testing you can measure resistance up to

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,880
Omega

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:14,709
as in an art you know we can connect

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,660
different sensors but the thing about

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,700
comparing auditory this one with an RNA

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,340
you need you know programming know how

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,260
to put the code and debugging but with

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,959
this piece of device we have two

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,360
applications on Testament and Android up

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,050
with that done you can simply correctiy

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,370
since whatever the scenes you want

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,910
supporting this protocol is a spear you

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,500
are then simply click on click on an

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:44,660
icon you can get the radix like what I

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:53,330
do have it cut it so some of senses you

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:57,860
can't see and it also again act as a

00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:03,319
frequency counter and this is our softer

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:06,860
snack we have a lot of application a

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:11,420
fighter button start a wave form a

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,709
hardware and apart from apart from that

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,590
we are currently working over your

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:19,789
project all you roll up its for braiding

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:23,709
embarrassing it will the hardware is

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,709
still a prototype it will look like this

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:35,240
this is how we'll feed data from ages

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,330
and then a preamplifier those weeks ago

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,910
and once it amplified it will filter and

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,790
then analog signal will be converted a

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,440
digital signal and the transmitter back

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,120
to let's say not you know anything you

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,210
want so that's about our brief

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,680
introduction you can talk more about at

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,680
