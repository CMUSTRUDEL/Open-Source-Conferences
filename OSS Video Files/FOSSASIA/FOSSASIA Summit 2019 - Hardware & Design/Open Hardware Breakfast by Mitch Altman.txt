00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,670
I have along over the world constantly I

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,220
have an apartment in San Francisco still

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,869
but San Francisco is so expensive it's

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,770
cheaper to travel than to stay in my

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,770
apartment for free

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,510
I also have an apartment with friend in

00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:34,470
Berlin and and I'm feeling more home

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,150
there but I think out insha'Allah Jen's

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,850
a really interesting place there are a

00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,790
lot of people from all over the world

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,650
doing hardware there and there's a

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,340
pretty nice community of people there

00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,340
who collect

00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:57,290
so Jen Jen's amazing China's magical go

00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,880
to the markets buy anything on a

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,620
moment's notice and they have pretty

00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,540
much everything there you can order

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,840
stuff on Taobao and it'll come maybe the

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:09,280
same day or the next day and it's

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,150
outrageously inexpensive

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,790
and there's resources there too

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,940
prototypes with an idea or to

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,600
manufacture a small quantity or millions

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:26,040
and it's all there it's it's amazing

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,550
resource so yeah I think it's great if

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,530
you're into hardware to check it out and

00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,330
there's some WeChat groups

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,190
China everything's under we chat I

00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,610
noticed that people use WeChat here too

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,370
and I have a wee chat but it won't allow

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,760
me to buy things with each tab out of

00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,760
China

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,600
but if you're in China you have to have

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,820
WeChat that's how everyone connects so

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,830
if anyone wants to go to Shin Jae and

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,800
hang out with cool people connect with

00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,520
me my which hat ID is just my name

00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,520
without spaces

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,099
have you ever have you had a commercial

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,360
company take one of the open hardware

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:18,120
designs and try to sell it

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,340
you know the weird thing is open source

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,450
is open source you know you just put it

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,750
out there and people can do whatever

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,100
they want with it so it wouldn't seem

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,040
like it would be possible for a

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:33,570
commercial company to take it and do

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,660
something bad with it but indeed this

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,670
happened once the way I've made a living

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,310
for the last 15 years is with tv-b-gone

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,860
heating that turns off TVs in public

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,290
places in case you don't know about it

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,000
this is what it looks like and this is

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,060
actually how I've made a living for 15

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,980
years making this a tool to help

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,030
and yeah it wasn't a business plan but

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,760
it's renewable one

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:06,130
and it's open source it's been open

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:10,450
source it's been open source it's about

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:13,120
a year two years into it I made it open

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,739
source I'll talk about that and when I

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,450
give my talk is supposedly at ten and

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:25,319
one of my customers was a bully

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:29,010
and one of the things I learned over and

00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,080
over again unfortunately is business is

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,670
part of life if you run a small business

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,410
it's part of your life that's a huge

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,660
part of your life why would you have

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,819
different ethics for running a business

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,660
than what you want to do and not do in

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,000
your life

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,440
that's absurd you know like it's not

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,930
like oh well that's his business it's

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,450
okay so anyways this guy was a bully and

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,470
I knew one of the things from running a

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,700
small business for a while is as in life

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:58,200
don't do business with people you don't

00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,150
like don't do it it's your life you will

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,069
end up needing to hire a lawyer and even

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,660
if you like the lawyer you won't like it

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,100
at all going to court sucks so anyways I

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,350
knew not to deal with this guy but it

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,959
was so easy he would give me money and I

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,410
would send him stuff and but he would

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,269
always try to like bully his way into me

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,669
giving young stuff that we didn't agree

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,700
to and lowering the price and stuff and

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:26,820
I was like know this but he was really

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:34,140
mean anyways after a while of doing this

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:36,540
he took my product tv-b-gone he hired

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,100
some really awful Chinese

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,470
tragg manufacturer to reverse-engineer

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,940
it it's an open-source project all he

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,710
has to do is download the plans that

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,650
would have been a fantastic product and

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,660
he used my name he didn't even come up

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,330
with his own name he said it was me and

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:56,190
the package said it was me and it was a

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,530
piece of crap it was total garbage just

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,240
see it it might have been on the market

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,110
for maybe a few hours before a whole

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,570
bunch of tv-b-gone

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,270
fans alerted me to it so I heard a bunch

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,860
to check it out and I talked to him he

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,330
said any what's up you know you wouldn't

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,150
give me a good enough price so I made my

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,890
own and like it's fine to make your own

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,540
but you're using my name and that's not

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,370
okay so maybe we can work out a

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,830
licensing agreement and you've never

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,840
heard so I had to hire a lawyer because

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,000
the third of the ones that I ordered

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,150
didn't work and the ones that did work

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,310
didn't work well and it was ruining my

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,460
reputation and I was getting all of

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,670
these angry emails you know getting one

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,990
angry email sucks getting a thousand of

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,720
them in a few days

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,850
really sucks mm-hmm even if you don't

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,710
know the people it's kind of taken

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,590
personally so mmm

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:50,130
I had to sue him to make him stop

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:53,190
because he's from UK that cost me 65,000

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,160
pounds because in the UK you can't get

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,700
your legal fees back even if you're a

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,100
hundred percent right

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,490
now so that lost a year of income but

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,320
but I was able to continue and and that

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:12,500
guy is no longer in business as it turns

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,500
out it wasn't fun

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:21,180
so yeah even if it's open source people

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,180
can take it

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,420
yeah

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,720
speaking of business so many people are

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,500
finding the

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,500
but in pain

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,330
they also angry angry miss mr. cool

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,850
right so what do you think is like the

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,850
most common mistake

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:55,250
yeah well there's a lot of failure modes

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,900
for crowdsourcing and perhaps at least

00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,060
of among the ones that I'm aware of the

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,760
biggest mistake is that people have a

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,650
prototype and it's way cool and then

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,030
they think they'll get crowdfunding and

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,530
they'll have a pile of money and all

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,520
they do is manufacture it and everyone

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:13,040
will be happy having a prototype even if

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,710
it works really well getting from that

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:22,160
to a manufacturable product is a huge

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:24,500
huge huge huge ordeal it's a lot of work

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,490
to get from a prototype to manufacturing

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,350
product and so but people without

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,260
experience don't necessarily know that

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,680
and I had to go through this myself

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,680
earlier

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,530
that's stressful so the thing I learned

00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,449
when I had my Kickstarter I've had a

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,490
couple of successful Kickstarter's ones

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:53,169
for this weird thing called the euro

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,270
dreamer and it's still a product it's a

00:07:53,169 --> 00:08:00,160
sleep mask and it has blinking lights

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:02,919
and sound music synthesizer actually and

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,699
it has a 20-minute sequence of

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:10,780
brainwaves playing a sound with sound

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:13,840
light playing of sequence someone going

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,539
from awake to sleep and if it works for

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,460
you you follow along just automatically

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:23,530
and fall asleep so I was nine months

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:28,690
late in delivering

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:31,870
and I was getting some emails but I some

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:35,919
experience by then as long as I gave

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,530
updates and told openly what was going

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,849
wrong even it was really bad news people

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:47,050
were fine but there's this deep inner

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:49,540
like urge to not put out an email to all

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:53,920
your backers saying something like well

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:57,430
just found out it's maybe gonna be weeks

00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,250
longer than I thought and of course it

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,690
was longer and then it was the delay

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,480
after that and there's all these things

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,280
that can go wrong if I delayed sending

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,640
an email for too long that's when I got

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,190
the angry emails and it sucked but when

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,040
I was open if I just gave an update even

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,300
if it was bad news every three weeks

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,340
there your backers you know they're

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,530
backing you not because they're buying a

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,680
product and they demand service they're

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,960
backing you and your project so if

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,060
you're open with them they're they're

00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,330
happy even if you have an urge to not

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,240
give bad news give bad news apologize if

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,690
necessary but you know

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,770
and honest and that when people are

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,020
supportive that's my experience

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,570
but the best thing to do if you have a

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,190
Kickstarter is to develop the whole

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:51,920
thing get it ready for manufacturing and

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,780
then all you need is some small pile of

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,940
money depress the spend button at the

00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,560
manufacturer and then you're ready to go

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,870
and then you can actually deliver more

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,870
or less on time and everyone's happy

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,800
you're not necessarily set up QA cycle

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,820
so we need to apply manufacturing you've

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,700
got a head in contact with your

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,470
manufacturer so for example you go Paige

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,150
bad parts but you're the one message in

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,040
ukiyoe it means you have to shoot you a

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,630
movement to the manufacturer so that

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:36,280
there for example and that's expensive

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:37,510
to sit down or go there yeah it's not

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,350
necessarily expensive but it's

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,330
time-consuming

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,130
yeah so you have have enough money to

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,560
eat and pay for your shelter and

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,240
whatever even the prototypes are gonna

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,490
be expensive you can even spend tens of

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,290
thousands even hundreds thousands

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,470
several hundred thousand on prototypes

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,000
if you're doing cases moles blah blah

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,680
blah that's even before you manufacture

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,080
that's true it depends on your products

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,800
your project might turn into a product

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,290
but this the total amount of R&D it was

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,570
a year and a half of my life and other

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,090
than living expenses the total amount of

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,960
getting this to manufacture product was

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,960
four thousand dollars

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,870
so the funding on the opposite side

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,180
tribal were like a relatively vague leap

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,520
on the cell phone and then you're

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,900
talking hundreds of million students

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,970
against their whether it's some beauty

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,890
what you build might be somewhere in

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,900
that spectrum your costs will be someone

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:32,170
in that favor right well actually even

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,500
cell phones like this perhaps going off

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,720
the curve you can you can manufacture a

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,720
cell phone for six dollars each in jail

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,980
oh you can get to that point easily

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,480
because they're all these bunny has a

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,220
bunch of vlogs bunny

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:55,180
Huang who's here who's supposed to be

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:57,670
here he has blogs about the ecosystem in

00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,770
Shenzhen especially the the phone the

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,540
phone Shenzhen became magical be

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:06,370
starting with copying poorly iPhones and

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,130
and it basically became an open source

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,280
ecosystem without licensing it just made

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,230
sense for people to get together and

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,000
make agreements and share with each

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,280
other

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,240
specializing some overlap and it was and

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,920
so now many many years later you can buy

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,270
all these modules and people are very

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,680
open because they want to sell you all

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,570
this stuff and you can create

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,130
it's amazingly cheap you know that's

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,630
just cell phones though because it's

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,130
huge

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,620
if you want to do something that's

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,560
unique that you have to drill your own

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,630
modules or your yeah that's of it that

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,500
can be super expensive but the problem

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,000
is if you just want to take the

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,190
off-the-shelf design someone's already

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,959
made its often though better than buying

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,580
your pre-made product or it when you

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,050
want to do the hard way then you are

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,630
probably going to do something unique

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,610
and then you start eating the problem in

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,320
there's the extra fun problem is if you

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,880
go and make it you design it make you

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,320
spend a while building a software stack

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,670
thank you sure what it's not simple

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,350
stuff I mean you're running the full

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,209
oacm through all the driver layers and

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,120
then you get it working and lo and

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:09,160
behold you discover oh that I would put

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,750
the extra tooth we had on there reveille

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,940
is no longer available you have to get

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,140
provision B but revision B is completely

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,300
hardly incompatible with the river

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,240
erosion at a salary that the cycle

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,890
starts again I'll point the screen we

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,510
had to ordering the supplier no longer

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,490
has it anymore now we have a quick you

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,050
between you scream oh wait that screen

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,560
isn't available in these dimensions

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,690
anymore

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,240
it reads on the case and it's like okay

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,650
screen or yeah there's all these things

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,360
that can happen and if you have single

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,820
source things within that company out of

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:43,690
business and pellets anything that can

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:45,760
go wrong Murphy or game prevails so yeah

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,400
so but there are so many things you can

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,270
do that are inexpensive as well and say

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,630
your project and I am as well rant about

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,290
this for just

00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:01,149
to crowdsource funding is a great way to

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:03,889
go it's it's you know relatively new the

00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:06,949
way that people think is the normal way

00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:10,130
to do things is totally wrong you don't

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:12,980
get VC funding to start absolutely don't

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:16,579
do that if you're thinking about doing

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,329
that quit now seriously quit now because

00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:21,800
the NPC's are the scum of the earth

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,769
there's like five exceptions on the

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,779
entire planet okay so they only care

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,519
about money no matter what they say

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,079
because they believe their lies as

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,069
they're saying it and they'll say things

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:38,860
like I'm not like other pcs I only care

00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,860
about you and your pocket I'm not like

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,170
[Music]

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:49,730
yeah well they're they're kind of

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:52,130
overloading but yeah and so they will do

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,610
whatever it takes to manipulate you into

00:14:52,130 --> 00:15:00,310
them having over 50% of your company and

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,310
then we'll make amazingly stupid

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:08,410
my power so they won't manipulate you

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,240
into having 50% or more of your company

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,250
and they believe that they're a hot

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,720
because they make all this money but you

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,100
know you throw enough money around one

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,720
or two of these are going to be a hit

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,730
and they make money and they think it's

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,740
because there are babies but they're not

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,120
they make all these stupid decisions

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,260
about your company they don't care about

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,560
it and then you complain and they fire

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,930
you and then they run your company in

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:37,980
the ground in all of your years of life

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:40,780
and effort and dreams and so this is not

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,250
just a personal experience it is a

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,320
personal experience it's several

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,020
personal experiences but this is the

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,430
norm this is absolutely the norm and if

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,730
you find someone who didn't have that

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,670
experience that is hugely exceptional so

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,060
find other ways of becoming profitable

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:01,510
first then a VC might be worthwhile

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,890
because you know it's a risk if you can

00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,440
get a bank loan that's even better you

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,390
just pay back the money and the bank

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,000
owns only happen if there's no risk

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,490
but if you're in a place and you want to

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,470
give whatever you're doing make it

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,180
available to more people there might be

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,370
a risk involved because there's no

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,070
guarantee that you'll get that money

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,960
back and that's one be See's Candies and

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,440
they can't take so much of your company

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,440
which were all

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:37,440
a lot of college in the community about

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:41,160
to give a bunch of examples right now is

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,850
there central place online that whatever

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,850
all of this

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,950
[Music]

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,839
[Music]

00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,879
you know argument talks about how to run

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:40,090
your own small business and bring your

00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:41,830
idea into a project and product and I

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,139
talk about what I've done

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,580
horribly wrong as well you learn from my

00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:47,110
mistakes and other people have done that

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,779
in their own way

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,659
Bunny's had some blog posts about this

00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:55,960
and you know you've done that - I don't

00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:58,360
know and but yeah there's no central

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,759
place for you this some hardware

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,039
accelerators used to have things like

00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,679
that but like I'm an AMA mentor attacks

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,539
but hack seems to be focusing more and

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,779
more on unicorns and you know what

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,779
unicorns are

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:23,040
so yeah so they don't talk so much about

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:25,590
the signal another way and so yeah so

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,480
people who go through this give talks

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:31,170
not so much out of a central repository

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,170
where they

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,210
boy that was a great talk

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,240
things like these think are super

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,519
valuable and they're out there it's just

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,600
you need to go look them up and find

00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,600
them if you don't know

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:08,080
the manufactory are also very well with

00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:09,039
lots of wrong information and wait for

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,360
each other

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:22,269
oh we could wrong but that's the great

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:26,769
flags the bull and then put the word out

00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:28,929
there and then I'll add to it hey so

00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:37,450
yeah another people will ask to it we

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:39,159
can put the word out more great but

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,200
realistically the way you find out this

00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,049
information is mostly like meeting

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:52,749
people sitting down sharing fears what

00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:54,580
about you if you want to do this oh yeah

00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:56,169
yeah like for 15 years of consulting

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,480
help with helping small companies with

00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:01,899
their hardware problems I learned so so

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,970
much of what not to do yeah because

00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:07,980
these people who run the company they're

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,980
they glue this like nice

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,830
