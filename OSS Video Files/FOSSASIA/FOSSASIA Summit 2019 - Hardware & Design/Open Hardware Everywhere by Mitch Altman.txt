	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
this talk I'm gonna talk about open

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,700
hardware a bit and this might be

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,220
preaching to the choir but I just give

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,920
an overview of stuff I'm one of the

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,380
people who made open hardware projects

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,250
kind of at the beginning before it was

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,100
really a thing and but I think it's

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,230
fantastic it's really the way to go for

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:28,050
pretty much any any project that we

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:30,449
might want to do but like anything I

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,279
wanted to talk about this because it's

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,170
very personal for me and give some

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,630
background I talked about this in my

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,379
little talk opening day so if you were

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,160
there sorry for some of it but I am a TV

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,190
addict and I say that because this is

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,430
why what I do is meaningful for me we're

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,949
very much a product of our upbringing

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,440
and it's not like we're trapped by it

00:00:52,949 --> 00:01:00,120
but it informs who we are in a big way

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,769
and in inventing I'm an inventor and

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,920
inventing is really about doing things

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,130
that are meaningful like we can invent

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,380
things that are stupid

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,939
we do that all the time but why would

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,680
you put that out into the world

00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,409
that's what meaningful things out in the

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,299
world and the reason why what I do is

00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,540
meaningful to me is because of my

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:26,630
background which really sucked I was

00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,909
horribly bullied as a kid targeted for

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,509
being an introvert a geek that wasn't a

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:35,420
safe thing back in the 1960s when I was

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,220
a little bit I still not so take know

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,350
but it's not as bad but being an

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,220
introverted geek being fat I was fat as

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,080
a little kid being gay liking learning

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,560
somehow that's a bad thing for bullies

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,550
and not caring who wins at a game that

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,190
was really terrible

00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,950
so being beaten up in school pretty much

00:01:52,190 --> 00:02:02,720
every day often as the gym teacher

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:05,770
watched but becomes to teachers anyways

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,770
life sucked

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,400
house later university vice presidents

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,110
all these things are bcz so my parents

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,940
were clueless they were depressed as

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,370
well and I was just horribly depressed

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,650
so I tried to escape it in television

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,110
when he of course doesn't work but you

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,760
know as long as I was watching TV I can

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,370
seem to forget about my horrible

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,220
existence and you know kids on TV unlike

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:36,330
me were like beautiful and they had

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,330
understanding parents and friends who

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,430
loved them and and problems that

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,950
resolved always at the end of the show

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:50,400
and it just made me more depressed

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,540
comparing myself to time went away and I

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,820
didn't do anything useful

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,500
I just ate junk food he got fatter I got

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,209
more depressed only to be more of a

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,770
target at school and you want to escape

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:05,640
more me when I got home and that is

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:10,590
called addiction and TV was is my first

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,340
division I tried a bunch inator - they

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,380
take away much more than they give so

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,959
that was as a kid and for the first

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,380
pretty much half of my life I went away

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:27,209
staring it is and now of course we have

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:30,799
lots of screens but yeah but eventually

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,900
by 1980 when I was 23 years old I quit

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,980
cold room I got rid of all the TVs from

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,720
my apartment I had a lot of

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,060
that was a key every moment takes them

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,510
and they were people throw away angry

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,480
Nixon I got rid of all of them and that

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,260
was the beginning of a long long process

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,970
of learning to live a life I love and I

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,480
eventually did learn to live life I

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,879
really loved it was a lot of work and I

00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,739
learned to I had time I could do things

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,650
that I actually enjoy things that I

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:06,790
loved I became good at it there's that

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,390
sign downstairs about spending 10,000

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,980
hours at any skill to become a master

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,930
you spent 10,000 hours it's something

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,329
you get good I got good at doing geeky

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,519
stuff and I helped other companies with

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,060
their electronic problems and things

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,200
like create virtual reality when it

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,520
didn't exist

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,950
voice recognition and computer games and

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:38,220
computer storage stuff whatever so I was

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:40,080
a consultant for about 15 years but and

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,260
that all happened from getting rid of TV

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,330
that was a huge you step for me getting

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,190
rid of that horrible force from my life

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,400
but by 1993 TVs I started noticing were

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,250
popping up everywhere in public places

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,720
everywhere everywhere this horrible

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,720
force that I got rid of in my life

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,070
Marketing at me filling my mind like he

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,500
does with stories that aren't there for

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,180
my benefit or any of our benefit it's

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,300
just there is so many I don't want

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,390
to need including political candidates

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,000
so I don't expose myself to that

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,750
but in 93 there were all over in public

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,920
places like who wants to watch dr. Phil

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,670
when you're trying to eat lunch with

00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,670
friends

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,970
or whatever that in the white

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:42,820
house so anyways that was 93 and and

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:44,740
then I had this great idea to I couldn't

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,510
get rid of the TVs but I could invent a

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,000
key chain that would turn off TVs in

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,640
public places and I knew exactly how to

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,820
do it and that was in 93 but like so

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:58,030
much it takes time a lot of time to

00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:02,350
actually implement a project so time

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,940
went by 10 years in fact and pressure

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,230
was building and friends we kept telling

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,480
me what you got to do this when you

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,740
gonna do this so there was all this

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,030
pressure finally I had to quit work

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,279
because I didn't have enough time to do

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,549
things that really

00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,129
he wanted to do so I quit work after

00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:24,419
saving up enough money to work on things

00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:26,909
including TV beyond and and I worked on

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,469
TV going and it took a year and a half I

00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,199
thought it would take like maybe few

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,959
weeks to three months things always take

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,779
longer but by 2004 I had TV gone

00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,819
prototype working and I was going all

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,979
over San Francisco where I live

00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,869
turning TVs off in public places and

00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,579
really really loving it and I made ones

00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,709
for all my friends who were helping me

00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:51,029
with it and encouraging me and we were

00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:54,509
all going around and all of our all of

00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:56,879
my friends friends were excited about it

00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,559
and those people even told their friends

00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,849
and they told their friends and it

00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,529
seemed like there were so many people

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,979
who wanted to turn TVs off in public

00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,899
places and like ooh so I'm like ah you

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,809
know the things I learned while

00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,899
consulting companies was how to

00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:15,989
manufacture things so I thought this

00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,629
might be the manufacturer as many as I

00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:21,239
can afford and maybe I can sell them and

00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,969
I it's a math if I could sell 5000 of

00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:26,339
twenty thousand I could afford to make

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:28,649
then I would break even if I could sell

00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,679
anymore that would be profit and even if

00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,719
it took five years or ten years whatever

00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:35,189
I would make a profit and there would be

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,709
all these people going around turning

00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,419
TVs off and that would be really cool

00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:45,389
and it turned out though that I was

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:49,349
totally wrong I didn't sell 5000 TVB

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:53,269
guns in 10 years and have five years I

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,269
sold all twenty thousand three weeks

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,580
and I would make a living from it ever

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,580
since

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:05,640
and I got invited to give all these TV

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,640
appearances

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,110
and New York Times and people bags I

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,610
don't know if you know People magazine

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,270
if you're not from the US but it's like

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,240
Hollywood gossip magazine about here

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:22,340
magazine it's crazy and New York Times

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,210
and front page of the technology section

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,920
and Fox News Fox invited me out and I

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,160
turned off all of their monitors live

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,640
twelve forty million people watched that

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,710
was so yeah anyways fifteen years later

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,990
I'm still making a living from this

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:43,820
project that I just made one for me and

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,380
because I'm an inventor putting things

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,020
out there are meaningful for me and if

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,910
you do that you put something out that's

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,950
meaningful to you if it's meaningful to

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,220
other people those are exactly the kind

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,100
of things that people will pay you to do

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,940
and that's capitalism at its best

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,130
there's there are other problems with

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,800
capitalism but that's another time so

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,380
inventing is starting to boil down to

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,660
three simple steps you see a problem in

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,970
this case like TVs all over in public

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,490
places and then you have an idea on how

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,650
to solve it you know our mote control to

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,150
turn them all off and then of course the

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,700
long process but you do what you need to

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:25,480
do to implement it and then the thing

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,800
actually exists in the world as so

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,140
through the years

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,720
an inventor I've invented things from

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,030
companies as a consultant and it just so

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,940
happens that my brother introduced my

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,810
brother he's a

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,690
turning and you know this is a Jewish

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:47,440
mom's dream my son the engineer and my

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,840
son son the lawyer and of course it's a

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,360
perfect match because inventors patent

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,490
things right that's what one does and I

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,930
never even thought about it really it

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,490
just seemed like the thing to do and

00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,470
that's what all inventors do and that's

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:07,150
what I did I invented with the help of

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:11,920
my brother TV Beyond and I've had a lot

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:13,050
of patents what inventors do and I

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,070
really thought about it

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:20,980
patents are supposed to be for the small

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:24,370
inventor to encourage innovation and

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,380
give the person who invented it monopoly

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,490
for a limited period of time so they can

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,690
put their thing out in the world and

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,130
profit from it unfortunately even with

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,900
your brother's a patent attorney and you

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,460
do all the work and under his guidance

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:42,610
of regardons it costs a lot of money

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,340
it's 30,000 minute you have to make it

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,620
to be useful it has to be in other

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,360
countries as well China in Europe and

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,050
translated all these languages it cost

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:59,680
me $30,000 US dollars but it wasn't

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,300
overnight success tv-b-gone and you know

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,230
and it says patent pending on the

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,690
package it got me invited to lots and

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,730
lots of events i'm an angel but somehow

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,270
it turns out that I actually like well

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,850
thanks Pete and I got invited to

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,580
to conferences and that my second packet

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,250
conference which was in Germany by the

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,860
Chaos Computer Club their 23rd Kaos

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,830
communications Congress I gave a talk

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,540
about tv-b-gone they invited me and

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:33,660
there's a hundred or something like that

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:40,740
location that was like that and and then

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:43,530
there's QA and someone asks kind of this

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,100
patent thing why does it say patent

00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,820
pending

00:11:44,100 --> 00:12:03,570
or patent on your packaging why are you

00:11:47,820 --> 00:12:05,490
stifling innovation what do you mean it

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,840
took me you're gonna have to do this it

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,290
was a year and a half of my life you

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,790
know of course I happened it there's

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,650
people out there only care about money

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,770
what if they take it and they they take

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:19,590
this away from me and and then they put

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,980
it out in the world instead of me you

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,750
know maybe the patent thing on there

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,940
prevented people from copying it when it

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,049
became an overnight hit and

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,049
[Music]

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,240
really made sense to me even though I

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:39,580
was singing them and I went home and

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,300
within a few days I came up with a real

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,250
answer which was to make it open source

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,820
open hardware didn't really exist as a

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,830
public concept back then but I talked to

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,140
a bunch of people and of course I knew

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:59,650
about open source software free open

00:12:53,140 --> 00:13:02,170
source was already our mess but yeah I

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,910
made it open source and it's been open

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,570
source ever since and that's been a

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,360
really important aspect of why he began

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,110
is successful I didn't do that I would

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:19,050
not be making living for

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:22,350
the old paradigm is really only for huge

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:25,960
corporations not for individuals of us

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,870
the old paragraph paradigm is like this

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,760
is mine you can't have it if you come

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,060
anywhere near it I will sue your ass

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,850
stay away you don't get any help this

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,770
works really well for some small number

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,200
of huge corporations that make a lot of

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:46,930
money doing this but everyone else can

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,660
not take part in it this new paradigm is

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,790
like this cool thing I did check it out

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,580
it's really cool if you want to do it

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,200
I'll help you with it let's put this out

00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,610
and do it I'm doing this to put it out

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,880
into the world and you're gonna help

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,800
 a great and this makes not like

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,050
huge like like for huge

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,850
corporations but it makes people a

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,580
living it makes people enough money so

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,440
they can make enough to do what they do

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,010
by doing what they do what do you need

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,900
more than that and it encourages much

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,060
more innovation people take your idea to

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,590
cruise with it they share whatever back

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,590
to you it's great

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,630
by 2010 people got together to actually

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,760
explicitly talk about how open hardware

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,790
there was an open hardware summit we

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,750
came up with a definition of open

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,770
hardware and you release everything you

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,270
need in order to recreate the project

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,769
and the only restrictions are allowed

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:49,699
that are allowed to call it open

00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:52,100
we're and use this logo is that you can

00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:55,369
require that people give you credit

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,279
attribution you will turn and they must

00:14:55,369 --> 00:15:00,529
share a light so if they use your thing

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,059
derive from it whatever those parts that

00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,529
are derived or what they use for your

00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:06,649
thing has to be shared with the same

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:09,559
license and then people worked on with

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,480
Creative Commons and other licenses to

00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,249
have four licenses that apply to this

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,170
and this is the one that I use all the

00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:17,899
time

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:20,329
it's called CC BY FSA by just like a

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:22,549
book is by this author this is project

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,860
by me that's attribution and si is share

00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:27,139
alike so anyone uses any of my projects

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,579
as long as they can be credit and share

00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:34,339
whatever they do with the same license

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:36,499
if the people I mentioned earlier took

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,410
my project and the first engineering use

00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:41,629
my name if they use my and the student

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,339
making Sabah they use my open source

00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,600
that everything was online they could

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,329
have just done that and I would have

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,509
been gladly just let them have use of it

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:56,449
but no anyways a way cool thing about

00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:58,650
open source hardware license is that

00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:02,820
it's absolutely free

00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:04,710
it's not $30,000 if you have $30,000 to

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,510
do whatever you want with it's way

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:10,380
better to do it open source rather than

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,270
waste of money on of happines also if

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,430
it's open source you get lots and lots

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,110
and lots of help for free from some of

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,850
the most creative engineers on the

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,800
planet so there were all these people

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,750
who did lots of really interesting

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,640
things and they shared it with so many

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,600
people and they share what they

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,480
innovated with my ideas back to me do

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,430
that with a proprietary project this all

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,700
all these engineers did all of this for

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,890
me for free of course there were a lot

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,810
of people making tv-b-gone remote

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,820
controls in all sorts of way and I

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,590
didn't get a penny from it because they

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,770
were doing it on their own but those

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,730
people went out and were super

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,110
enthusiastically sharing it with other

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,330
people saying look at this thing it's a

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,600
TV god I made it look at it turned to be

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,520
something like wow that's amazing and

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,500
then they hear about TV gone and then a

00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,920
lot of those people buy my thing and

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,920
then some people made a TV commercial

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:19,709
[Music]

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,090
[Applause]

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,980
[Music]

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,620
get a free TV commercial if you have

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,280
private area projects it's not gonna

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,860
happen

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,980
those are friends of mine family and

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:51,190
other friends used to be in a punk rock

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:56,250
band she did the music and yeah 30

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,250
seconds it actually played on the box so

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,000
you know and when you do open source

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,940
you're sharing other people like sharing

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,050
you get a lot of free will free goodwill

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,260
and you know proprietary projects that

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,070
just doesn't happen

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,809
but because of all of this it made TB

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,640
gone super successful and me just a

00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:22,490
small company with a few friends we all

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,059
still make a living out of it for 15

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,559
years and besides you know as people

00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,809
copy it and put it out into the world

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,100
they're putting my thing out in the

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,140
world the thing I put out in the world

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,059
because I wanted out in the world to

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,160
make people's lives better to make the

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,110
world a better place for more people so

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,640
like why don't I want people to copy and

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,640
of course I want people to copy it

00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,719
I'm an attorney he's off I want people

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,669
to spend time to use time of their life

00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:55,590
for things that are way more enjoy it

00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:57,690
that's why I put it out there the more

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,259
people that make my thing the better and

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:05,820
so for all these reasons

00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:07,469
who knows what successful one thing

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,509
though with IP law that I think is

00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:14,659
useful even though some of so much

00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:17,669
business broken is trademark so

00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:22,019
tv-b-gone is a name I came up with back

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:25,739
in 1993 and just came with the idea of T

00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:27,809
to be gone and trademarked it that's

00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:29,309
super cheap super easy it takes a few

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,639
minutes there's a form on the internet

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:35,070
it cost $350 and then the names yours

00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,989
using Elysee couldn't use it they can

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:41,570
come they can use my thing if they want

00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:41,570
to use my name that I'll license it and

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,480
but this is part of what protected me in

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,970
that lawsuit because i

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,429
reverse-engineered might be amused my

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,159
name that i got all those 80 emails

00:19:53,429 --> 00:20:00,360
which i talked about earlier for the

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:03,000
visual talk so yeah trademarking is easy

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,120
and very useful i can't really think of

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,340
any downsize for any project for open

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,009
sourcing your hardware project except

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,169
for possibly b2b projects

00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:16,259
business-to-business because it really

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:18,840
requires a community for it to work and

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:21,320
some business business projects there

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,610
might not be a community just might

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:29,070
compete and not share it may be like a

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,789
line in which the hardware is too

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,730
complex or the average let's say for a

00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:37,860
community built so I take my favorite

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,960
example is a cell phone we get a

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,320
community building versions of your open

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:47,190
source cell phone yes yes definitely

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,029
because there are design if you take it

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,209
an off-the-shelf thing from Shenzhen

00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:54,339
yes if you custom-built this region one

00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,499
specific product probably not probably

00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:59,139
excessively it's actually happening

00:20:56,499 --> 00:21:02,079
so self-owned again but that might just

00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:04,719
be a one with things but there are a lot

00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,759
of very very very complex open-source

00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:10,629
projects and there's no relief downside

00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,579
to what it can mean to a million dollars

00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:13,929
look by our need to build it and someone

00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:16,479
to go the competitive Jim didn't take

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,799
that they using your R&D then they

00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,109
produce and then producing it at lower

00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:21,759
costs than you and now you've lost a lot

00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,919
of salesmen and you won't recoup your

00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,239
R&D customers now by the way there's a

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,189
difference otherwise will be really

00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:28,899
small and cheap your investment is very

00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:31,179
small therefore you'll get it back very

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,949
quickly but if you're a niche product

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,599
and then someone completes with you but

00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:36,519
big enough for someone to do that

00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,729
it must be aligned and we both no longer

00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,559
viable right yeah that's where that was

00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:46,389
available it's worth it's worth

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:49,479
exploring but the the thing too for the

00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:53,079
open source thing to work with the you

00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:55,509
having the trademark for a name is you

00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,219
put it out there as big as possible with

00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:59,259
your name so people know with your name

00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:01,479
and then more and more people want the

00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:04,329
original thing with the high quality but

00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:06,969
if someone does go off and do it better

00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:10,859
and cheaper then you have time to do

00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:10,859
something else

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,760
but then money you lost in the R&D yeah

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,100
I think it's really important to not

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,290
spend two million dollars on our project

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,480
I know in some projects I'll complicated

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,130
that's just what it costs yeah if you

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,700
want to get into that market so for

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,580
example let me talk about this later so

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:36,230
I want to talk about so what happens if

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:41,300
someone violates your patent or your

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:44,870
open source license so if you have a

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,870
patent the only recourse you have if

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,690
someone fringes on your patent it is to

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:53,090
hire lawyers and go to court which takes

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,650
hundreds of thousands minimum of your

00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:00,950
money and months of your time and as a

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,580
small company you can't do that you just

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,110
can't

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,820
that's not a viable option only

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,800
corporations can do that and they do

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,900
that's how they make money is through

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,059
this if you have an open-source

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,520
license and someone violates your

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,820
open-source license the only recourse

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,230
you have is to hire lawyers go to court

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,290
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,960
on lawyers in the courts and spend

00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,910
months of your time that's also not an

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,809
option

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,809
but it's free

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:38,950
open-source licenses are free so and it

00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:41,259
is possible because you've put a lot of

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:44,139
goodwill into the world that you can get

00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:47,320
a lawyer for free to help you and this

00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:55,029
has happened as there have been examples

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:56,979
of this prevailing body that would block

00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,659
imports without going to leave or you

00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:01,149
can just report it and it's gonna be a

00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:03,749
lot cheaper oh yeah you there's some

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:06,879
football there's some tricks to pull

00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:11,879
yeah but that's only if it's that's only

00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:14,529
something that you so anyways

00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:17,710
there's lots of things that are

00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:24,220
debatable but I think it's really a

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:26,889
fantastic thing to get a lot of benefits

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:30,249
from it and you put your thing out in

00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:35,670
the world and you help yourself their

00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:41,490
people or you pretty much a win for

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:44,450
but so that's my rant time you're

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,180

lights color cans follow your lights and
