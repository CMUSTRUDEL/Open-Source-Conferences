Embedded system or firmware programming can be very intimidating for beginners and often they tend to drop it very soon, thanks to connecting wires across a breadboard and writing bits and bytes to processor registers using bit shifting and logical operations. 

Enter MicroPython and CircuitPython which let's you program microcontrollers using everyone's favourite Python programming language, no toolchain, cross compiler, assembler required. The code lives on your board itself and every lower level detail is abstracted. And if you think you can just blink LEDs with it, you just imagined tip of the iceberg. You can actually track the current location of International Space station and turn on an alarm when it is passing above you ;) . Quite Interesting hah, There is so much we can do with it and it's not scary. 

Talk includes Introduction and some example project showcase and can also include basic hands-on experience.
