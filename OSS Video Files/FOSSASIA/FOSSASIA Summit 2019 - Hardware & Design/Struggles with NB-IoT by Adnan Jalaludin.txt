Struggles with NB-IoT
Captions: 
	00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:09,179
all right so my name is a I've been a

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,780
longtime electronics engineer since 2003

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,610
a bit out of my hood so maybe I do

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,119
customized electronics for factory

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,550
testing so they my background was all

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,680
right from all these incentives from a

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:29,580
vision here

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:32,720
I also belong to Facebook of which many

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,440
founders idea to me and fire me

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:41,879
yeah and I occasionally or more like

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,339
infrequently give some talks or so last

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,100
year I gave some talks on my and be I

00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:49,680
would be project which isn't successful

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,860
despite all the years of experience and

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,650
yeah I am today to share you what be

00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:01,850
some difficulties ahead so what is IOT

00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,559
right so I don't is just a collection of

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,049
devices connected by the network to

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,560
mainly collect data and possibly actuate

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,049
our physical actions so you may collect

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,049
temperature water from a pond and maybe

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,470
there's not enough water you can actuate

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,810
it through more means to night so I use

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,409
any devices that is connected to the

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,799
Internet so the possible users ranges

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,710
from consumer commercial industrial

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,359
infrastructure projects as well so

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,630
consumers right we have all these

00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,000
variables of which Mitch has explained

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,310
some of them to us we have smartphone

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,040
equipment like balls power switches

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:49,420
kitchen appliances and all that so it's

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,580
on Expedia so this talk I give these

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,690
lights are from my previous boss it's

00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,190
why you see this yeah I'll just go very

00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,580
briefly to them right

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,540
so despite me being an electronics

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:07,000
engineer the only internet connector

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,580
gadget I have at home

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,130
apart from laptops and my smart TV it's

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,440
a light bulb that's all I have a phone

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:19,150
so my experience with Internet

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,130
yeah justice mom Allah but since I've

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,080
been reading up for to implement this

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,040
project I discovered that there are many

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,959
many more things out there so for my

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,060
kids right I have a friend coming to me

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,760
because he discovers that I can really

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,709
like annex he wants to implement that I

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,200
would keep project for his farmer

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,510
right so it's in a remote location where

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,410
he has water pumps and then he wants to

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,950
measure the water flow

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,950
quality right so it's in this form right

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,170
power and why it is the Nexus con so

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,780
readily available and you want to take

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,760
several readings so this is perfect

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,760
application for Internet through

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,160
wireless transmission and then he has

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,230
many locations wiring all these sensors

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,240
and gadgets is not so easy so there are

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,220
some considerations with this project it

00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,350
needs long-term operation running off

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,110
batteries if the batteries don't last

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,890
he wants it be chargeable also it has to

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,380
be in a robust enclosure so that it can

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,720
survive the elements outside so the size

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,570
is not main concern here although he

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,960
wants it small enough for portability to

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,360
is for installation so in the locations

00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,130
there possibly no Wi-Fi unless it's near

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,440
its shed from shank and we have

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,380
considered also the low data rate

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,360
limitations so the type of peripherals

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,730
it doesn't want to tell me right it just

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,980
tells me what interfaces he wants what

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:57,049
project so now they are separate IOT

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,370
connection types starting to give all

00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:03,799
this via t serial connection yeah

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,510
we have internet and fiber so those are

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,360
the ones we are not looking at we are

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:12,530
looking at all the wireless options

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,069
available there's Wi-Fi as RFID the

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,989
ZigBee

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,989
which is quite popular in a long

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,850
distance and consume very little power

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,500
they've Bluetooth Low Energy

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:27,169
unfortunately that doesn't do the

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:30,169
distance the six box Laura and linky the

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,300
cellular companies like SingTel and what

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,889
we have really is a thing called the

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,820
envy IOT

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:40,280
so what is n bi will key right now MV

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:45,880
iot isn't easily available to us

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:49,100
perfumers first it's only available bt

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,310
unfortunately that's not what we all can

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,650
go to 7-eleven and buy a SIM card for so

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,770
you have to meet up with one of their

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,860
business people and then have a long

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,210
chat

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:06,480
and then maybe get evaluations in cards

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:10,190
like the one I'm hoping he'll write so

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,630
what is my ability is that in I'm not a

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,920
cellular expert here but these are

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,510
things I've picked up from the internet

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,400
what this is that in the bandwidth given

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,950
a lot to them by the government for

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,190
cellular services your 3G and 4G mobile

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:31,050
phones yeah they take a little portion

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,540
to do low data rate transmission yeah

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,730
they bite they can rely on the current

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,920
infrastructure of all the cell stations

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,820
they have in the country or countryside

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,900
and use a small portion of the bandwidth

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,060
reserved for env IOT they're open so

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,680
these four segments are 4G LTE means

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,700
you're fourth generation long term

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,280
evolution the long term and revolution

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,790
is being a type of 4G which is prevalent

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,280
in our modern phones so you have the

00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,050
fast LD categories those are the ones

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,150
that are used by the phones they require

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,060
high data transmission rate to support

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,069
all your videos your facebooking or is

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,059
call video calls

00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:17,400
now the reason I ran away in this lock

00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:20,099
given a lot that - damn right she's got

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,779
never been IOT it just uses a small

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:28,649
subset of the bandwidth and limits the

00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:32,729
data rate - to fit within 200 kilo decks

00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:36,389
of there been allotted to them so the

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:39,419
data rate is going despite using the

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,360
same frequency band for all our mobile

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:45,809
phone support we can still squeeze in in

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,449
a tiny form of modulation of equal C

00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:50,669
spectrum to support narrowband

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,699
so they're using back the same base

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:57,199
stations there have already said inside

00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,839
the country now we have a second

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,729
category of narrowband IOT it's called

00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:09,270
the LT 1 and 1 so this is a medium speed

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:12,330
LT standard but it is also categorized

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:19,499
under a and B IOT so sometimes you see

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:21,599
this terminology and cap - M 1 / + bi or

00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,900
T so these two things fit in the

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,340
umbrella

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:31,410
for the usage of iove applications right

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:36,070
so not knowing all these inner details

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:39,340
we use modules to support our to support

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,490
our project that's what we use initially

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,360
we started using Arduino a shield then

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:51,720
we decided to move on to the ESP 32 as

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:56,669
it supports a bigger programming so

00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:01,840
modules are currently available the DG's

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:04,540
DG's XP yeah this is the one here Bodie

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,840
and another one called the same seven

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,840
thousand seven seven thousand yeah

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,830
so what my customer wanted in this

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,740
project was that he supports in all of

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,450
these interfaces including rechargeable

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,580
batteries and a real-time clock because

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,100
the ESP 32 doesn't have a real time

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,550
clock for so easily and also

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,550
kind

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,779
so before we started on the project

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,620
right we have to have a rough idea what

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,289
we're dealing with

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,579
so we perform two quick tests before

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:48,950
drawing out these schematics and then

00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:52,459
PCB so in the first picture we find the

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:56,930
same 7,000 C connected where Leonardo

00:08:52,459 --> 00:09:00,470
which is an Arduino yeah okay

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:05,149
this was my first travel the same 7,000

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,279
C version simply cannot work no matter

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:11,240
what I did in a programming right it

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,459
just wouldn't the network cellular base

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,459
patients and the one I'm using is from

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:19,459
SingTel right so it simply cannot work

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:23,690
we don't know why yeah we we found out

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:27,440
later that the see the 7000 C the C

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:30,050
ready men of colonization

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,620
all right so if you think I'm

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,730
experimenting with the same 7,000 don't

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:40,940
use this version right so the next thing

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:46,160
that we had was the XD right thankfully

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:48,920
my Leonardo has an XP connector on it so

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,660
this is a special unit oh by DA robot it

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,410
has to to stretch there to support the

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,579
DGE

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:01,220
extreme of you right okay so we got some

00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:04,490
successes here you manage connect to

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,069
signal and also to internet websites for

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,079
the transmission and section so we went

00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:11,079
on with this for our project

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,850
okay at first the mob you from DT also

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,870
did not work

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:25,890
yes so we had to use the X Pisa tests of

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,960
waves for execute right so it gives a

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:32,430
whole list of parameters that you can

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,590
adjust and difficult things that we have

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:38,880
to find out is we're going to get this

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:41,130
number other's name SMI okay so we have

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,260
to dig through the web not having good

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,450
support from SingTel themselves because

00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,610
their own application engineer is being

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,450
proved left and right so again we have

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:54,030
nine kinds of holes so we found out this

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,600
one was a stumbling block and also two

00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:00,240
more parameters which is the end mask

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,100
set for this country's also forcing

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,100
tells and transmission

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,819
right the second struggle is that things

00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:16,119
still didn't work as well because the XP

00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:19,869
that I thought was an early operation so

00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:21,429
it was a firmware 1140 so after

00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:23,109
upgrading through all the steps I

00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:26,619
finally started to work properly

00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:30,129
yeah so this is another thing that the

00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:32,199
websites and the webpage support it just

00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:34,720
don't tell you really be right so you

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,549
have to experiment for yourself so this

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,709
was the second struggle to many many

00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:43,779
weeks to discover all these things and

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:45,759
which we finally decided to so okay

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,939
that's probably that even after we got

00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:58,329
the connection things broke why because

00:11:48,939 --> 00:12:03,009
the same can expired alright so after we

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:06,879
had all our decisions kind of me we

00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:10,179
started to make a PCP and this was the

00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,399
first version of the PCP so my

00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,980
girlfriend yes is the development of a

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,920
product is not straightforward

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,230
just slap on things together is he still

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,779
there's a lot of testing needs to be

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:28,120
done right so this being the first

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:31,120
version most Ralph Ellison okay so I did

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,910
some basic testing I didn't bother with

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,810
it what yet so I just had it operating

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:42,089
so my normal CPU consumption was a 50

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:45,790
million years operating that's my sleep

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:48,639
but when we connect to the cellular

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,310
network it consumes activity 1 million

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,190
years so these numbers are important to

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:57,399
us because we won the product or this

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,260
project to last a long time running on

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,899
batteries so the lower the power

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:07,120
consumption the longer the batteries

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:09,610
will last so I finally did some testing

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,420
it works through the internet but when I

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,880
did the sleep book testing with the

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:20,580
[Music]

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:25,690
the often subject was good my target was

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:28,390
was 100 microampere so unless 200 is a

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,440
good starting point sorry I didn't have

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,720
a picture for that

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,930
but the CPU wouldn't wake up from sleep

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,470
today

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,970
therein lies another struggle then

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,660
everything works it's just as if you

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,660
won't wake up

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:50,500
so I could only demo it with my friend

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:52,209
running 56-million 1551 during

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,750
transmission there was a little

00:13:52,209 --> 00:14:00,430
disappointment right so what's the

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:04,949
hardware copy of some schematics okay so

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,949
this is my power solution for

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,339
electronics on this board

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,190
yeah it's only a portion of the Porsche

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,410
team antics but the semantics isn't very

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,069
much it's just one page so this is a

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,259
Porsche

00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:18,370
so my battery charger I relied on a

00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,100
benchmark

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,269
texas instrument two four one seven zero

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,940
right I spent a lot of time reading up

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:29,170
and configuring decisiveness I think I'm

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,589
falling in love with it

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,810
yes yeah I feel would be much attention

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:41,380
to the actual regulation of the power

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:44,730
right so battery charger works I like it

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,730
yeah it was great

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:55,639
the main regulators right I thought a

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:59,420
it's just so I just look on 16s or equal

00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,790
T regulator hoping we were regulate 4.2

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,709
volts into 3.3 volts required by the

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:11,110
system I felt a bit iffy so I just slept

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:14,569
on another alternate LD go regulator

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,339
my main concern for choosing the pub

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:19,550
regulator was in the quiescent current

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:22,329
the last quiescent current contributes

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,220
much less to the system current

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:27,649
prolonging battery life so this one's

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:32,120
not help they branch at one meeting and

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:35,269
operating however I totally overlooked

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,569
the minimum operating voltage of this

00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:41,600
believers hey I only want 3.3 volts

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:44,060
range a regulator shifting just a little

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,389
more and stuff to work right this one

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:51,649
will not work at all it was a bad choice

00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:55,130
right after reviewing the beta sheets I

00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:58,009
discovered that he required 0.75 volts

00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:01,779
to start operating it was a really bad

00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:05,860
choice thankfully I had LD go as

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:09,129
regulator and I perform a test here

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,889
using this one so in this design this

00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:20,470
first version the regulator was totally

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:21,850
useless right so now continuing the test

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,300
of the sleep mode right

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:29,339
I discovered that running from 4.2 volts

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:32,800
regulate the value 3.3 was even with LPO

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:36,610
the ESP 32 gave me problems so that

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,660
wasn't the whole story when I first

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:44,529
started testing I have no idea what's

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,589
causing the CPU to do not work probably

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:51,639
coming out of simple under like honest

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:54,100
people I measure the power rails now it

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:58,660
sleeps with 200 micro amperes it with my

00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:02,350
dribbles but during wake up when it's

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:06,610
restarted right there was a power spike

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,730
in the ESB 32 consumption all the way up

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:12,310
to

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,620
so you know that bill went through

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,650
forums and other people actually thought

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,569
that the same thing that consumption of

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,760
the two hundred million and it's not

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,850
from the CPU but from the flesh

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,760
supporting the CPU so what ESP could he

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,440
do does when he goes to sleep it kills

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:35,380
itself and on wakeup it reloads the

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,470
entire application from Wendy SP 32

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,420
so the initial rush of program committed

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,790
to the yet if the big dude really makes

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,010
the flash world and the flesh is the one

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:48,130
comes to be much of this power spike and

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,600
I observed on the scope takes about 60

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:55,090
70 milliseconds and then it's big fire

00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:01,480
so yes III to the module went into

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:14,020
format so there was a first bad design

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:18,700
right the second version this was a

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:20,950
possible solution it's from an S or

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,930
National SEMICON be more overweight yes

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:29,110
this is a VI part Mel its tell M 4 6 0 0

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:32,020
1 now when I look at the data sheet for

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,980
the power regulators you know what the

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,280
reason

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,230
so disinfect it it claims in this data

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,930
sheet you will take only 24 micro

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:45,650
amperes in some current what is really

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:53,780
small so I prevented it on the second

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:56,720
PCB yeah yeah and I mentioned it's more

00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,860
condition right consume only 42

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,930
microwave yes

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:06,740
later then I went on so I put that one

00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:11,260
that the old LDO bag just in case that

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,260
wasn't needed and this project started

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:20,390
so although the regulator took only 42

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,410
micro amperes and fire system between

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:27,080
you and all the supporting supporting

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:30,860
electronics right for the system during

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,050
sleeper will consume a total of 100 with

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,140
my friend yes you know a knee

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,140
replacement

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:47,100
before currently I have some issues with

00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:51,299
the second version looks like I'm going

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,639
to spin for third one yeah again I

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,100
forget to put a reset button for CPU

00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:58,830
that's very important when they're

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,950
developing sometimes the only way to

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:06,690
reset is to run the arduino ide and hit

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,940
upload again okay so there are other

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,929
things i found out by using the get 32

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,470
module only some lines can be me wake it

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:22,009
up all right

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:27,869
so okay point is not important now xp3

00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:30,649
from DG is very expensive 47 you

00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:34,100
cancelled all this so when I be such

00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:39,570
18,000 is only by when you want all this

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:41,879
yes so no but that's not so far not so

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,009
bad because I also made the reason is

00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:46,769
the free and I actually tested it the

00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:48,119
same 7,000 I don't know what it means

00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:53,730
for China

00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:59,730
efore thank you okay so that works with

00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:01,980
a simple SIM card yeah so now my project

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:07,019
is pushing the totally new direction I

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:09,259
am going to use this new 7000 in yes so

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:13,320
there is an even on the drawing board

00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:17,119
upcoming talks here and then another

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,119
reason is that rewrite I

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,789
is a downward voltage regulation

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,940
community

00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:29,190
so my lithium-ion cell a 4.2 volts when

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,179
eventually deplete and the voltage will

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:36,720
go less and less and then eventually I

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:40,440
will get enough voltage to supply to the

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,490
system electronics yeah 4.2 volts would

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,600
be my treat no problem 4.1 3.3 and it

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:52,950
just 83.5 goes to 3.3 the PUC regulator

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,169
is start to behave funny so this new

00:21:52,950 --> 00:22:03,720
regulate that I discovered or shared we

00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:06,840
buy this hour okay he said to me it's a

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,230
purpose regulator if the voltage input

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,330
voltage goes below the required three

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,330
country both people it

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,980
so this is a useful regulator I can

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,990
squeeze a lot of energy out of the

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,400
battery even if he goes down near the

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:31,560
limit of 2.5 volts so other regulators

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:36,150
exist but maybe expensive so it's my

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,010
project open hardware no not yet I'm so

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,140
frightened I'm too embarrassed it

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,910
doesn't work yet right most of the times

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,250
I see on the web of all these

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:47,610
open-source hardware projects be fully

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:50,190
working fully tested you know and that's

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,290
what I call the release so I'm too

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:56,850
embarrassed to put it up on the web just
