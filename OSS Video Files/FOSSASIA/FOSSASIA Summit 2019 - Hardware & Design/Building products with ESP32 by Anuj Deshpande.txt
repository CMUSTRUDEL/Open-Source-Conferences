Prototypes using Arduino and Raspberry Pi are a great first step to build a proof-of-concept. There is still a lot of work remaining after you have completed your breadboard prototype. Once you have finished your prototyping phase, you have to switch over to `production mode` to take your project to the next level.

ESP32 is the bigger brother to the awesome-ly popular ESP8266. It comes with more RAM, BT and BLE, and more. 

This workshop is about all the things we need to incorporate in our `production firmware` for an ESP32 based product.

We will start with a `Hello World` application and gradually build up to a full fledged product which will include

 - Hardware interfacing

 - Network configuration

 - Cloud connectivity

 - OTA updates

 - Creating and managing partitions
