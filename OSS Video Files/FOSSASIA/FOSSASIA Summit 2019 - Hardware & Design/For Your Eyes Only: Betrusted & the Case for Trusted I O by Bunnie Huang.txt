Security vulnerabilities are almost a fact of life. This is why system vendors are increasingly relying on physically separate chips to handle sensitive data. Unfortunately, private keys are not the same as your private matters. Exploits on your local device still have the potential to grant bad actors access to your screen and keyboard. This talk introduces the Betrusted device as a possible remedy. Betrusted is a physically separate, trustable display and keyboard directly connected to a secure enclave. This talk concludes with a brief exploration of some of Betrusted's goals and design features.

continuing on the hardware track we're

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:10,920
gonna bring on bunny bunny 1c Gio from

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,780
chip tronex I'll just let him set up I'd

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,630
like to introduce bunny who is best

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,600
known for his work hacking the Microsoft

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,189
Xbox he's also known for his efforts in

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,189
designing and manufacturing open-source

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,220
hardware including the chumby the chip

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,710
atronics and the novena DIY laptop a

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,630
home assembly laptop with all the

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,950
blueprints and schematics published

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,149
publicly today bunny will be sharing on

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,430
security and highlight the challenges of

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,440
handling sensitive data and this

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,600
obviously is a big topic these days

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,930
especially in Singapore on security data

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,789
privacy and data protection let's talk

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,090
today introduces be trusted

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,230
a device that might be a possible remedy

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,239
physically separated trustful display

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,739
and keyboard directly connected to a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,440
secure end clave excellent bunny over to

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,719
Bunny round of applause see if I can

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,189
make this work because now I know I

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,960
don't get the little cheat thing or I

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,369
get to see my next slide that's coming

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,960
up so I have to see if I actually

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,150
remember this presentation well enough

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,869
to give it to you off the front so I'm

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,420
sorry for the delay and also thanks

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,159
everyone for coming to here this is a

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,290
really good series of talks earlier and

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,900
this is a little bit of a non sequitur I

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,170
guess but I've been thinking a lot about

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,780
sort of the the mobile space and a bit

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,150
and I find it sort of like a little bit

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,040
crazy that you know we've sort of use

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,930
our phones for absolutely everything and

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
we sort of just take it for granted that

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,439
you know everything is trust where they

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,030
think Harish was talking about earlier

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,280
about the issue of trustworthiness and

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,340
that people feel like you know they can

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,750
go ahead and just you know on one screen

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,490
look at pictures of cats on any random

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,780
sort of web page and then flipped

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,450
another went to Google Authenticator

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,399
tokens and it all just stays in sort of

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,680
the right place right and as sort of a

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,930
harder guy myself I find people sort of

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,040
blind faith in these abstractions to be

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,869
disconcerting so how many people here

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
are familiar with Spectre have heard

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,790
about it okay most people have heard

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,450
about it so there's a there's sort of a

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,760
vulnerability that

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,590
has been disclosed and it actually we're

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,220
continuing disclose more and more about

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,260
it we're basically a sort of a

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,209
fundamental assumption that's built into

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,920
every computer every piece of hardier

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,310
virtually that I'm looking at in this

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,530
room has this vulnerability in it we're

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,019
sort of hidden machine state that's used

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,880
to accelerate your computation is used

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,769
as a side channel that can leak secure

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,410
data out other processes can go ahead

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,080
and read what should be in a secure area

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,640
and the bottom line is basically there's

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,830
a choice you have to make you either get

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,450
speed or you can have safety and and

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,190
there's an interesting paper here that I

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,720
serve reference on the right where a

00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,280
bunch of engineers at Google is sort of

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,709
written some stuff up about how sort of

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,299
proving that this could be actually sort

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,209
of a not fixable thing in the near

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:10,000
future this combined was sort of like a

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,099
very strong demand for exploits so this

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,380
this is a chart here from a website

00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,060
called zero diem that you can go ahead

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,950
and use the price what the current

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,769
market price of an exploit is so if you

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,690
look at the very top an iPhone remote

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,750
jailbreak with persistence is going to

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,069
land you two million dollars that's sort

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,410
of the market price today for one of

00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,260
those exploits all the down to like a

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,940
hundred thousand dollars for a sort of

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,329
sort of a Wi-Fi remote controlled

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,670
exploit remote code exploit or sort of a

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:42,489
bunch of other exploits in between and

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,380
so so some people say well this is

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,540
because like you know we've found so

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,190
good at security the prices you know

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,049
going up and other people say actually

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,790
the demand for exploits is so high that

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,109
we just can't crank them out fast enough

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,910
to meet that and I think actually it's

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,560
more that there's a very strong demand

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,849
for exploits out in the market right now

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,349
which is why the prices are higher not

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,269
so much that we've solved the security

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,920
problem therefore it's like incredibly

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,190
expensive hard and the other thing is

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,889
that there's no open markets for sharing

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,870
the costs of these exploits so people

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,430
the reason why people can pay so much

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,720
for them is not that there's a single

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,370
person in the world who's willing to buy

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,410
it for that much is it once the person

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,299
gets that exploit for a couple million

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,650
dollars you can shop it around to like a

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,909
dozen different governments and they'll

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,400
buy it off of you and you can really

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:26,080
make your money back on these types of

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,070
exploits so exploits aren't really going

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,660
away

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,310
which is why you're starting to see more

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,020
and more people going to hardware to go

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,820
ahead and split physically sensitive

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,050
data out from where you were you know

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,300
where you have in place where it could

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,590
be exploited in two separate tokens now

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,570
so there's a bunch of different names

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,580
for them like secure enclaves and mobile

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,770
trusted platform module secure elements

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,420
you to have to f8 dongles you know

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,920
people are putting different pieces of

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,900
hardware inside the machine or giving a

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,360
second separate fob or token to try and

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,490
separate out things that you that you

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,020
want to keep very secure the problem is

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,760
is that even though you've taken your

00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,710
secret your your course secret and

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,750
brought two separate Enclave is that the

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,070
input and output is still insecure so

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,530
people how many people here have a

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,970
two-factor authentication token or

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,280
something like that for banking or

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,200
whatever is you've all had to like go in

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,030
and like plug in another set of numbers

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,730
in addition your password to go ahead

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,580
and clear a banking transaction right

00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,470
the problem is is that their attacks

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,880
like man-in-the-browser where you can go

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,740
ahead and enter you username your

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,330
password and then once you enter your

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,980
token and those things are go ahead and

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,360
forward it unchanged inside the browser

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,830
but then they can go ahead and modify

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,150
things like you know the amount of money

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,190
you're trying to transfer or something

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,500
like that or the target that it's going

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,790
to and so that that token in your hand

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,620
just proves that you're physically

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,610
present in front of your computer but

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,200
there's nothing to prevent you from

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,210
making sure that you're actually doing

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,700
the transaction that you really think

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,800
you're trying to do that that token

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,290
itself has very limited IO value in

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,670
itself and so just to serve dig into

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,830
this a little more because to serve the

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,630
the foundation of why I'm interested in

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,060
doing what I'm doing these days is that

00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,410
if you look at this very abstract view

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,270
of a phone let's imagine this is your

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,440
phone you have a CPU you have a

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,270
screening of a keyboard

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,010
they're probably virtual and you have a

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,560
security Enclave that has some keys on

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,240
the inside and then there's the internet

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
which is you know somewhere out there

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,460
which has you know hackers you don't all

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,900
wear hoodies but apparently that's what

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:22,420
the icon is these days so you go ahead

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,890
and you enter your data in in plain text

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,050
that goes to your CPU because you're

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,790
human you read plaintext sends it on the

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,890
security Enclave it comes back and crypt

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,450
it to the CPU it goes to the Internet

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,700
the hackers can't get it everyone's

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,470
great data comes back from the internet

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,030
it's encrypted it's verified by the

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,590
secure Enclave and sent and just plain

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,870
text your screen everything's great

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,330
right so this is this is good

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,190
now say your hacker gets into your CPU

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,960
it's getting into your secrets well the

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,610
good thing is it can't get to your keys

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,980
right your keys are in a separate

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,570
Enclave we can't do anything but the

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,790
thing is that the hacker can still for

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,290
example see what's on your screen can

00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,160
still log what's on your keyboard so

00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,510
even though they can't get to your

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,820
private keys you can still get to your

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,850
private matters at the end of the day so

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,440
a local attacker are inside your device

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,580
can go ahead and like trick your phone

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,650
to show that you're in airplane mode

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,510
when it's really on airplane mode can

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,030
can go ahead and change what you see in

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,740
your screen for your website even though

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,450
your keyboard appears to start when you

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,310
type your passwords it shows a star star

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,169
star star star you know it's actually in

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,280
plain text I was like when people kind

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,690
of freaked out and they accidentally

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,760
typed their password on their screen

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,650
like oh my god my passwords now visible

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,840
to the world is like your passwords

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,550
exactly as visible to the computer you

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,540
know if let's star star star star as if

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,340
it was showing the characters on your

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,650
screen it's just that last little bit is

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,440
showing you same thing for your screens

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,620
and swipes and taps on the screen and so

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,000
even though you know your keys may be

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,030
secure at the end of day what you do

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,710
with the keys is not so a key thing to

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,360
remember is that private keys are not

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,370
the same thing as your private matters

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,410
even though your keys are safe your

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,810
secret chance may not be secret and this

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,340
has caused me to sort of stay up at

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,360
night a little bit you know much worried

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,039
such hack and so my kind of proposed

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,690
solution so this is what I'm going to

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,890
talk about now serve like where and this

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,050
player isn't bringing up here's I want

00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,510
to sort of gather feedback and get I you

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,590
know ideas and make sure I'm not

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,169
approaching this wrong way is a solution

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,060
called be trusted and so the idea is to

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,340
build a machine that's basically a

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,830
secure Enclave chip that's directly

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,950
connected to a simple trustful screen

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,360
and a real trust able keyboard okay and

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,770
what do I mean by a simple trust will

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,990
screen so I've gone and kind of

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,700
canvassed a bunch of screens I found for

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,979
example an LCD screen that's a simple

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,839
black and white memory LCD from sharp it

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,700
has no silicon chips in the screen

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,159
actually all the electronics are built

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,659
into the glass of the screen if you hold

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,339
it under a microscope and you look at it

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,350
under 40 X zoom you can actually see

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,670
like the flip-flops and the gates that

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,010
compose the data that routes to this

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,450
screen so there's no silicon chips

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,760
there's no place to hide something that

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,390
I don't know what's going beeping the

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,040
secure Enclave and the pixels

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,160
going to my eyes I can actually inspect

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,080
it optically when I say a trustful

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,790
Keeper I mean like a physical keyboard a

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,810
lot of people love virtual keyboards and

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,310
things like that but how do you know

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,870
what what you're tapping and where it's

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,610
going when you go ahead and build a

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,050
physical keyboard there's real wires you

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,700
can look at them they go to the Enclave

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,900
there's no nothing in between if you're

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,760
really paranoid you look at an x-ray

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,530
make sure there's nothing going on

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,020
there's no silicon chips other than the

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,430
silicon that you expect to be there so

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,080
the idea is to create a secure Enclave

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,750
that's connected as directly as possible

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,180
to things that I as a human being can

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,950
individually evaluate and determine

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,390
what's going on and can relate to me

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,990
human relevant stuff with not just

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,610
cryptographic keys and so the idea is

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,530
then to create you know sort of split

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,240
off your most important private matters

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,410
and stick them into this Enclave and

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,570
this is where things get a little bit

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,580
tricky business a balancing act between

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,970
the human-computer interface and

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,740
complexity so today's two FA tokens and

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,330
stuff like that they're by far to sort

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,790
of on the simplistic side of things they

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,380
have a very simple inflexible interface

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,630
it's all hardware it's very hard to

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,370
attack a very minimal attack surface but

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,290
doesn't really do enough I think to

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,790
secure things on the other hand you have

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,620
web browsers right which are great

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,720
they're powerful they're feature Bowl

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,610
but basically as far as I'm concerned

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,320
they're an intractable attack surface

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,910
like people just keep on finding export

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,200
after exploit and all the different

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,000
features that get packed into these

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,380
things and so sort of right in the

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,050
middle is where I want to sort of

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,060
balance this device or just enough and

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,790
no more with the securable attack

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,770
surface and so focus is going to be very

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,720
important and this is where I'm trying

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,700
to figure out you know am i covering the

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,680
primary use cases that really need to be

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,540
covered so at the at the moment that the

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,300
strong man is to look at text-based chat

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,700
so sort of like a signal like text only

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,410
chat but very importantly it has Unicode

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,000
support and multilingual irony it's not

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,650
everyone speaks English right now

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,330
everyone reads left-to-right not

00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,460
everyone uses the you know Latin

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,590
characters so this is gonna have to be

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,660
meet so put some support for bitmaps and

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,190
this is even even within the context of

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,130
us here Enclave this is a very very

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,310
large project I think and then on top of

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,390
that you know not everyone in the world

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,490
reads and writes right there's a lot of

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,650
people who I think want security who may

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,090
be illiterate or find it inconvenient to

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,040
type on the phone and so I think voice

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,570
chat is also going to be an important

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,890
sort of incorporate into it so in

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,720
synchronous messaging people think

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,130
people sort of talk leave a message and

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,190
they listen back and forth like a wee

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,410
chat style thing is going to be the

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,410
Minimum Viable Product real-time voice

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,430
call could also be cool other people

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,960
have been like yeah banking and

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,010
cryptocurrency I didn't see any reason

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,690
why you couldn't do that sort of stuff

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,150
on here that probably fits in the

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:32,150
Enclave but that's not sort of my in

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:35,090
inside my MVP but for example no browser

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,830
no games no video no social media no App

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,970
Store that's that all introduces too

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,130
much of an attack surface to lock down

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,010
importantly be trusted open software is

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,560
open hardware and one thing I think I'd

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,200
like to sort of try to take on is open

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,000
silicon right so try to enable a new

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,500
level of transparency for finding and

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,810
mitigating vulnerabilities so as I

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,490
talked about earlier we have the issue

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,170
of spectra right and part of the reason

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,210
why Specter is so intractable is that

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,830
all the CPUs that we rely upon are fully

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,720
closed source so even when people think

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,040
that they've found a way to patch around

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,420
the branching vulnerabilities there's

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,370
all this hidden machine state that you

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,720
can't find and so an attacker can go

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,150
ahead and dig through at the hidden

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,940
machine state and and leverage it to go

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,550
ahead and make an exploit so bite bite

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,650
sort of like making the the functional

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:25,070
level transparent hopefully we can find

00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,660
what these sort of exploits are what

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,370
open silicon doesn't get you though

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,020
importantly though is it doesn't prevent

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,630
what what's the time of check the time

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,100
of use exploit that exists in the supply

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,840
chain so you can go ahead and say we're

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,040
gonna build an open fab and check the

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,900
mass and all sort of stuff

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,370
between you and that fab is like some

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,660
customs inspectors a quarry or

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,340
distribute wherever it is those guys can

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,870
go ahead and swap out your silicon so a

00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,880
lot of people say we should build open

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,290
fabs I don't think that actually solves

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,410
the trustable problem that we're looking

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,020
to solve and so really more the the

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,360
concept is to go to verifiable silicon

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,240
so in to build the silicon with features

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,410
that assist users to go ahead and verify

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,690
it without having to have a scanning

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,060
electromicroscope so the basic idea is

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,980
to put features in then and there where

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,600
you fire a laser like an optical laser

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,730
through a regular optical microscope

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,290
into the chip which disturbs some of the

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,240
transistors is going to sturb a large

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,550
number of these are 40 nanometers those

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,410
are really tiny compared to a photon but

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,910
you go ahead and you just serve a group

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,310
of them and you read out the syndrome

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,930
from

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,759
from what happened you say okay well it

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,980
must be this cluster of logic late

00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,560
gates located here you're going to shift

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,029
left by you know sort of a half a micron

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,889
or something like that you fire again

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,839
and you keep on scanning across the chip

00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,459
and say okay all the gates are where I

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,559
expect them to be this is a chip that I

00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,670
fabbed out this is a chip that expect to

00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,980
have and it's done in a non-destructive

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,180
fashion so you have confidence that the

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,589
chip that you have in your hand is

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,040
actually the chip that you intended to

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:48,959
be running your coat

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,370
and so because encrypt be trusted

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,660
encrypts all of his communications you

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,220
can go ahead and use it safely with the

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,899
existing Wi-Fi hotspots you don't have

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,519
to build it into a phone so I'm not

00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,600
looking to build a phone right I'm

00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,819
looking to build something that goes

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,290
ahead and this essentially uses a

00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,180
security modified SDIO for his

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,040
communications again talk to any number

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,009
of physical layers initially it's going

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,509
to be Wi-Fi and then you know finally

00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:12,059
they do is to try to build this as a

00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:13,829
protected place for your private matters

00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,620
just so as to sort of make it a little

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:19,379
more concrete I have a kind of a

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,420
tentative development plan where there's

00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,850
an alpha phase where we're spending a

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,230
lot of time with an FPGA looking at what

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,269
the hardware looks like looking at the

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,129
RTL looking at the security primitives

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,779
it's not going to be what's called evil

00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,059
made resistance so if someone gets the

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,589
hold of the FPGA prototype physically

00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,569
they can still extract your keys but the

00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:40,230
idea is to make it very strong from

00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:42,089
remote codecs plates and in parallel

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,370
that sort of doing verification of the

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,050
optical fault and induction methods for

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,730
the silicon probably takes a couple

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,889
years and maybe this is sort of thing

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,870
that you can crowdfund but then when we

00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,129
go into sort of the sort of the ASIC

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,139
based system so the one we're actually

00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:57,569
spinning chips it's another level of

00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,759
money that's required so maybe partially

00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:01,050
crowdfunding Bowl but probably looking

00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,399
for fundraising and grants but this

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,679
would allow us to do something that's

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,040
truly sort of really secure against evil

00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:10,920
Amade has you user viable verifiable

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,540
silicon and then by going to a full ASIC

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,220
you can actually make it very thin and

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,629
very small so it's not a burden for you

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,800
to carry around so the idea is like this

00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:18,300
concept here is like about three and a

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,279
half millimeters thick so you can sort

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,569
of just stick it in the case of your

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,069
phone or in the back side of your phone

00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:24,720
and always have your secrets with you

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:28,769
and not have to carry around a really

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,910
big clunky extra device so thanks

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,690
everyone for sort of listening to this

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,830
part of

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,570
and I'm here today to tell you about

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,430
this is I want to hear your feedback

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,200
this is just a proposal everything

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,850
here's renderings none of this exists I

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,110
have some little pieces of hardware

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,550
where I'm testing circuits and stuff

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,140
like that but nothing has really come

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,400
together and I'm also looking for

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,040
developers who are interested in

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,040
potentially working on this Thanks

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,070
Thanks

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,070
