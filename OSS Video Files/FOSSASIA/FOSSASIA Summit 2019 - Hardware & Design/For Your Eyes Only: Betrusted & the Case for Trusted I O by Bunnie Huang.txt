Security vulnerabilities are almost a fact of life. This is why system vendors are increasingly relying on physically separate chips to handle sensitive data. Unfortunately, private keys are not the same as your private matters. Exploits on your local device still have the potential to grant bad actors access to your screen and keyboard. This talk introduces the Betrusted device as a possible remedy. Betrusted is a physically separate, trustable display and keyboard directly connected to a secure enclave. This talk concludes with a brief exploration of some of Betrusted's goals and design features.
