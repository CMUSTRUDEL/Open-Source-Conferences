to keep things going we're gonna move

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,090
forward with Mitch Othman who is quite a

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,690
known name by his title as CEO of open

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,240
hardware creator please do come on stage

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,710
briefly introduced Mitch majors from San

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,810
Francisco and he's a SAN francisco-based

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,480
hacker and inventor best known for

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,400
creating the tv-b-gone as featured

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,560
speaker at hacker conferences an

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,359
international expert on the hacker space

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,029
movement and also for teaching

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,579
introductory electronic workshops so

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,890
quite a good background he's also chief

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,010
scientist and CEO of corn fields

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,040
electronics so Mitch joins us today to

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,120
talk on open-source hardware and on

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,579
education there we go so this is my

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,950
contact info please feel free to contact

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,940

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,360
people any way that I can and I'm gonna

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,500
go over oh wait actually okay if I took

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:10,619
a photo you'll be on the internet

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:12,600
forever you know so great I'm gonna go

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,270
over just really briefly a little bit

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,140
about my background because it's

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,110
relevant for what I'm going to talk

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,240
about and everything I do because I

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,670
think it's really important that we do

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,140
things because it's meaningful to us and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,900
this is the background of why stuff's

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,450
meaningful for me I grew up being

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,400
totally bullied every day in school

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,920
getting beaten up often while a gym

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,710
teacher watched and you know like life

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,420
sucked and it was total hell I tried to

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:46,590
escape into television television of

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,009
course that never works so I just time

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,380
went away

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,020
I watched the screen and time went away

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,600
and I got fat and didn't learn anything

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,280
and that made me more of a target only

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,009
to want to escape into TV again when I

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,500
got home and that's called addiction and

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,689
it was a long road and partly because of

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,459
teachers supporting me and I am talking

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,610
about education as well as open hardware

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,530
today teachers are super super important

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,320
and with the help of them and other

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,180
aspects of life I ended up quitting TV

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,360
and getting getting rid of it in my home

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,780
and that was a first step in learning to

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,090
live a life I loved which was a long

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:34,980
road but basically that was the first

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:37,810
half of my life okay so by the year 2003

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,690
TVs were popping up everywhere in public

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,150
places this force that I got rid of from

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,250
my life was invading me again everywhere

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,230
I went in public can you remember a time

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,620
can any of you remember a time when TVs

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,390
were not in public places it used to be

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,860
the case but they were all over in

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,000
public places I couldn't do anything

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,570
about it but I could invent a TV remote

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,580
control that could turn them all off so

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:08,410
I did and it was really fun going around

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,570
turning TVs off and it turned out a lot

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,990
of people really liked it and I saw an

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,820
opportunity so I made a bunch of them in

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:19,989
2004 was the first day of sales and I

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:23,140
sold so many that my website crashed and

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,060
I was on National Public Radio in the US

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,030
and New York Times and the front page of

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,680
the technology section I was invited to

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:36,040
Fox Fox to turn off all of the

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,560
TV monitors in their studio Wow a lot 14

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,820
million people watched anyways it was

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,150
quite a beginning it changed my life

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,150
forever for the better and 15 years

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:49,090
later I'm still making a living from

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,519
this totally bizarre project that I just

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,519
did because I wanted one for me

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:03,830
Thanks so I got invited to a lot of

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,830
really interesting events because of

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,330
this including hacker conferences which

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,180
I never really thought of before but

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,710
hacker conferences were totally amazing

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,570
I mean here we're pretty much in one

00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,010
right now where there's lots and lots of

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,320
people all sharing what they love

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,510
wanting to learn from each other and I

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,390
gave a talk on TV begone and this is my

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,400
second hacker conference of the 23rd

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,250
Kaos communications Congress which was

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,430
in Berlin at the time and after the

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,060
conference people were like what is this

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,740
a patent on that patent that gets in the

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,870
way of innovation why are you doing that

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,430
and I'm like well I'm an inventor my

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,930
brother's a patent attorney of course

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,960
that's what inventors do and I'm like

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,150
but but but but but I don't know maybe

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,310
someone will take the idea and only sell

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,020
it for money and anyways it didn't

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,390
really make sense all the little things

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,530
in my mind to justify it didn't make

00:04:53,390 --> 00:05:02,620
sense and so afterwards I made it

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:05,570
open-source that was in 2007 and

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,970
open-source hardware really didn't exist

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,840
at the time open-source software of

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,340
course did but taking those same contact

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,070
concepts and applying it to hardware

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,990
made a lot of sense all these people all

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,610
over the world started helping me and

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,380
they were helping me already so it was

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,330
essentially open-source except for that

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,090
patent thing in the way getting rid of

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,560
that made even more people help and then

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,180
all these people that made it I didn't

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,090
make any money from that but all those

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,190
people called everybody about how

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,110
incredibly cool this thing is and that's

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,100
PR that as those teeny little company I

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,990
could not afford and of course why am I

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,520
doing this

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,620
I'm doing this so that people will turn

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,880
off TVs in public places and everywhere

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,310
and have more time and live better lives

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,170
and when it's open-source more and more

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,960
people are turning TVs off and making

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,870
the world a better place for everybody

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,790
so that worked really really well

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,940
also what hacker conferences I got

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,040
inspired to start one of the early

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,810
hacker spaces in the United States along

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,490
with a few other people we started some

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,940
of the early hacker spaces in the United

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,040
States we all helped each other

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,380
and we helped a lot of others once they

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,610
saw that we were successful this start

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,170
more and it started this whole

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,630
hackerspace movement and now there's

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,490
thousands in the world and one of the

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,710
things I did at Noisebridge

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,270
starting really small it's teaching

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,090
people to solder one of the things I

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,890
love and that grew pretty big and I'll

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,200
be teaching soldiering here if anyone

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,760
wants to join it's tons of fun and of

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,560
course if I'm teaching soldiering I want

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,600
to have cool things for people to build

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,850
so I created a lot of open-source kits

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,310
for people to make first one being of

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,790
course tv-b-gone kit which turns off TVs

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,500
at 50 meters away and it's it's just

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,720
tons of fun all these things are for

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,900
beginners but cool enough for anyone to

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,960
make I made a comic book which of course

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,610
is also free and opensource anyone can

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,290
download it for free in the language of

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,730
your choice this is what happens when

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,270
you make things open-source people make

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,080
it cooler including other languages so

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,810
hackerspaces are these amazing

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,760
environments they're places with doing

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,250
anything not just tech but also lots of

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,810
art and other things but the main thing

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,810
is there's a community of people

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,340
supporting each other

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,020
encouraging each other to explore and do

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,620
things that are meaningful for each

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,660
person and when people find projects

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,520
that are meaningful of course they want

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,960
to put all their time and energy into it

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,460
and they get excited about it and

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,550
they're motivated to learn all these

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,720
things that they don't know that are

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,090
getting in the way of making their

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,770
projects even better and so people learn

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,050
more and more in order to make their

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,050
project as awesome as possible and that

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,560
is what project-based learning is all

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,630
about and why more and more starting

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,700
small but if it's growing exponentially

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,200
its growing growing it's kind of flat

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,770
but it's gonna take off and it's

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,930
starting I think kind of right here now

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:10,980
it's highly motivating for people to

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:14,040
learn and you know one of the things I

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,170
teach is soldering and electronics it's

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,979
it's really not a big deal I mean but

00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:22,300
look they're happy

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,430
you know they're just making a blinky

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,960
light there but they're happy and you

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,699
know even if these people never saw her

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,650
again like this guy who made one of my

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,330
brain machines he may never make

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,800
anything with electronics again or maybe

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,690
he will maybe he's gonna go off and

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,729
become an electronics person because of

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,800
it who knows but he's going to have this

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,659
sense of accomplishment and a sense of

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,459
confidence that brings him to the rest

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,550
of his life and who knows what he'll do

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:48,250
with that so one of my latest kits is a

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,750
music synthesizer kit it's like 30 bucks

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,339
I tried to make it as cheap as possible

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:57,250
and this as an outgrowth of a project

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,959
that I came across when I was in one lab

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,420
in the University of Illinois where I

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,700
went to university that didn't take

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,610
military money the only lab in the

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,680
entire huge University of 40,000 people

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,899
that didn't take military money so we

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,130
were doing cool things like music

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:17,050
synthesizers and electronic electric

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,360
vehicles in fact the person who started

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,390
Tesla Motors was in this lab with me and

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,430
from my friend Martin and no it was not

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,290
someone named Elon it was my friend

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,850
Martin and Elon had the money and he

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,899
stole it but anyways that's another

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,570
story

00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:35,560
in this lab and I had no idea that I

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:37,810
could actually do things in a in

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,620
electronics in a lab at university that

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:43,329
I actually loved so my adviser there

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,399
said you should just do something you

00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:47,860
love and I found music synthesis and I

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,730
made that into my Master's these thesis

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,220
and I actually started loving going to

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,560
digital signal processing class which I

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,110
was loathing before because in digital

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,060
signal processing I could learn what I

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:07,240
needed to make my synthesizer awesome

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:12,640
school can be like that it does not need

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:15,279
to be like this this is test taking this

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,790
is not learning this is the results of

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,420
being trained to take a test is this

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,459
education yes but is a good education

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,290
can we do better

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,180
hell yes we can do way better than this

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,370
we can be much more motivated than

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,060
sitting around having to do this kind of

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,310
stuff project-based learning is

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,740
really really cool school can look like

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,210
this and school is about education is

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,460
about a lifetime of learning that's what

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,610
school should be is preparing all of us

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,770
to live a life of learning a lay a life

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,780
we find fulfilling a life that we find

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,160
meaningful doing things we love and I

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,620
really love that this place is called

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,800
Lifelong Learning Institute and so stem

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,050
comes along and starts taking over but

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,380
this is like huge corporations this is a

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,650
term from the US military because DARPA

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,520
which exists only for the guaranteeing

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,050
this us the superiority of US military

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,060
technology is seeing that education

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,390
isn't good enough for engineers to do

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,690
that for them yeah this is what it's

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,180
about

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,120
and they have tons of money they

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,430
maximize their profits like by

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,890
politicians the US military is six times

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,660
the rest of the world combined is this

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,850
what we want for education or these are

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,910
the people we want to run our education

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:43,550
I don't think so so anyways people have

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:46,550
added at least an A to it for art this

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:50,600
adds at least joy and creativity so that

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,820
it's meaningful and there are many many

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,530
many many many places around the world

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,780
that are taking this into consideration

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,610
this is just one place I was recently

00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,270
out that's been around for about a year

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,070
and a half

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,340
steam head it's a hackerspace for

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:08,510
training teachers how to teach with

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,950
steam and people can do this kind of

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,690
stuff you know there all sorts of

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,800
amazingly cool tools that are out there

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:20,600
like Lego Mindstorm but you know it's

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,540
it's incredibly expensive so why isn't

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,250
there an open-source version of that if

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,410
I had more time I'd be doing that and

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,560
maybe I will there also you know like

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,750
this is just some kid decided he would

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,700
like to teach electronics and he created

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,020
scrappy circuits and for less than a

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,390
dollar a person you can learn

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,900
electronics totally open source of

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,910
course so the more we have of these

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,680
open-source tools so that educators all

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,810
over the world

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,520
make use of them and share them and make

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,190
them better and continue to share that

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,460
around it will help make more

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,560
opportunities for more people and that's

00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:10,660
really what we want and it's up to us to

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:14,430
do that because if we don't do it great

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,430
