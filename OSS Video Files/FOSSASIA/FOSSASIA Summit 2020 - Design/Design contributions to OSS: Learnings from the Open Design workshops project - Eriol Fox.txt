hello everyone over there in Singapore

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,290
for foster Asia I'm so sad that I can't

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:17,250
be there in person I was really looking

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,439
forward to my first fossa event and to

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,109
talk about the projects that I've been

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,439
working on around open design and open

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,720
source design but instead of me being

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,539
there in person because of these unsure

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,690
times I'm here recording what I would be

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:38,120
talking to everyone about for you to

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:42,059
watch afterwards so let's get on with

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,070
the design contributions to open source

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,820
the learnings from the open design

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,309
project ok so a little bit about me my

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,890
name is Errol my pronouns are they then

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,590
there's if you want to tag me in any

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,020
tweets or any content please use my

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,469
pronouns that are the ones that I use

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,769
they/them I am a humanitarian designer

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,110
so I primarily do work in the design

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,970
field around humanitarian and human

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,549
rights cases so for things like election

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,830
monitoring things to do with crisis

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,409
response and things to do within like

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,590
street harassment and these are all tech

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,880
responses to these kinds of humanitarian

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,369
challenges I've been in the mic product

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,100
and digital and web space for about 10

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,950
years now working in design in UX across

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,140
lots of different titles and I've been

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,360
working in like humanitarian and

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,689
nonprofit sector for around seven years

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,570
both voluntarily and professionally so

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,570
both paid and unpaid work and I'm fairly

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,509
new to open-source I'm fairly new to the

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,229
world of openness and open source about

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,799
two years was when I had my first role

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:02,210
in an open-source technology nonprofit

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,579
doing design work for it for their tools

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,129
and when I was working in this open

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,929
source organization there's nonprofit

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,670
one of the things that me and my

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,940
colleague my other design colleague used

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,700
to talk about a lot where

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,519
why there aren't many design really

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,110
related contributions to open source so

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,300
we were there working within the

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,420
open-source day-to-day and we were

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,620
seeing developers and people that could

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,230
code and people that could write

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,970
documentation any anybody really that

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,959
was from a sort of technical background

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,510
or perhaps like a part of the coding

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,970
community or you know that kind of

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,160
techie community they were ready and

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,239
able to be contributing anything that

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,370
they they care to to the repo when they

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,019
when they had the time and us as

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,390
designers we were really curious as to

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,549
why there were design related

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,620
contributions as well because we were

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,750
working openly in issues in those open

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,269
repos as well publishing our design work

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,700
as openly as possible as weak we could

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,590
while still using proprietary tools at

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,170
the time because we weren't really sure

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,380
about what options there were for design

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,430
open source design tooling so yeah we

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,470
were curious why aren't there more

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,910
design contributions we did a couple of

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,100
different projects around this we did

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,290
one with in the open leaders Mozilla

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,630
open leaders program to try and break

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,400
down some of the barriers to design

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,000
contributions or at least investigated

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,410
like very early on we also did that for

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,970
product management and a few of the

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,430
other kind of functions that you find

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,500
around design and tech products in

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,569
general we were basically just really

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,470
confused as to why people that aren't

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:44,829
coders don't get more involved in open

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,109
source as well one of the partnerships

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,000
that we had really early on was with a

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,730
organization called designer they're an

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,680
agency a global agency have many many

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,870
designers all around the world and they

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,569
approached us to do some pro bono work

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,180
so free work for a non-profit and they

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,519
were really interested in us at the time

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,650
the open source organization that I

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,680
worked for was called Ushahidi and they

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,010
made tech products for lots of different

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,510
cases like I said humanitarian cases but

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,609
predominantly the tool that they were

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,489
doing some pro bono work on was a tool

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:20,680
called 10/4 which was looking at how to

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:23,940
solve the communications problems in

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,530
crisises so when you try and get ink on

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,570
with multiple people through multiple

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,580
different methods all at once to try and

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,860
find out whether they're safe and this

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,400
was a real use case for the tool when we

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,260
first created 10 for within the O she D

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,630
open-source nonprofit it was off the

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,910
back of a terrorist attack that happened

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,190
in a mall in Nairobi where some of our

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,510
staff or a present in the mall as the

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,950
attack was happening we couldn't get in

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,100
contact with them so we went through

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,270
this frantic process of trying to get in

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,460
contact with them trying to get in

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,230
contact with their families through just

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,210
you know the regular ways you get you

00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,030
communicate in a crisis you know text

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,290
calling what's up all the different kind

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,070
of methods to try and find out whether

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,070
they're okay

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,670
and we didn't find out if they were okay

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,770
for many many hours and it was very

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,840
frantic and very upsetting at the time

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,820
for the team that was working at the

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,830
time and on the Monday they decided that

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,840
well we create open-source tools so

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,210
let's try and find a way to create a

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,550
tool that helps this process and that

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,310
was the tool called 10-4 I'm the

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,350
organization the agency designer were

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,230
doing some work on this tool they did

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,690
they did some work in just in isolation

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,890
as they do as an agency but then one of

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,040
the things that they suggested that we

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,570
do was a kind of hackathon but for

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,810
designer as they called it a design Jam

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,550
and this was our first event the would

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,470
let it become some of the format for

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,620
open design and the open design work

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:53,300
that we did within ugd on the tool 10/4

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,520
in communities really around the world

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,580
so we did that first event in Berlin in

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,050
2018 it was a really interesting event

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,020
we learned a lot about how to do the

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,580
next one which was in Seattle in 2019

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,320
and the main thing that we learned about

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,120
designers engaging with open source

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,120
tools and contributing to open source

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,610
tools and specifically open source tools

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,150
the aim to do some kind of very obvious

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,860
good in the world it's a very obvious

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,380
nonprofit or humanitarian use case is

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,060
that really designers want to work on

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,940
projects for good it's a real

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,830
fundamental part of the design designer

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,270
brain that we want to solve problems we

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,680
want to solve problems using our skills

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,880
which are design skills

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,220
one of the things that we don't get to

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,280
do is often within commercial corporate

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,930
roles is work on projects that very

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,690
clearly are for the common good of

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:49,479
humanity or the earth or for any kind of

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,370
forged process and it was really a

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,410
simple learning that we discovered at

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,220
first this designers wanting to work on

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,770
projects for good so after those first

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,560
two events we were having conversations

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,020
with Adobe at the time so Adobe if

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
you're you're probably aware of what

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,430
they create they create proprietary or

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,139
commercial tools for designers and

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,120
really there are lots of other design

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,610
tools that you can use now nowadays both

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,520
open-source and still proprietary or

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,840
commercial tools but Adobe is one of the

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,780
most popular ones it's one of the ones

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,699
that we typically first learn to use as

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,889
designers so it's really important that

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,710
Adobe came on board with the with the

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,240
idea of this project really early on and

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,250
they were present at the Berlin event

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,630
and at the Seattle event and they were

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,050
curious how they could progress this

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,400
work you know how they could support

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,699
designers working on projects were good

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,560
with the added benefit of learning

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:47,080
better how designers want to contribute

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,419
and collaborate in an open-source kind

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,099
of way there was some you know things

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,449
that Adobe we're gonna get out of that

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:54,900
kind of engagement they were gonna learn

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,849
better how designers collaborate across

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,889
different time zones and different kind

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,530
of complications and maybe not as part

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,820
of a employed team so they really wanted

00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,310
to find out how they could make things

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,190
better and genuinely how that they could

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,500
surface open-source projects that need

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,960
design help a lot better within their

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,460
tooling so together the three of us oh

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,650
that's Adobe OSHA Headey and designer

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,669
created the project called open design

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:27,580
and we were trying at first to

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,320
investigate in self questions around the

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,270
wine aren't there more designers in open

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:36,190
source and what we what we really wanted

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,890
to do at first was a love in depth

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,010
research so we spent a number of months

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,959
researching how to go forward with the

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,900
with the project and how to you how to

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,480
build on the success or the learnings of

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,699
the first two

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,110
hence so we came up with the with the

00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,060
statement that we kind of wanted to

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,760
wanted to go with witches designers

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,220
still collaborating and contributing to

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,470
specifically at the moment humanitarian

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,639
open source software and tech figured at

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:11,820
challenge gatherings and these this was

00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,160
the the primary focus initially of open

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,449
design to learn and to carry on the

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,649
format and carry on learning from the

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:21,750
format again in an open way but there

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,579
are lots of challenges there are too

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,050
many challenges actually that we really

00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,709
learnt within the process of both our

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:32,180
research and doing the challenge events

00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:35,880
to really go into any depth within

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,490
within a short talk time but I'm gonna

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,110
cover some of the challenges that we

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,290
discovered some of the most important

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,990
ones I think if you are curious as to

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,250
know what all the other challenges were

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,470
then they're all available on our open

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,850
repo which has a link at the end of the

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:56,550
talk so lots of different challenges one

00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:00,110
of the first challenges is really that

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:05,279
most designers don't have a clue what

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:08,339
OSS can be or is so when you speak to

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,339
designers and other kinds of roles that

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,959
aren't necessarily coding or development

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:19,589
roles they can really be perplexed or

00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,240
surprised or just largely unaware of

00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,459
what open source software is maybe

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,620
they've heard of the term maybe they've

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,990
talked to coders or developers before

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,870
and they've heard of it but if they have

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,870
then often their response are you know

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,500
uninstalls

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:44,490
really limited to terminal-based tools

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,279
or very developer heavy tools or things

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,459
that are very complex and code related I

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,069
think she really get very surprised that

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:57,120
there are open source tools which were

00:10:53,069 --> 00:11:00,959
much more you know accessible to a

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,320
designer both for use from designers but

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,990
also

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,860
to be involved in how those those

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,280
develop so that it's not just about

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:15,160
trying to understand the terminal or

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:19,690
very very code heavy things in depth

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:22,600
that they there is a whole world of open

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,000
source to to discover that is very much

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,060
on the kind of for good or humanitarian

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,100
side of things and often what happens

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,810
when you talk about the kinds of

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,250
open-source software that is out there

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:39,490
to to designers like try and break their

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:43,060
misconceptions of what open sources they

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:46,510
then are able to better understand why

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,700
the developer tools for open source

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,340
exists and they then are able to start

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,020
understanding that a lot of these open

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,870
source developer tools and things that

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,600
are created and used predominantly by

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,180
developers are the foundations of the

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,100
open web and how they will also use the

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,710
the open web and then they can better

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,420
start to understand and engage with open

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:12,550
source software as a larger concept the

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,120
second challenge really is a is a pretty

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,950
huge one to be honest it's um the open

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,450
source software isn't really part of

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:24,760
design education or at least not

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:27,130
explicitly so so when you are in formal

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,260
or informal education as a designer a

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:34,630
lot of what gets covered is not at all

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,310
really code related or open source

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,990
related there there even might be

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,380
certain modules within your design

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,900
education again formal or informal they

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,700
actually use open open-source tools or

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,310
that have some kind of open source

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,530
tooling within it but the designers

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,930
really don't get kind of educated or

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,090
told about open source as either a set

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,360
of principles as a movement as a history

00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:01,120
or as a practical kind of application

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,340
that they are likely to be using so it's

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,390
it's absent from my education largely

00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,860
and and it's coming more into

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,400
educational practices now so I know that

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,810
there

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I've worked with a university in West

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,900
Germany in Darmstadt the do modules on

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,910
open source software I'm building on

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,040
open source software and teaching the

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,160
principles of kind of open source

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,460
software nuts like the ethos of how you

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,720
work openly and really that's like one

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,000
of the first times that I've heard an

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,500
educational institution of any kind

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,380
really talking about open source or

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,070
openness and connected to this issue

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,020
around education is another issue which

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,200
I won't go into too much depth about but

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,990
it really is then connected to how

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,600
designers go into employment so if we're

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,820
not teaching open source and

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,690
contribution to open source within our

00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:02,290
educational institutions and we're also

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,270
not educating our hire are hiring

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,690
companies or companies that are looking

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:11,050
for designers then even if we did teach

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,390
open source within design education when

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,000
they go along to the interviews for

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,970
these companies or these organizations

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,740
then the people hiring them are not

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,390
going to be knowledgeable about open

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,490
source either so when they have these

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,650
designers you know come to them with

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,690
these portfolios full of maybe lots of

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,420
great design contributions to open

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,780
source they're not really gonna know how

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,720
to digest that information and regard it

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,390
as highly as it possibly should be so

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,240
what we'd love to be looking at and

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,400
doing is like this synchronized effort

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,750
for education within the industry and

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,340
within the community as a whole

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,160
so not just within design education

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,170
Institute's but within our workplaces

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,530
and within our community as well because

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:02,680
that's how the practices and the ethos

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:05,740
you know scatter throughout the whole of

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,680
their design community and how it

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,590
becomes part of how we operate in

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,120
general and how we how we engage with

00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,700
each other and with a better

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,410
understanding so hand in hand with

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,570
education needs to come our workplaces

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:24,400
as well

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,710
so another problem that we have is even

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,080
if the designer is know about open

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,060
source so maybe they really have an

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,830
in-depth understanding of open source or

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,430
maybe they have worked on open source

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,290
tools like myself or you know are really

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,390
really interested in the process of open

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,370
source and they don't need convincing

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:45,880
then the the fact that a lot of open

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:49,060
source exists within github or get lab

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,730
or places where repositories and

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,440
projects are stored it's a really huge

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,810
barrier for a lot of designers and

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,960
basically people that don't consider

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,990
themselves technical which is really

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,340
really toxic kind of view of things

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,900
that's one of our big problems within

00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,850
the tech industry in general but

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,190
basically whenever you you talk about

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,930
open source and github with a designer

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,090
if they're not comfortable with a

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,240
certain what they consider a certain

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,370
level of code competency they think that

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,400
it's not for them so that's just a place

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,890
a sector of the internet that they just

00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,830
don't feel included and they just don't

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:35,050
feel like they have access to that and

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,780
often this is because a lot of the open

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:41,650
source software projects really do

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,480
require you to have a very basic level

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,490
of knowledge of like how to even

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,920
navigate the interface on github how do

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,290
I even find where issues are if I've

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,540
never been shown before let alone try

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,910
and clone a repo and then you know

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,400
create a local instance of open source

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,700
software to you know contribute to maybe

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,770
a UI improvement or some kind of UX

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,730
improvement that's not even going

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:08,290
anywhere near actually you know you know

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:14,520
cloning and and creating like an

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:18,189
instance of the open source tool um and

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,050
yeah so github is just really really

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,870
tricky space because it's where a lot of

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,839
things happen it's a great place and the

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:28,060
light works really really well for some

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,370
of these existing functions but for

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,280
designers it's really really a barrier

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:37,600
it's really really tricky

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,370
um and really can often only be

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,090
successful if you have somebody that

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,590
knows the the open-source repo really

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,430
really well working alongside you to

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:51,700
help you set up an instance Kate sue

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:54,820
another another problem for designers

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,170
within open source is on the other side

00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,180
of things so from the open source

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,450
software side of things and when you

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,430
talk to them about design and often when

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,440
you say the word design to them they

00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,230
often immediately think of logos and

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,960
graphics or basically user interface or

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:14,650
visuals so anything that you can see

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:19,000
essentially and this really you know

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:21,490
removes a whole huge section of really

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,760
valuable design practice like user

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:28,690
experience and usability and interaction

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,240
design and research lead design and

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,030
design thinking and discovery pieces and

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,100
all the all the stuff there is less

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:40,060
about the visuals and less about the

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,070
implementation of those actual sort of

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,630
interfaces or products and actually

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,150
really about how you design an

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:50,530
experience that's right for the people

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:53,290
that are using them and this is actually

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:57,850
a kind of really tricky problem because

00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:00,700
a lot of this can be attributed to a

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,570
problem around say jargon or really

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,700
specific functional language so even

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,890
when I was describing some of the design

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,160
functions then some of those you might

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,600
have been familiar with others you might

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,680
not have been familiar with in that

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:22,630
process of when we hear technical jargon

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,840
for a function or a job that isn't our

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,880
own we can get quite you know closed off

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,340
and scared when somebody starts you know

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,040
really sort of talking about their of

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,830
jargon language and so what we really

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,810
need to do as designers and as open

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,640
source projects within this problem is

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,800
start having bigger and better and more

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,320
inclusive conversations about what

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,810
design can offer an open-source project

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,550
beyond

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,490
like logos and graphics but be really

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:53,070
sympathetic and inclusive when people

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,170
within open-source projects do

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,270
understand designers logos and graphics

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,230
and really help them along with with how

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:03,060
much more design can can offer open

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,550
source projects beyond beyond those

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,320
those things but also those are also

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,060
very important things that are great

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,440
contributions as well logos and graphics

00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:17,400
are very important too so open source

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,070
issues within a typical repo can also be

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,040
a problem they can be really restrictive

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:25,380
so I think most of the audience at

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,690
fossae sure will be familiar with issues

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,510
or tickets or how we describe pieces of

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,210
works pieces of work within repositories

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,880
on our on our open source software but

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:41,310
they are often really solutions focused

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,990
technically wise they use again like I

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,210
was saying about design jargon they use

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:49,230
a lot of technical jargon or code jargon

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,530
and a lot of these issues are really

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,360
just not accessible to designers so even

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:57,720
if they might want to help on a specific

00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,940
part of the open source software they

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,620
might really even not know how to read

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,960
some of the issues that actually are

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,960
part of you know that section that they

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,580
want to work on and what we can do for

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,380
this is is make our issues a lot more

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,860
friendly a lot more information on a lot

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,660
more open to other kinds of ways of

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,690
explaining what is needed in that issue

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,820
so that if it's a technical issue its

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,430
solving a technical problem then you can

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,190
explain it in in less technical terms

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,140
maybe or in a really simple terms and if

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,540
somebody that isn't a coder stumbles

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,920
across that issue or if you think the

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,390
design might be able to actually help

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,050
that issue and you take it as a label

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,460
then with a design label then the

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,750
designer could come along and read that

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,980
issue and actually say hey I think that

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,840
there's a way that we can improvement

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,310
that from a different perspective and

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,490
that way you can actually grow your

00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:52,170
open-source project in new and kind of

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,799
unknown ways by being much more

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,820
inclusive in how you write your issues

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,720
but alongside restrictive issue

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,549
descriptions that are typically found

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:08,000
within most open source issues within

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:13,190
the repositories when you take these

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,049
issues to or when you take generalised

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,660
problems around a piece of software to

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:21,330
workshops design workshops and you say

00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,630
hey we want to improve this part of this

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:28,260
product this feature they then become

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:31,080
unfocused and the design responses to

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,480
those problems like relevancy so what

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,980
will be created there by the designers

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,909
and this is what we experienced in the

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,830
first two design events that we had was

00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:44,309
designers came up with these great sort

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:46,130
of responses to solve those problems but

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:49,380
none of them were anywhere near

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:52,260
implementable by the even a full-time

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,620
like huge tech team let alone an open

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,830
source contributions tech team so what

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,630
you really need to do with issues that

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,450
you or features that you want to take to

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,850
a design community or to designers for

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,419
open source design contributions it's

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,159
find that middle ground between a

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:16,440
restrictive technical sounding issue and

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:18,929
an open explorative design issue that

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,520
still has the relevancy to that

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:22,470
implementation so you have to find a

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,760
really good middle ground between these

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:30,030
two two places a huge problem that

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,570
designers have is lack of version

00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:36,299
control in both our software that we use

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:39,360
proprietary or a lot of open source

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:41,429
tools don't have this just yet there are

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,190
some things that are happening which is

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:47,880
really exciting but our software and our

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,820
processes are very removed from the idea

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,669
of version control

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:57,929
so within coding there is this whole you

00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:59,909
know way of branching code and conflicts

00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,210
when you try and merge and there's this

00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:04,530
process of communication that is really

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,960
reasonably well established within the

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,570
code community but within the design

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,730
community we don't really have

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,440
you know the technical ways of doing

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,380
these things and a lot of it has to

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,370
happen through communication and through

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,980
almost our way of pair para designing so

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,679
that we're not basically two designers

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,320
working on the same issue and in

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,290
conflict or that we're also sharing our

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,020
resources really really openly and

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,270
collaboratively as well so we have a

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,910
huge problem around version control

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,400
conflict and processes for designers to

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,010
participate in open-source and one of

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,630
the best things that could happen is in

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,010
the future is seeing this not only

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,600
within the tools that we use as

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,710
designers both proprietary and open

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,169
source but within the systems where open

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,179
source software is housed so the the get

00:24:54,169 --> 00:25:00,380
hubs and the get labs and the places

00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:02,809
where the projects exist as well so to

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,270
move on from the many many challenges

00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:08,630
that we try to solve at least in some

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,850
way with our next few events that we did

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,730
for the open design project I'm gonna go

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:19,820
on to what we did for the open design

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:21,440
events so we did we did a lot of

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:26,929
research we did a lot of investigation

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:30,320
we created a comprehensive set of tools

00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:32,120
and methodology and framework and

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,830
approaches that were based on really

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,140
robust research with people that have

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,970
done similar things before so we

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,130
partnered really really closely with a

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,490
lot of organizations that have looked at

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,559
things like this before or done similar

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,870
activities to this before so you're

00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,630
talking about your open ideas you're

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,210
talking about your global virtual design

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,690
sprints you're talking your open source

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:59,390
design community and things like The

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,030
Hague hacks which is again another

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,640
design event that's focused around a

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,890
humanitarian cases so we worked really

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,910
closely with these with these people

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,429
that have done some of these things

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,559
before to say hey how can we how can we

00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,590
make some progress within this on our

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:19,650
events and we created a framework and

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:22,850
then we did two two events we did one in

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,770
Bangalore in India for the design up

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,700
festival the designer conference there

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:32,700
and we did one in Taipei in Taiwan for

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,950
the open up global summit there and we

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,360
focused on the tool within Asia HEDIS

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,710
open-source tool base which was ten for

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,800
the one that I mentioned earlier wrong

00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,870
which was crisis communication and we

00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,430
focused on very local events that had

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,170
happened in those countries that were

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,510
very relevant to the people there that

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,700
were coming to these events so in

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,380
Bangalore we focused on the floods that

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,860
had happened in the southwest of the

00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:02,300
country in the Kerala region and in

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:05,900
Taipei in Taiwan we focused on the

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:09,330
effects of typhoons and hurricanes

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,850
around rural farming communities and the

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,950
loss of livelihoods there so we wanted

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,400
to make them really specific and really

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:19,380
relevant to the locations as well as

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,130
bringing the processes that we'd created

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,950
as well so what we did at these events

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:30,390
is we did a series of different design

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:32,700
activities so these are what we chose as

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:36,270
initial activities to do over a full-day

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,900
workshop and they are empathy mapping

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,180
within our user base for our tool 10/4

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,660
and for our use cases of floods and

00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,310
typhoons we did a exercise which was

00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,500
called to find the problems which helps

00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:53,070
you really identify the problems that

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,980
are part of the issues that you're

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:59,550
trying to solve in the open source way

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:02,030
we did ideation around the defined

00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,710
problems that came from that activity

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,510
there was a storyboarding exercise to

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,920
try and fill in any gaps and see if

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,090
there were any things that we'd missed

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,460
when we were thinking about our

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,700
solutions and then we looked at

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,130
sketching and prototyping within the the

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,010
workshop as well as an output as our

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:23,400
final contribution to the open source

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:28,380
and I think one of the one of the main

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,360
things to talk about here is the pre pre

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,250
work that went into these these

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,220
workshops so

00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,080
when we were constructing these these

00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,150
workshops there were a series of

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,760
different things that we created as a

00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,130
team as the open design team in order to

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,030
make these workshops go a lot smoother

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:51,210
and one of them was the process of

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,220
taking a restrictive issue and an open

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,900
design challenge and finding that middle

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,400
ground and we tried two different

00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:02,880
approaches we tried a more restrictive

00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,830
less open approach in Bangalore and in

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,050
Taipei we tried a much more open

00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,210
approach but still some restrictions and

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,860
we think that we found pretty much the

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,110
middle ground between testing those

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,060
those two different extremes we've now

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:19,380
found after these two events that kind

00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:22,380
of the sweet area for where you would

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,720
find like describe a challenge for a set

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,280
of designers that would still be able to

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,580
be implemented by a technical team in an

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,860
open-source repo and one of the great

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,620
things about the events that we held is

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,930
that they were for designers largely but

00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,720
they weren't isolated just two designers

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,750
so within Bangalore we had developers we

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,270
had product managers we had different

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,100
kinds of designers of all types all

00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,390
different kinds of functions all

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,850
different kinds of backgrounds

00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:58,500
participating and in tayo Taiwan in

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:02,280
Taipei and I when we also had people

00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,380
that were you know from every section of

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,050
the design community so people that were

00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,450
still studying and people that were you

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,040
know been part of the design industry

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,780
for a number of years and worked on

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,490
different kinds of tools in different

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:21,540
kinds of cases as well and one of the

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,880
really big learnings from the events

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,340
that we did and the way that we'd be

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,600
taking the open design project further

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,250
is the first one is around the locations

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,590
specific nurse and how it builds

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:39,540
community so because design in

00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,420
open-source it's relatively new and our

00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,920
processes and communities they're not

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:46,160
structured or socialized in the same way

00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,919
as developer communities we really need

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,720
the design workshops for open source to

00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,000
be really location specific in the

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,130
beginning so this might not be the case

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,429
much further in the future we might be

00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,770
able to do much more like remote less

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:04,610
location specifically things in the

00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:06,559
future but right now as the this as this

00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,270
initiative and as designers are then

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,919
open source is growing we really do need

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,620
it to be location specific for the

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,299
people that are new to open source the

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,460
designers that are new to open source it

00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,929
really needs to make sense to them and

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,490
there really needs to be that community

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:23,059
building alongside the practical

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:27,260
elements of contributing so this means

00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:30,650
the the the that the location should

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:34,220
ideally be somewhere where the open

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:37,730
source is used so when we were choosing

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:41,720
where to go with the open source open

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,850
design workshops we were choosing places

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,309
like Bangalore and Taipei where there

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,020
was a real use case for 10 for the open

00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,809
source tool that we were contributing

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,970
design 202 and we were lucky that 10 4

00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:55,789
in a sense is very global has a very

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,710
global use and crisis's are kind of you

00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,330
know Universal everywhere especially at

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:03,260
the moment we've got a global crisis

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:06,830
happening at the moment so a lot of we

00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:10,580
were a lot of benefit was from a tool

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,350
that was very global in nature but if

00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,710
you have a tool an open-source tool that

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,299
is much more specific to a certain

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,960
region a certain location a certain

00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:22,640
group of people in a sense like if it's

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,740
specifically for people from Nigeria

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,500
they are interacting with the Nigerian

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,929
government perhaps like open data around

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,340
the government use then it would very

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,260
much make sense to hold it in that

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,210
location at the very least in the

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,120
beginning to grow that community and to

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:40,370
really strengthen the community and and

00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,370
this really there's a second benefit to

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:46,370
to this and it allows designers to to

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:48,559
really understand what's involved in

00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:50,090
building a team around open source and

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,940
how to communicate with an open source

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,110
and the process of discussion and

00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,570
collaboration and share

00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,520
that is inherent within open-source

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,730
software and the kind of coding

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:07,020
community that we're again beginning to

00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:08,310
explore as designers so this is really

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,920
really important

00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:14,070
location-wise eventually we'll be able

00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,750
to move to more remote and processes I

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,360
think but at the moment it does really

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,510
matter about making things location

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,660
specific and in type a we trialed

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,520
actually doing a different format so in

00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,340
Bangalore we did a full one day workshop

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,040
where we did about six or seven hours

00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:36,120
non-stop that except for with breaks for

00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:38,070
lunch and coffee and they did that whole

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,560
workshop within a day and in Taipei we

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:44,460
split it into two two workshops so we

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:48,030
did four hours on a Saturday within the

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,880
conference we did a remote week of

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,400
activities where the teams could self

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,500
organize remotely and they were given

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,330
tasks that they could do each day that

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,730
typically would take around anything

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,370
from about half an hour to an hour of

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:04,050
somebody's day depending on how they

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,210
split up the different work and when

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,610
they wanted to do different pieces of

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,530
work and then we did the the last four

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,020
hours on the following Saturday so we

00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,550
had a week sprint in the middle and that

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,680
worked really really well in a lot of

00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,200
ways but again we were trying things out

00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,960
and seeing what what worked well for for

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,670
the design community we're trying out a

00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,220
lot of new things within these processes

00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:29,670
so there's a format for that as well

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,590
there's again open on our repo so first

00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:33,480
learning from the open design workshops

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,180
was location specific and building

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,890
community very important the second

00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,980
thing is a little bit more specific to

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:45,020
the actual workshops that you that you

00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:49,500
do so inviting what we called a witness

00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:52,460
to the to the event this is absolutely

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,230
essential it's absolutely critical I

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,050
actually would not have gone through

00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:01,200
with any any of the events if I was

00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:04,440
unable to get witnesses for the events

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,780
and what a witness's is sometimes you

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,670
might hear them called users or they

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,860
you might hear them kind of cooled like

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:17,030
yeah users or personas it's basically

00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:20,190
people that are the user software

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:23,460
basically in a lot of ways but it's so

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:25,550
much more important within the use case

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,840
that we were doing which was crisis

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,180
around our tool ten-four

00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,230
it was much more critical to call them

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,090
something different to call them

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,850
something more sympathetic call them

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,160
witnesses because they were there and

00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,470
they witnessed the crisis and they were

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,260
affected by the crisis it humanizes

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:46,260
their participation and it legitimizes

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,410
their participation in a way that often

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,550
isn't afforded to the kind of Nate label

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:55,410
of user in a way so they were critically

00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:59,370
important to the workshops that we did

00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:01,890
and so we had in the Bangalore workshop

00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:05,730
we had a person called akela come along

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:08,700
and she had done a lot of work within an

00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:11,760
NGO with the populations in Kerala and

00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:15,090
produced a really comprehensive report

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,210
on on the the process of the flood and

00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:22,290
what happened and who was affected by em

00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:25,710
and in and in Taiwan we had two people

00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:30,750
from an organization well one one rural

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:35,130
farmer that actually sadly had his farm

00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:36,690
devastated by a typhoon and a person who

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,650
helped to organize the volunteer

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:43,560
response to not only the farmer but

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:47,010
other rural farmers in the area and then

00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,840
organizer a community group or an NGO

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,760
afterwards I can share I can share the

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,740
links for the places that these

00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,390
witnesses worked and the places the the

00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,880
information of how to to find out more

00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:59,550
about them but they were involved in the

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,000
whole process so there was briefings for

00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,950
them prior to the event so why we wanted

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,960
to involvement and involve them and how

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,450
how we wanted to involve them and and

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,910
how we valued them and also they were

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,770
there throughout the whole event on as

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,339
the designers were working on the issues

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:19,430
or on the challenges they gave a

00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:22,469
very minute or an hour long talk about

00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:25,559
how they how they experience the

00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:27,329
problems that the designers we're gonna

00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,400
be solving within the open source

00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,289
software so they they have the chance to

00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,150
really speak from their own experience

00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:36,329
because that's vitally important within

00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:39,180
designing better experiences for not

00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,979
only like you know commercial tools but

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,349
also open source tools and they were

00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:45,960
also there too so the designer is within

00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:47,130
groups could ask them questions at any

00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,749
points if they weren't quite sure

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,819
whether they were on the right track

00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:52,680
with what they were designing they could

00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:55,440
validate their assumptions and they

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:59,099
could validate their direction with the

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,019
with the witnesses and they also were

00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,900
there when the designers would present

00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:05,700
their prototypes at the end so they

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,160
would give it you know show what they'd

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,200
created within that day for their open

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,789
source design contribution and they were

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,680
able to have that feedback with the

00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,059
witnesses and say the witness was would

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,130
be able to say hey this wouldn't quite

00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,079
work in this situation for these reasons

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,119
and that really is the direct feedback

00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,799
that designers need to iterate on the

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,200
things that they're doing so they're

00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:27,809
actually not only creating open source

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,719
design contributions but the best kind

00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:33,420
of open source design contributions for

00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,269
the use case that they're designing for

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,119
so what we're really trying to do is not

00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:41,039
just have you know a design contribution

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,099
that's created in isolation but that

00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:47,130
it's created in this really user centric

00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:51,180
witness centric and really specific to

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:53,450
the tool kind of way so that's why it's

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,660
vitally important to include witnesses

00:38:53,450 --> 00:39:00,119
and slightly connected note as well it's

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,549
also vitally important that you pay your

00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,380
witnesses it's hugely important that a

00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:08,339
lot of these people are taking time of

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,289
their own lives and their days to be

00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:13,410
there and participate in this process so

00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:16,469
we made sure that we paid our witnesses

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:18,119
their time or if they didn't want to be

00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:20,609
paid themselves we made donations to

00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,339
their NGOs or their the community groups

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:26,460
that they were organizing and the link

00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:28,170
there on the screen at the moment is the

00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,080
brief that we sent to witnesses and the

00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,720
information about how we decided

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,880
how we explored the idea of witnesses

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:41,240
within open design so the last challenge

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,880
the last sorry the last finding from the

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,960
open design workshops that we did was

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,170
something that I've talked a little bit

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,630
about already so translating issues into

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,030
design challenges and there's an example

00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:56,630
here on the screen within the ten for

00:39:53,030 --> 00:40:00,890
the open ten for repo for on the OSHA

00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:04,040
Headey account this is an example of an

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:07,130
issue that we took from sort of very

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:10,550
technical issue language through to a

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:13,100
design challenge language and this was

00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:16,460
one of the ones that we took through to

00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,890
the workshop in Thai way type Taipei in

00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,450
Taiwan and this is one of the ones that

00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,720
worked really really well and it's

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:28,220
sectioned in different ways and it

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:31,550
really is carefully constructed in that

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:33,440
it has a has a section for describing

00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,240
the challenge it has a section for

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,600
describing the people that are going to

00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,610
use that function that feature or the

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,340
people that you need to design for it

00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:45,380
also has a section around constraints so

00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,050
things that need to be need to be in

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,850
place for you to be able to design so

00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,620
this actually this is the bit that makes

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,990
the implementation a lot easier so the

00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,160
designers understand the limitations or

00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:58,820
the restrictions that they're working

00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,650
with ie the example is that you know a

00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,260
lot of the the challenges that we were

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,910
working on they had to assume that the

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,680
people that they were designing for were

00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,020
already part of the systems they'd

00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,330
already been added on to the 10/4 system

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:16,850
in some way shape or form to solve that

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:19,040
challenge so we took these these

00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:21,530
restrictive issues or these issues that

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,930
were very technical and we translated

00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,610
them into the design challenges we still

00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,220
have some work to do on this really

00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:32,810
because what you can find within the

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,820
design challenges is even when they are

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,890
created collaboratively with your

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,020
technical teams or with people that are

00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,450
going to implement things it's really

00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,299
hard to not want to describe the

00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,999
solution

00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:46,559
that you want or to describe the thing

00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:49,319
that you know that you can implement and

00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,869
it's really a tricky place to be because

00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:53,609
what you you want to know within any

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,559
kind of software that you cannot can

00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:57,869
implement the solution but what you

00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,880
really want to do by engaging designers

00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:04,170
within this is understand whether

00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:08,699
there's actually a more like valid or a

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:10,229
more beneficial solution that you

00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:11,939
haven't discovered yet

00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:15,359
so you really want to allow for that

00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:17,429
designed discovery and that is not

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,509
prescriptive so that you could

00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:23,039
potentially discover a really like

00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:25,499
groundbreaking new way of solving a key

00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,150
problem that your users your the people

00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:29,459
that are using your open-source might

00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,829
have and you can do that by engaging

00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:35,219
these designers and balancing really

00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:39,449
carefully between restrictive nurse and

00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:43,799
and open open to design thinking and

00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:46,289
design interpretation so to move them on

00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:48,390
to the outputs that you get as actual

00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:50,609
design contributions so we didn't really

00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,079
want to restrict people too much as to

00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,059
what their design contribution would be

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,229
but we did suggest that one of the best

00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:59,160
things they could do is offer a

00:42:55,229 --> 00:43:01,799
prototype and to be able to offer these

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:05,519
prototypes we internally as the open

00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:08,009
design team created a template file

00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:12,689
where of ten for the open source

00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:14,579
software so we had a Adobe XD file Adobe

00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:17,609
XD as a prototyping tools that adobe

00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:20,519
create and it's the tool that we use

00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:22,349
internally in issue Headey on on all of

00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,259
our tools so it was the tool that made

00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:27,660
sense to use so we created this template

00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:31,979
so it basically had every single screen

00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:34,019
within the tool within the live open

00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:35,910
source tool and it also had a design

00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:37,890
what we call a Design Systems all the

00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,929
different elements within that tool and

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,939
we created that and we made it available

00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:44,400
to the designers to explore and to use

00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:48,959
and to pull pieces out to redesign

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,449
certain pieces of the of the UI of the

00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:53,489
visuals and it gave them like a starting

00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:54,230
point because one of the hardest things

00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:57,440
to

00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,060
do with design contributions not really

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,880
having a starting point and also not

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,430
really knowing exactly what the system

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:08,410
the open-source software system actually

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:11,270
looks like and how it operates and if

00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:14,540
how it operates it the barrier is that

00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:17,119
you know you need to do this cloning of

00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,130
a repo and creating a local instance you

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,350
know what this does is it bypasses that

00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,270
process of needing to do that and it

00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,950
actually allows the designers to see oh

00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,840
well this is how its set up at the

00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,460
moment and we can solve this design

00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:33,140
challenge within our groups and

00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:35,540
contribute this design open-source in an

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,040
open-source way by using these certain

00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,330
elements and we can really clearly see

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:44,270
how its structured so the designers

00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:46,340
would you know create a prototype often

00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:48,290
the prototypes didn't have to be a

00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,960
certain way they didn't have to be you

00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,550
know this many pages this many functions

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,890
they didn't have to look a certain way

00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,230
or anything like that it was really to

00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:00,619
see what happened and what we could

00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:04,609
create within teams after you know one

00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:08,780
workshop and what was feasible within

00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:13,609
that and also to to add to the the kind

00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:15,740
of sort of limited timing of a prototype

00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:19,430
it was actually great to give them a

00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,290
stopping point as well because um then

00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,600
the witnesses could give them feedback

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,940
on on what they'd already created and

00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,070
they could actually change things for

00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,950
the next iteration of the open source

00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:32,060
design contribution so prototypes are

00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,770
really really useful but we also got

00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:37,070
other contributions in other ways so

00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,560
documentation sketches we got the

00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,780
empathy Maps like put empathy maps that

00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,690
were created for the different users

00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,609
both digital and physical ones so

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,770
physical ones with post-its and paper

00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:51,859
and digital ones we used a tool called

00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,030
mural which I can share and we created a

00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:54,320
lot of different templates that they

00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,380
could use especially when they were

00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,119
doing a remote sprint so there were lots

00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,500
of different things that ended up as

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,090
contributions lots of different

00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,330
artifacts lots a different insight

00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,590
research

00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:08,790
understanding that ended up as open

00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:12,070
source contributions to to this project

00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,840
and to now kind of move just a little

00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:16,390
bit into the future so those are a lot

00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,430
of what happens within the within the

00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,920
open design the first phase of open

00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:25,030
design essentially so this was about six

00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,700
months of doing all the different kind

00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:29,530
of end to end open design work so right

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,200
through from starting the project and

00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:33,970
setting up all of our comms and outreach

00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,990
and starting to for me formulate all of

00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,640
the different things that we wanted to

00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:40,660
deliver right through to finishing our

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,810
last event this was what we this is what

00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,220
we did within that time period and I've

00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,290
not actually mentioned it yet but it was

00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:53,020
actually funded by Adobe so Adobe have a

00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:55,870
fund which is called Adobe fund for

00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:59,050
design and we received funding enough

00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:01,840
for a very small team of people to

00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:06,310
deliver this over the course of around

00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,780
six ish months in 2019 so the future of

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,100
open design I think is really really

00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,810
bright and it's really really fantastic

00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,300
that we were able to do this project

00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:15,600
through the support of Adobe and really

00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:18,180
what we're looking at continuing is

00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:22,780
increasing and sustaining contribution

00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:25,570
to tools like OSHA HEDIS 10-4 but also

00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:29,440
to other open source projects as well so

00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:31,720
taking what succeeded within the open

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,790
design project on Shaheed is open source

00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,010
tools and really making making it known

00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,870
that you can use that for all the other

00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:41,560
open source tools that you might want to

00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:43,360
use it for supporting a community of

00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,100
collaborative and peer led designers

00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,290
learning new skills and working together

00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,840
and mentoring each other we do that

00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,340
alongside the open source design net

00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,040
community who have been doing this work

00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,260
for around five or six years now we

00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,180
really want to do more building of

00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,910
Understanding between design and open

00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,770
source and we want to help open source

00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,140
projects better understand design and

00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:07,570
the design community better understand

00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:11,770
open source and we need to do that at

00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:13,840
the same time and as synchronously as we

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,330
can so what we really want to do is

00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,390
build

00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:20,030
understanding in a really compassionate

00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:22,910
way so that nobody feels like you know

00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,320
one one function or one sector is taking

00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,510
advantage of the other and that we all

00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,050
understand each other's aims and goals

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:32,030
with open source design and then yeah

00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,160
bringing open design to education and

00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:37,190
workplaces so this goes alongside the

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,710
understanding within the community it's

00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:42,140
about you know getting into those

00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,670
educational practices educational

00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:47,300
institutions and getting into those

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:49,730
workplaces and making open-source and

00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:54,130
design contribution you know a part of a

00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,130
designer's experience as a designer and

00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,780
likewise with developers and with open

00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:04,100
source projects making understanding

00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:07,790
design and working with designers a part

00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:10,820
of their process to do so really what

00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:13,310
what we want to do by kind of being

00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,590
virtually across Asia is we want to

00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:17,150
build more relationships with with open

00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,770
source projects and start to understand

00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:21,770
how we can deliver these kinds of

00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:23,990
workshops for more open source projects

00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:27,860
and build communities around these with

00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:29,690
with designers and we want to build the

00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,060
same relationships with designers and

00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:34,730
developers globally because when you

00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:37,130
isolate this kind of experience this

00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:41,500
kind of project to one place in the

00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:43,520
world is where a huge failing can occur

00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,690
especially when you've got open source

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,390
which is used across borders so lots of

00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,020
open source tools are you know

00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,280
multifunctional for lots of different

00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,010
kinds of people in lots of different

00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,940
countries and it would be absolutely

00:49:55,010 --> 00:50:02,500
foolish of us for to not want to grow

00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:05,450
the community and engage with people

00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,850
everywhere and not not just in the

00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,250
places that are convenient for people

00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:12,140
leading these kinds of projects and

00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,880
initiatives it's really a global

00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:20,420
initiative it's a global need as well to

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:25,010
to participate with with everyone in

00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:26,360
this process so you can find the open

00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:30,290
design

00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:35,210
like open like stuff on this link here

00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:36,950
the github /g GD / open design so it's

00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,660
got the methodology there it's got all

00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,790
the frameworks that we use to create the

00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,830
workshops it's got the processes it's

00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,720
got a lot of our learnings a lot of

00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,850
writing and articles and a lot of our

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,650
positions on certain things it's got a

00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,180
whole lot of interviews that we did and

00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:53,090
all the research that we did before we

00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,830
conducted the workshops as well so if

00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,050
you want to contribute to any of the

00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:59,210
things within the open design project as

00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:02,000
well it's fully open and you can you

00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,650
know do a pull request for any of these

00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,990
pieces of information and you can you

00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,630
can fork that repository and you know

00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:11,840
modify it however you see however you

00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:14,060
see fit and and use it use it widely use

00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,120
it you know energetically and use it in

00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:20,630
the ways that you think are best and

00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:23,390
lastly if I can leave you with the link

00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,710
for the community of designers with an

00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,630
open source which is the open source

00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,510
design net community

00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:32,480
so this is where designers that I have

00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:34,760
had an interest in open source collect

00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,770
and congregate and communicate for many

00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,200
many years now and I'm part of the core

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:42,110
team there I lead some of the meetings

00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,630
and I do some of the sort of welcoming

00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,120
new people there and coordination that

00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:50,630
there is a whole load of amazing people

00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:53,570
that also coordinate and lead this group

00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:56,000
so you can find a lot of those core

00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:58,010
members within the forum that's on the

00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,110
web site and you can also find a section

00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:02,180
on that website where maybe if you're

00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:04,730
not quite sure what your first design

00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:07,190
issues should be or how to engage with

00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,980
designers you can add a you can add a

00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,500
post on our at the forum the discourse

00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,380
forum on this website and asking for

00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:18,440
support so you know anything from oh we

00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:21,170
actually know that we need a logo or a

00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,210
set of buttons or we need some UX help

00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,780
when we need some you know user

00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:28,370
interviews for for our open source tools

00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,590
and we'd love a designer to help us with

00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,240
those right through to we actually not

00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,680
really sure how we can improve this tool

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,300
but does the designer want to take a

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,690
look or does a designer want to have a

00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,560
synchronous pairing session where one of

00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,480
the devil

00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,250
maintainer of an open-source text and

00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,090
through the tool and they can you know

00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:49,190
do some feedback there's also some great

00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:53,360
first design issues that I can suggest

00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:56,180
and I have Twitter thread on so again if

00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,100
you want to know what some just good

00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:01,280
first design issues that you can create

00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:03,770
are that are very exploratory very sort

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,990
of test out the waters of designing

00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:08,720
engagement then please find me on

00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:11,000
Twitter you can find my Twitter handle

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,750
on the bottom left hand of the screen

00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:19,130
there at Aroldis design and you can find

00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:21,860
the open source design team open SRC

00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:25,940
design on twitter as well so i'd like to

00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:28,430
thank the force asia folks for screening

00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,590

interesting and informative if you want

00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:36,380
to talk more about open source design

00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,600
open design any of the things that i've

00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,870
talked about throughout this talk then

00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,670
