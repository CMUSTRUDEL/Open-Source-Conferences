Today, in most cases, IoT and AI work together in the cloud. Data from IoT devices is transmitted back to a central hub in the cloud where it is analyzed and stored and actionable insights are sent back to the device. In this talk, I will discuss some real-life use-cases of performing AI on edge and its importance; followed by the challenges of the presently used approaches in terms of latency, network connectivity, privacy, cost, etc and its possible solutions.
