and so my name is Georg I tell you about

00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,850
trouble which is tragic about web

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,529
shortcuts that are social income of

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,320
privacy next slide please so this is the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,420
main stream we can type in things like

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,460
yeah whitey kitten next slide and it

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,920
brings us to the YouTube results page

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,070
for kittens the next slide we can type

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,779
in GF our sin comma Kol next slide and

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,580
it takes us to the Google flight search

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,550
for flights from Singapore to Paulo

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,560
Lumpur next slide we can type in Fr 3

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,519
which is French dictionary next slide it

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,740
takes us to the French English

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,870
Dictionary about the translation for

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,030
tree next slide so as you see it's a

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,820
project similar to the DuckDuckGo banks

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,649
or the Yap NAB service or a search she'd

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,180
or find find it and also the browser has

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,770
sometimes inside the search of

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,809
functionality next slide what is

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,550
different so difference is that we have

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,739
multiple arguments right we can type in

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,750
something like j-f else in comma kon or

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,760
even three arguments like the second

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,730
example would search for fights on March

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,620
24th or we can even like this these

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,600
arguments can be typed so we can also

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,960
instead of a date we can type an mo and

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,299
it will map to the next Monday like

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,530
slide another difference is to have

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,330
French dictionaries so we have

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,830
namespaces and variables now the problem

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,360
is when we search for dictionary do we

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,159
want to French English or French German

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,530
or French polish depends on language we

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,390
speak right so this is why in trouble we

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,040
have namespaces so the same shortcut can

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,840
be used in different namespaces I as a

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,820
user can subscribe to a namespace and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,320
then I get the shortcuts for my language

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,720
and for my country and there are even

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,990
also namespaces for my for every user

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,180
next slide the most biggest difference

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,799
trader is privacy trouble comes to full

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,509
privacy because all the processing is

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,670
done within the client so no search

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,700
curve is sent to the trouble server next

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,829
slide so let's look at how this happens

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,009
behind the scenes we have a user typed

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:52,079
in that Titan GAF elk Si and comma Kol

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:54,090
next slide it will it gets parsed into

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,979
keywords EFL and the arguments as a and

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,229
cool so from that follows we have two

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,500
arguments next slide then a fetch is

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,210
made to this URL on github in the troppo

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,450
data repository we look at it we have a

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,190
file / DF l / - yamo and next slide if

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,539
we have such a file has yellow data the

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,280
most important line is the first one

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,680
that your

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,080
next slide so we see this is the your

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,640
airline with placeholders and we have a

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,590
front placeholder of two placeholder

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,990
with some also transformation happening

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,420
next slide so this is translated into Si

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,520
and Kol uppercase next slide and the

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,350
users taken to their results page next

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,950
slide so of course it's a bit more

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,360
complex

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,250
we have namespaces with different

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
fetches more fetches I don't know then

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,000
only one and we have also personal

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,350
shortcuts so your github repo can be a

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,239
name since then you can subscribe to

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,400
other people's rent namespaces next

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,440
slide so this is the code structure you

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
have a github organization slash trouble

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,560
and there's trouble data that only

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,050
contains the data only the ML files with

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,269
the web interface and trouble meters -

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,140
web and there's a template trouble data

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,730
user that you can fork and then create

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,890
shortcuts within your repo as I said and

00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,720
also it has a conflict ml file so you

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,670
can adjust it to your needs so as you

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,170
see it's all decoupled this is why it's

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,150
not just the project where you're like I

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,340
dropped some export data that you can

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,600
use some API no it's the ecosystem like

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,730
it's it's for multiple usage design

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,040
first next slide so how can you

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,720
contribute you can add some data now

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,100
it's much Germany focus because I'm from

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,150
Germany so you can add shortcuts for

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,590
your language for your country

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,660
dictionaries are missing

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,060
you can also add shortcuts to document

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,489
or documentation about your favorite

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,709
chromic programming api and so on next

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,120
slide we can also help to improve the

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,489
front-end so right now it's made a

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,049
booster for and pure JavaScript so there

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,500
can be there's multiple options to make

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,239
it you are a react and so on next slide

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,070
and you can also create new front-end so

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,170
you only need to interact with data it's

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,269
all Yammer files it is get its own gate

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,400
so you can pull it regularly we can set

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,600
up a wrap up for you so you are always

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,790
up to date with the data and then you've

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,910
fully free in your favorite programming

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,519
environment so iOS Android browser

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,680
plugins and so on next slide so this is

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,660
the last shot I invoke you arm use queue

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,150
or trouble net and this is the page you

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,660
can look up for more thank you very cool

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,660
