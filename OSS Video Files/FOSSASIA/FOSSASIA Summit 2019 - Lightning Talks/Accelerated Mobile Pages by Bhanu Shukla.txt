hello everyone welcome to the talk

00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:12,570
myself Hani Shukla I work as a UI in

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:14,519
here so my talk is on accelerated mobile

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,039
pages so basically we have been trying

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,350
to revolutionize and make the web faster

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,869
for all and we keep looking for the ways

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,810
to do it and accelerated mobile pages or

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,000
a MP is in short is what we have come to

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,160
please next slide

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,619
so yeah MP is a open source project

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,920
initiative aiming to make the web better

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,590
for all and it is basically it enables

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,149
creation of the web pages which are

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,739
lightning fast and with EMP the promise

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,200
is that the pages will be loaded

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:51,870
instantly these next slide so what is MP

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
made up of MP is basically three things

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,930
it has three components one is MP h TM l

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,020
which is a subset of the standard HTML

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:05,640
that we have and it forces it gives us

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,180
another set of tags like a HTML EMP

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,430
which makes the server's readability as

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,200
a accelerated page rather than just a

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,119
normal page then there is our MP

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,729
JavaScript which is for resource loading

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,610
and the MP cache which are like the

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,890
cache servers so the MP pages are served

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,110
from the directly from the and mostly

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,130
these servers are Google cache servers

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,130
next slide please

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:39,410
so yeah yeah yeah so what is of what it

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,110
offers it offers us tremendous increase

00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,660
in performance in terms of a huge

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,229
decrease in load times which is around

00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,710
75 percent in some cases and data usage

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:54,050
is also reduced by 10 times going to the

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,720
above - as we know if we take care of

00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,690
the above - we have will definitely have

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,930
increased user experience and engagement

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:05,149
so the media outlets are the pretty high

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,590
growing pretty high on the am piece and

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,190
they have mostly adopted because

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:19,790
everybody wants to be at better search

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:21,920
results options please next slide so so

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,250
EMP has already got a pretty good

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,720
adoption we already have 1.5 billion EMP

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,520
pages out there in production already

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,760
and it is why - were adopted very widely

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,650
and even though it has come to the party

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,670
after the Facebook instant articles and

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,500
Apple news but it has gone pretty huge

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,890
so there are a lot of criticism as we

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,799
are here at the open tech summit the

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,930
criticism is mostly about that Google is

00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,780
using to shape how the mobile web works

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,000
and in particular to ensure a steady

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,860
stream of revenue for themselves but if

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,620
we take the Google's point of view it's

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,140
a they don't claim it as a proprietary

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,430
and they have moved it out into a open

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,709
governance model next slide please

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,980
so is it necessary to really is it

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:16,400
really necessary to adopt EMP and so if

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,260
we see that Google is now the leader in

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,420
the search market with having a covering

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,790
the almost all most of the market share

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,530
so and to an extent that we have the

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,579
term Google it in the Oxford Dictionary

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,650
so to stay ahead of the competition it

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:33,290
becomes essential for content based

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,000
platforms to have EMP pages and all the

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,560
customer facing companies to have their

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,550
MP pages to have a better search engine

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,690
optimization

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:44,360
and most of the media server outlets

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,820
have already gone to serve the MPs next

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,450
slide please

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:52,910
so is it disrupting enough havi gone the

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,610
what we are getting with this so the

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,680
project is open source and we all are

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,060
aware about the googles dominance in

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,620
search space so with so it basically

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:14,300
doesn't go well with the deaf community

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:16,220
because the open so we as open-source

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,410
developers don't want to be dictated and

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,239
told that we should write certain thing

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,320
in certain restricted way we want to

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,840
have our own freedom so but yeah so it

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:33,280
almost dictates how the way HTML should

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,280
