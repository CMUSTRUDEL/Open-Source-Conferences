I'm neelima from the reality Hyderabad

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,250
and pursuing my second year of

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,580
engineering computer science so what is

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,530
AI instructor before this I want to pose

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:20,340
a question how many of you slept in the

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:23,910
class so this is where this idea comes

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,039
from I slept in my class many times and

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,380
the lecturer who is speaking doesn't

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,140
know I am sleeping or my friends

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,800
sleeping and he doesn't know what we are

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,700
doing so this is the inspiration for me

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,020
to start this project

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:45,660
ok next ok

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,579
the students in the class will do

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,930
various activities and have different

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,850
emotions and feelings while lecturer

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,640
teaching doesn't know anything about

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,640
these emotions and feelings so my

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,640
project they basically do the facial

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,489
facial recognization and detects the

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,740
emotions of the students so other

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,439
lecturer can know what are the feelings

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,850
and emotions of the student so he can

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:18,920
improve his techniques next slide this

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,409
is basically how my project works first

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,070
through video I the faces are recognized

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,710
and after that it sends to a motion

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,610
detection so the emotions are detected

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,420
and finally we'll get the percentages of

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:40,250
feelings of different students so this

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:49,200
is the project how it works next time

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:52,020
yeah next the facial is recognization is

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,720
basically the technology for identifying

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,420
or verifying the people so in my project

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,360
I am using facial recognization to

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,869
detect the faces of students and after

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,540
this detection I'll send my data to a

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:12,190
motion detection for the emotion

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:14,590
detection next line in this part

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,080
the different emotions of the students

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,100
is detected by different gestures and

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,100
their facial expressions and emotions so

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:29,070
that I can know what are the feelings

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:34,110
and actions they are using next okay

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:37,450
basically this is the project for

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,900
teachers and lecturers in the college so

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,610
it not only helps the teacher to enhance

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,470
the teaching techniques but also it

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,980
helps in detecting the students who are

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,590
slacking like me it also helps the

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:55,150
teacher to understand every student

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:57,640
clearly and in independent monitoring to

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,520
picture with big bigger picture it helps

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:05,659
in better quality of education thank you

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,659
