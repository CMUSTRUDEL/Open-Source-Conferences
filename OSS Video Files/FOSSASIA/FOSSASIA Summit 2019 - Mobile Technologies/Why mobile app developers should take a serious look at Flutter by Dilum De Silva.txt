Google claims that we live in a mobile-first era where a lot of users tend to use mobile devices and mobile apps within their daily routine. So, every user expects to have great performance, smooth animations, and beautiful interactive designs whenever they use a mobile application. also, most of the mobile application developers need to develop such applications and new features without compromising quality or performance. This is where flutter and its interesting features make us have serious look at it.
Flutter is Google's mobile UI framework which provides a fast and expressive way for developers to build native apps on both IOS and Android. Rather than just giving an introduction to flutter, I thought of covering a comparison between flutter and native application development to highlight the key points why flutter has become an all-rounder in terms of flexibility, easiness, and developer-friendliness.  This speech and the demo will focus on following areas such as Flutter’s cool features bundle for developers, Dart the language of flutter and flutter’s reactiveness and why everything in flutter based on widgets. Also during the demo, I am planning to build an application to make sure that the audience is grabbing every cool feature to have a serious look at Flutter.
