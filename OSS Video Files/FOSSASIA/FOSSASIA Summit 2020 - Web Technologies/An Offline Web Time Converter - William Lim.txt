Publication date: 2020-04-01
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Web Technologies
Description: 
	I will be talking about an easily accessible, customizable, and modern, free and open-source time converter (handles time zones) that everyone can use (https://wlwl2.github.io/time-converter/). I will also briefly talk about using Nintendo Joy-Cons to deliver presentations.

at the original topics where I think are

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:11,120
not suitable to be talked about at this

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,769
time I was going to talk about traveling

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,910
could the time converter her helps for

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,830
traveling and the joy Khan's help for

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,160
delivering presentations to large

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,529
audiences which it's a bit difficult to

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,519
do at this time so this morning I

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:34,670
decided to change the this the the

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:39,170
presentation so I got tired now but

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:43,390
and I'll just deliver this this this

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,390
edition of this talk

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:50,650
so today I'll discover six features of

00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,880
the time converter that are helpful in

00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:58,800
the current situation the first feature

00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:03,430
of the time converter is offline support

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,640
so the tongue cover I built works when

00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,240
you are offline after visiting it once

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,900
[Music]

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,950
whereas this there's a nice there's a

00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,950
nice infographic here

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,090
but when you go offline it this is what

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,090
it shows you

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:31,610
there's you can there's also data you

00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:36,540
can use here but if you go offline

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,590
that's what you get and all all of these

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,829
are the same

00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,829
[Music]

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,050
but you can give these websites offline

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,050
support as well

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:52,390
the next feature of the time converter

00:01:53,229 --> 00:02:00,670
is that time that I'm going to talk

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,770
about is the time critter itself which

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,369
looks something it should look like that

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:10,360
which is that it's good for remote work

00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:14,140
I use it I'm using it now

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,180
[Music]

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:23,860
the third feature that I'm gonna talk

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:29,560
about is how the tank over the time

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:33,340
converter deals with offsets so when I

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:37,510
when I started off I I thought I put the

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:40,870
offset at the I thought I put the offset

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,750
there at the bottom and then I decided

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:47,970
and then I thought maybe for it

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,970
discreetly on the right would be better

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,690
but then you look you look at everything

00:02:50,530 --> 00:03:01,180
and then it it's a bit confusing you

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:03,900
have to do calculations but you don't

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,930
read me - what button what happens if

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,630
when when you're in a different time

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,830
zone from your friends online you just

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:17,370
you just want the time right now and so

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,370
that's why it's like that

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,500
the fourth feature I'm going to talk

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,500
about is mobile support

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:31,860
the type of order works on smartphone

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,860
and desktop browser web problems

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,420
the fifth feature is DSC

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,830
so

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:50,900
you can you can tell if whether whether

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:55,600
or not a time zone is in IDs DST by

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,600
looking at the offset there

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:05,320
and there's a reminder if for if the

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,280
time zone has DST the time zone is

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,280
affected by DST

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:15,709
the final feature that I'm going to talk

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,620
about is that the time convertor is free

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:24,410
and open source and here are some

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:27,530
possible improvements that ship that

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,530
would be nice to happen a better

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,639
location search maybe accessibility

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,460
support for those low price devices

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,279
d'Este down to our although

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,490
[Music]

00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:46,419
that's a hard thing to do

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:49,060
format customization as in like maybe

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,570
you want to do a different date and time

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,570
format

00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:56,070
we'll be able to customize that

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,300
and you can contribute or use the

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,300
repository if you want to

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,590
and that's the end of the talk aha I

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,580
said when you weren't worried about time

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:14,720
thank you that's a cool little tool I

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,190
I'm going I'm going more in depth I

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,380
thought I'd because I'm giving a talk

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,260
but I I think I'm giving a talk next

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:27,030
week about with the same title and I

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:30,750
thought I would go in depth about the

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,570
code and libraries I'm using and about

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,230
time and I would discuss time itself

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:40,800
like in more detail but that might that

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:44,610
talk next week might be cancelled I'm

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,200
not sure about that 15 minutes is there

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,800
anything in that area you wanted want to

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,030
describe you've got 15 minutes do you

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,030
would you like to describe any of that

00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,630
time

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,960
like for example I'm using I and I a and

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,370
a time zones whereas I think there's an

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,900
altered there's only one alternative

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,720
which is Microsoft time zones I guess

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:19,120
that that's one example about

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,790
things I looked at - before I while

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,790
while I built the time originally

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,960
so so what's the trade-off there and

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:40,120
then I've sort of only ever used

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,400
Ayana time dens are there different I

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,600
think I think that Microsoft ones are

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:51,010
less updated compared to I which is I

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:56,200
think every every year or almost like

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:58,990
it's I am a ie and a time zones are very

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:02,170
they seem very updated I suspect that

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,360
it's rolling the veterans legislators

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,250
make a I'll just make changes that it

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,940
gets updated and others because the

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,640
Debian group had to move time zones at

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,420
one point into their ephemeral

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,490
distribution because they were getting

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,610
things like regular support they've such

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:21,010
as changing time zones a week before

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,750
change are going to effect so if you had

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,480
a time zone file that was six months old

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,700
it was useless so yeah I did

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,440
that's a there's a constantly evolving

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,880
document I'm just intrigued what the

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,980
trade-off is and why Microsoft is using

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,120
if you know why Microsoft is using a

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,120
different database

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,110
I'm not sure about I'm not sure about

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,110
that

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,000
ah gets please Peter I wouldn't the

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,260
question please repeat the question

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,480
another speaker please repeat the

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,320
question

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,250
speaker please repeat the question

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,510
before you answer it oh I can't hear the

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,580
question and online people can't do the

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,520
question so say what the question was

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,670
and then the answered what what what did

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:18,590
I think it's basically what did I do to

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:21,050
to bring my website online off wait give

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,340
off off off line support to my webs to

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,340
my to the time diverter

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:35,110
and so I used I used Gatsby and and it's

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:38,680
it's basically to give offline support

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:41,470
to the time convertor I'm using now I

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,440
used like one one line of code I think

00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,750
it's only like something like four four

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,410
words or something like that and that's

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,980
that's amazing because um when a few

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:59,560
months ago or a year ago I use service

00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:03,190
workers the service worker API and that

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:07,120
and that was a lot love work and and

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:11,440
Gatsby does it in in one package install

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,920
and one one one plug-in one line one

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
line at it

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,809
[Music]

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,990
are there any are there any more are

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,200
there any more questions

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:31,140
does anyone want to start

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,750
it was okay if you wanna reminisce if

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,430
you want to wrap its find a rap bring

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,110
like to talk on in ten minutes

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,060
nothing only China think so I think for

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,570
now I think for now because because of

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,220
the situation it's okay yeah yeah I feel

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,020
more difficult with Nash trunk audience

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,330
everywhere yet because because of the

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:53,720
topics I picked much appreciate thank

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,720
