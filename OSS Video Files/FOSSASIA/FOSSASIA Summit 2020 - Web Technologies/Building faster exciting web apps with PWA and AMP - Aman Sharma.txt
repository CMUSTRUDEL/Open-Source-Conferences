okay today we are going to talk about

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,940
building faster and exciting web apps

00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:17,029
with not so new but some very

00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:25,429
interesting technology such as PWA and a

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:29,179
MP so imma mention ma I am working as

00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:32,390
CTO at whim bit and also I am amp global

00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:35,899
contributor you can follow me for any

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,690
updates related to web apps if you want

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,129
to ask anything about pwace or a and B

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,890
I'm always happy to help

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:45,399
apart from pwn EMP I also work with

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,320
other open source technologies such as

00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,559
WordPress which is my favorite framework

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,079
so far and also in machine learning

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,219
aspects for example in recommender

00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,079
system intensive flow so let's begin

00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,969
well I would like to give you a little

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,100
bit of time to actually go through this

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:08,630
mean and this is something that happens

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,400
to our developers every day so I found

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,470
this on Pinterest

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,470
it says designing a software application

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,810
is like designing a boat you spend

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,850
countless hours locating the ideal

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,759
materials testing the engines to the

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,409
customer's exact specification only when

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,329
you are done the customer tells you

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,689
great job we love it just one little

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:31,899
thing we needed to fly so we know that a

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,829
customer don't understand ourself and

00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,869
developers have to go through a lot of

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:40,490
pain in order to get things clear and

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:43,070
finally like requirements change so this

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,380
is a main reason why we should not

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,110
actually go for native apps and that's

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,740
what my today's agenda is centered

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,880
around so just to get to know a little

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:59,570
bit of facts there are around zero

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,659
downloads that are happening every month

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:05,390
on an average on users phone the reason

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:09,229
being that people don't install native

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,900
apps too often it would be hardly a case

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,680
that there is a any trending app like

00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,090
new tick tock or maybe a new feature

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,280
sir Graham that you would like to upload

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,769
or download otherwise there is no chance

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,739
for a new beginner startup to actually

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:27,129
get into someone smartphone so that

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:30,879
brings us to zero downloads per month on

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:33,939
an average per user device and the sole

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,909
reason for this is that at every step of

00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:39,849
app download we use around 20% of our

00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:42,069
users some time it's bothering updates

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,900
related to the operating system or the

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,959
person has a login yet or the internet

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,159
speed is not too much as I am right now

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,500
in India and the internet speeds

00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,840
sometimes not as equivalent as we expect

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,010
to be so the things don't work out

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,500
pretty fine and it would be surprising

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,049
to know that 15 to 20 percent of our

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,269
cost of total app development it's just

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,980
spend on maintaining the app releasing

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,579
the updates releasing the security

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,459
fetches complying with the latest laws

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,799
and compliance created by the Google

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,439
Play Store or Apple App Store ends very

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,769
tough to get there and it takes out

00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,190
heating weeks on average to make a

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,840
feature pop from your discussion board

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,639
or brainstorming board to the actual

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,150
phone that's the facts that we're

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,699
talking about the answer to all these

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,639
problems is definitely progressive web

00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:39,159
apps so what are progressive web app it

00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,709
is nothing but your website being

00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,500
converted into a progressive app nature

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,889
which are reliable that means it works

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,439
also on low latency networks it's fast

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:53,259
because most of the files are cached on

00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,569
your device so it can work on low

00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:57,819
networks as smooth as possible and

00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,790
engaging it offers a lot of features

00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,470
that today unitive f can offer you can

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,419
also access them in progressive web apps

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,220
and that's how we did the PWA are

00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,099
becoming more and more native as you can

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,930
see in this example a person has just

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,000
found a link from chrome dev summit and

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,159
it pops to install it on his phone and

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,590
what it actually does it it converts

00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,150
that whole website into installing bill

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,669
major a full screen engaging thing

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,120
inside the phone and you are ready to go

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,910
so some people ask me oh man

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,949
what are the difference between native

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,960
apps and web apps capability I tell them

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,229
to see this sheet and you can see right

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,550
now in this sheet that most of the

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:43,510
present capabilities that native app

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,000
offers are also offered by three WS by

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,580
the time you are watching this there

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,260
have been more development on the p WS

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,660
and NFC things like NFC and SMS and

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,030
contact list is also being provided

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,830
through the native browser capabilities

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,080
of p WS so just to look into some of the

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,970
capabilities such as Bluetooth USB you

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,070
can detect network speed you can also go

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,600
for touch gestures as you can see here

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,110
you can go for Gio with all locations

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,060
and other things like that so if you

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,550
your next project involves any of these

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,600
capabilities I think PWS is a sure thing

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,520
to go for now I would tell you now that

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,449
how you can actually create your own

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,570
pwning

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,520
in four easy steps so assuming that you

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,229
already have your running website it can

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,389
be your blog it can be a recom as

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,820
website anything like that which has a

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,650
domain amad it's being served on

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,450
Internet that's the only requirement we

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,360
need so first thing you need to do is

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,580
obtain a ssl certificate which will

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,250
enable your HTTP link that's the

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,280
foremost requirement for having a PW way

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,960
this will provide a secure access to the

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,900
file so that they can be installed on

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,650
user smartphone so HTTPS is a must thing

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,349
to go

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,289
most of the hosting providers and domain

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,190
providers offer SSL service as

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,110
complimentary and free service these

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,349
days so it's not hard to get an SSL

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,720
certificate next thing we need to do is

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,419
to set up a manifest file this file

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,270
exists into the root folder of your app

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:18,099
or the website directory and it goes

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,960
like this if some of you are clear with

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,030
the native a philosophy you must

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,729
recognize a manifest file as the file

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,710
that gives it identity to your app what

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:29,949
are the logos what are the theme and

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,410
what is the home URL what kind of nature

00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:35,740
you want exactly the same we use for

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:38,710
pwace as you can see we have a short

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:42,160
name for the app we have the icons that

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,750
you want to set you have set a start URL

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,920
you have set a background color which

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,320
pops in the navigation bar on top and

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,910
also you have set the display mode now

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,650
display modes are interesting you can

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,120
make your app behave in different

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,040
display mode you can have it with

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,550
address bar you can have it without

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,560
address bar so stand alone is a thing

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,470
that has that dress bar on top full

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,990
screen is capability in which you don't

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:13,270
need a top url bar so this this is

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,640
something that's you you need to define

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,280
in order to get your apps or native feel

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,280
and I can that make it needs to show in

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,990
the a browser so the next thing we need

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
to do is the most important thing that

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,340
is setting up a serviceworker

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,070
now imagine serviceworker like an

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,590
assistant for your app the best

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,750
capability of PW that can perform is

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,240
that it doesn't need to check for the

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,490
server files every time a person

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,190
requests something even if he is on

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,170
offline your PW should be able to serve

00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,630
the request and that's what actually

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,170
serviceworker does it act as an

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,330
intermediary between the user and the

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:55,510
actual website and it caches all the

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,430
content from your website to the user so

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,140
that whenever the next time the user is

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,410
making a request he doesn't need to go

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,060
to the actual site again and again and

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,280
that's how you can set up your

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,590
serviceworker and you can define it what

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,000
files you want to do there are a couple

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,160
of easy ways to set up your own

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,950
serviceworker if you have developed your

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,070
website on WordPress you can use the

00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:21,010
plug-in super PW way or the PW from

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:24,220
original developers WordPress developers

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,530
and you can get your website running

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,300
from the serviceworker site or otherwise

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,790
if you are working on your own custom

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,490
project on a framework like react you

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,360
can use the PWA libraries offered by yet

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,520
and a universal solution is the work box

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,849
you can visit web tour death that is

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,160
Google's official website for EWS and

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,290
web development things and you can learn

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,450
more about work box which offers

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,770
different API capabilities and does the

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,280
caching for you so that you don't need

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,240
to recur at your own serviceworker the

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,930
last thing we need to do

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,330
is actually test our pwe so for this

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,660
chrome offers a plug-in capability

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,360
called as lighthouse if you have the

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,640
latest Chrome browser this exists under

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,470
the audit app and this helps you

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,170
actually track how well your PW is

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,610
performing now you would see that people

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,620
are gaining hundred one hundred scores

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,660
but today I am going to get a little bit

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,250
real and me I'm going to show you what

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:28,140
actually appeared of this course looks

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:38,709
like so I have created our own bwa and

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:40,630
this so this is a PW a and this is the

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,850
lighthouse exist under the audit tab

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,620
inside your inspect element tool and

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,180
what you need to do you just need to

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,040
click on the plus button and click on

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,260
generate report what this will do this

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,690
will render your app and we'll check for

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,339
different functions and will actually

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,470
give you the final score of your app

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,600
however your app is performing now you

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,360
can see we have a performance score of

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,230
89 which is not pretty bad but also not

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,029
good we can see different scores which

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,810
shows how well our app is loading and

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,360
things like that

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,850
and other capabilities PW lighthouse

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,010
also suggest you how you can improve

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,660
your PW score you can follow these tips

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,360
and tricks in order to increase your PW

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,980
score now I would like to also show you

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,740
there is another tab called as

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,990
application tab and if you want to check

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,620
if your manifest file is working as as

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,149
intended you can go inside your

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,640
application tab and you can see inside

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:36,959
the manifest folder if everything is

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:41,200
done correctly then your service worker

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,959
is actually stored has all the states

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,010
over here can go in detail and check if

00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:50,020
your PW is working fine and also the

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,670
storage how much storage your PW is

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,020
actually consuming you can check it over

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,220
here

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,220
[Music]

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,839
okay so the last thing that was

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,120
remaining that if you still want to

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,760
place your PW into Google Playstore just

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,620
to increase the visibility Google

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,500
recently launched another package called

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,589
STW a known as trusted web activity and

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,600
it provides you a ready-made android

00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:27,860
adapter kind of thing in which you can

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,380
put up your own normal PWA files your

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,450
website files and that app automatically

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,839
converts into a native app which you can

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,700
then launch into a Play Store so that's

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,370
amazing most of the time you would

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,170
expect your PWA to render as fast as

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,810
nativist because that's what we intend

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,600
but most of the time you see a loading

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,270
screen like this because of maybe low

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,250
internet speed expired packaged or maybe

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,610
you are on your flight you cannot access

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:58,610
a PW because of this thing and that

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,649
actually is a speed issue slow web sites

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,110
cause lot of irritation and problems to

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:05,540
people slow learning web sites irritates

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,820
because the pieces are unresponsive on

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,130
the first glance and sometimes the

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,200
content is actually displaced by ads and

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,829
you accidentally click on ads instead of

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,709
clicking on the actual content so and

00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:20,480
also according to a Google report 50% of

00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:22,100
users we leave your website if it

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,260
doesn't loads under three seconds and

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,820
that's the case most of the time your

00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,649
website doesn't lower the three seconds

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,149
people get irritated in this just switch

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,490
it close the tab and move to another

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:36,890
website that dose will be faster so

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,770
today I have an interesting thing for

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,260
you that actually can help you increase

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,980
the speed of your website and let's go

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,980
and see it

00:12:45,520 --> 00:14:07,340
[Music]

00:13:06,380 --> 00:14:11,090
Oh what is so M stands for accelerated

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,890
mobile pages it's it's actually of web

00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,320
frameworks now that frameworks must not

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,110
be new for you people use web frameworks

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,420
for variety of features they may use it

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,850
for some kind of capabilities like

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,640
virtual No if you use react angular or

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,990
any other virtual Dom based JavaScript

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,540
library

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,240
we use frameworks to an answer

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,970
capability for example we use work box

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,280
for the PWI nature but amp here is a

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,200
special framework why because it's a

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,500
framework that is designed to enforce

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,230
best practices inside your web project

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,390
we are talking about performance that

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,210
ensures that your website always loads

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,800
in quicker time and accessibility or

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,020
most of the people don't care about

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,720
accessibility but it's very important

00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,740
for your website to work across all

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,360
different challenged scenarios and

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,790
accessibility is a thing that makes sure

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,400
of that reliability that even your

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,340
website loads on low latency network and

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,410
responsive design we developers mostly

00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,050
think of other mobile design or text of

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,760
design but amp ensures that your website

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,990
is responsive automatically by default

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,470
on both on all different

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,750
devices what also makes an a very

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,149
interesting framework is a small

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,680
learning curve you don't need to learn a

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,350
lot of things before you are actually

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,170
jumping into amp and we will see how a

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,990
pitcher does that so AB has three major

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,470
components of HTML and JavaScript and

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:44,010
fan caching and hTML is an extended

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,370
version of normal HTML tags we just

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:50,850
changed normal syntax is like we use am

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,010
IMG instead of IMG tag and other

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,370
different things and we will see some of

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:59,430
the examples and upcoming slides and

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,959
what it actually does is it was noticed

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,480
that most of the time the normal

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,420
rendering function that we include in

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,890
our website don't work as expected

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,110
because somehow we don't implement them

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:14,279
rightly so instead of using traditional

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:17,160
HTML tags we extend them to amp as HTML

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,440
tags and we replace those tags also I am

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,380
doesn't endorse you to include custom

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,510
JavaScript because custom Java scripts

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,730
are no single thread sometimes and it is

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,040
heavy which you are not using at all and

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,100
it slows down the overall performance of

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,560
your that website or web app and that's

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,300
why a javascript is disabled by default

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,950
you can use a script which is an

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,620
extended version in which you can

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,560
enabled your own custom JavaScript

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,600
inside the am script tag and also

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,490
validator is the functionality which

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,230
helps you track the performance and

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,899
accessibility of the website that you

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:55,950
have just created and am cache is an

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:57,959
interesting thing and cachet helps you

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,630
to cache your website on the Google

00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:03,480
servers on fly so that whenever someone

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:06,059
sees a bolt icon next to your website in

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,069
Google search results the website

00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,140
actually loads instantly and it doesn't

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,179
has any load time at all so that is

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,209
actually done by am Keshi and if your

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:17,220
website is 100% am valid your website

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,150
will be automatically cached as our

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,770
cached web site on Google server and

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,449
learning amp for web development has a

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,860
very small learning curve as we

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,500
discussed earlier it uses standard

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:32,230
components like HTML CSS and Java

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,540
it is compatible with mostly all modern

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,240
browsers because it doesn't add any new

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,310
web capability on itself it uses the

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,310
existing normal HTML CSS in JavaScript

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:45,580
and it is not dependent on special tool

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,590
you don't need a very cool ID or any

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,360
other interpreter to work on amp you

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,190
just need you can just start working

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,350
with your notepad and that's it

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,070
everything is component based there is

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,930
no boilerplate code but so ever and

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,720
whatever you need to use inside your

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,970
website you just need to include those

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,190
components and that's it you can learn

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,910
best practices by example and that's

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:13,110
what you can visit am door dev for now

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,850
amp offers a lot of components and it's

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,700
different features and different sets so

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,590
that it covers almost all of the web

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,720
capabilities that are existing today and

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,260
we are going to talk about them one by

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,840
one so amp website is the biggest of

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,600
them and am web site help you to create

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,460
user first website that loads nearly

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,980
instantly and there are very smooth and

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,230
compelling so what is the am website

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,380
it's nothing but a modified version of

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,690
your normal HTML website into amps and

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,790
texts website as you can see in this

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,520
example we have converted a normal I am

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:52,650
G tag into a by MC tag which has made

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,970
our image automatically lazy loading and

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,580
responsive in different screens we don't

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,380
need to also worry about different crop

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,520
aspects and things like that and take

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,410
cares of itself also think that we were

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,930
discussing before the app cache is

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,380
automatically provided if your web's

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,140
website is 100% and valid as you can see

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,870
in this example this website currently

00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,940
is fully and cached and it loads

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,940
directly inside Google search results

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,480
without wasting time on actually loading

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,480
the website

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,080
and there are a couple of other features

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,020
also that makes em website they're

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,590
unique so here is another example which

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,049
you can say as hello world of am most of

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,169
our websites use geo tagging or

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:47,270
analytics tools which really slows down

00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,530
the process because it's a huge library

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,880
that's included and also it is running

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,470
persistently back in the background of

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
the website even if the website loads

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,620
which slow down the device speed and

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,929
also consumes lot of battery power so

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,559
what am geotags or amp analytics tax

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:10,160
does is it actually converts the normal

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,530
working and functionality into a smooth

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,929
and low power consuming capability and

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,970
it only sends the data when the page is

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:19,190
loaded so even on the low latency

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,330
networks the website will work as smooth

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:25,100
as possible now the next components

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,890
being offered by AB is called amp

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,320
stories and stories are a compelling way

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,419
to narrate your own visual stories if

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,299
you are familiar with Instagram or

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:37,580
snapchat or whatsapp they offer a story

00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:40,910
capability built in their app but the

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:43,130
problem with these is you cannot choke

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:46,610
is these stories outside the scope of

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,679
that app and it's also gets deleted

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,630
after 24 hours so there is no weight you

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,030
can use them to share but it has proven

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,210
to be the most engaging way of viewing

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:58,970
the content and am stories is actually a

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:02,480
HTML syntax so that you can make your

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,160
own tap able stories what makes them

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,760
interesting is that they are fast

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,860
loading it offers all the capabilities

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,290
of amp and also you can use them in

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,809
full-screen mode it works exactly like

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,330
how our native story feature works they

00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,970
are tap able and they are very easy to

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,400
create and they have some inbuilt cool

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,520
animation features that you can use to

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,610
create engaging experiences I would like

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,760
to show you that how amp story has

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,980
changed the overall viewing experience

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
so this is my community called as mobile

00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,580
web dev we were previously using a

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,860
traditional web site but now we are

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,559
using amp story as the landing page of

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,780
our web site and you can see how

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,000
interesting it is that all the things

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,400
that we want to show to our audience is

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,980
in a capable format and the user doesn't

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,960
needs to scroll down find a thing it's

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,090
just a pible over here it is also a

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,880
sidebar in which they can find other

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,470
things and navigation options they want

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,179
if they want to share their design but

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,750
sheer native app options and you click

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,400
and share in their phone or desktop

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,620
let's go inside the code and let's see

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,510
how complicated or simple this thing is

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,600
so you can see there is a amp story

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:17,150
wrapper this is the main component which

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,760
defines the overall view of your cam

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:25,520
story then you have an amp sidebar that

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:28,669
is this thing and then you have

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,940
different amp story pages you just need

00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:36,470
to define your ramp story pages in this

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,970
format and the grids are actually the

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:43,490
different content layers that you are

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:46,159
having inside your amp story as you can

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:51,620
see in this one then you can write your

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,690
custom CSS which is on in the head to

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,929
add some more customization and things

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,929
like that

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,390
I'm also am show is also offers a lot of

00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,980
benefit usually we need one of the

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,850
interesting feature that I like the most

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:13,400
usually you need a very high analytic

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,320
tool in order to track if what section

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,530
of your website user is actually going

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,600
but by default amp stories of offer a

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,570
capability in which you can drag down

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,790
until which tap able screen the user is

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,120
reaching out so that you can track what

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:31,280
is the reach of your amp story different

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,620
slides of your am story you can directly

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,140
integrate Google Analytics to have that

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:42,020
feature and also it is very easy to

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:44,210
share as we saw you now am adds another

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,030
is another capability being offered from

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,980
amp and ads are really not interesting

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:53,610
thing for us and the problem is that

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,770
and usually ads usually load slower

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,100
because it has high-resolution images

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:02,400
and it actually degrades the overall

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,350
visibility of your app so amp ads on the

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,410
other hand is an interesting way to load

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:10,950
your ads also instantly it is compatible

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:13,530
with normally all modern ad platforms

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,710
like Google ads and you can just include

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,630
your ad stack in order to show your

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:24,480
Google ads inside your website which

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:27,090
loads instantly now an email is most

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,730
important can be said um important

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,860
feature Normandy now these days this

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:35,340
email feature is being exercised in

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,900
almost all the Google services and one

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,640
of the persons said that it is the

00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,040
biggest thing that has happened to email

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,710
since the creation of email and that's

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,190
called true to imagine the capability

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:49,260
that what if any user that is opening

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,059
your email can directly interact with

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,049
the content inside your email without

00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:57,780
actually jumping out of that scope and

00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:59,760
like for example rating you're giving a

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,120
feedback or rating your content or

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,240
filling out a form they can do it inside

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,429
the email only if you have noticed

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,620
recently if you share a Google Doc with

00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:12,960
anyone there is a bolt icon and that

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,850
shows life changes of the document

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,620
directly inside your email that is a

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:21,240
capability that is offered by a female

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,340
and it's obviously offered by most of

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,440
the email providers such as Gmail mail

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:30,240
are you or hablo com that was all that

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,090
app offers and now it's your turn to

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,820
actually turn your website superfast by

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,940
using amp and how you can do that is by

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,669
learning am through am door dev am door

dev offers great variety of starting

00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,510
material guides and tutorials different

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,120
components different examples different

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:54,390
courses and you can go through all of

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:56,760
them and become am developer so you can

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,429
go to am dot dev and all these things

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,679
that I just said in the whole thing is

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,640
actually being documented and we'll

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:10,710
presented on

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:13,890
or death contributing is the way that

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,140
keeps us happy our developers and also

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,850
it expands the reach of any framework if

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,880
it's good it should be good for everyone

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:23,100
and you can help in contributing to amp

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,620
by helping in documentation creating

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,200
learning material and testing and

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,470
finding bugs there is new release almost

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,720
every week you can say and you can help

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,840
us to reach more and more better

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,730
features and add capabilities so what

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,970
did we learn today was a lethal

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,490
combination of pwdfocus a web apps and

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,400
amp accelerated mobile pages which

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,320
creates a high-speed web experience

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,500
which is installable like a native app

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,960
and also fast like a native app that

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,840
brings us to a conclusion that every app

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,840
that is fast and consumes less internets

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,360
creates let's load on the servers make

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,450
making earth a greener place so with

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:11,670
that thanks a lot in being my lovely
