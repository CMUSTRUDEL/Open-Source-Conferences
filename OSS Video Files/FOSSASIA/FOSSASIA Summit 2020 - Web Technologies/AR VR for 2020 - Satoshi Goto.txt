hello everyone today I will talk about

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,349
AR we are 2020

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:14,759
my name is a Satoshi Oppo this look back

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:19,890
at history of the area the concept that

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:22,949
has been there since 1930 and in 1961

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,099
Scott separated the first VAR gadget

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:30,810
which is like this it's a huge amount

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:33,899
set completed current one but then the

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:39,300
and also the very narrow uncool but

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:42,239
still works but not like the 360 the in

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,040
the Nintendo also brought us the but

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,219
another virtual reality which is

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,879
aperture boy inside here it's ever since

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,680
I read and in black but still it works

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,270
but I couldn't become the popular

00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,969
unlike the Nintendo's Super Nintendo

00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:09,630
some other gadgets a Nintendo introduced

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:13,979
2016 it was it's called a camp real era

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:17,700
at that time they're a bunch of the we

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,350
are gadget has been introduced 2016

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,970
Google cardboard something here

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:29,030
PlayStation VR oculus rift HR we are by

00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:34,290
much clip Microsoft horror aims exact

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:38,240
there with a product this magic clip and

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:42,210
also the whole range this is a work air

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:46,170
the mix reality which you can still see

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,500
the RT with the digital contents whether

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:54,540
others mostly this one is a purely de

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,939
pere virtual reality and if you file

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,520
started to this fire was the oculus

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,049
founder he actually looking for this

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,509
kind of gadget 2008 or 2009

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,890
I couldn't find in that at that time the

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:13,239
market the he end up having owned the

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:19,540
gadget they he started kick-started the

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:22,930
own company and in the mid prototype the

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,530
venturi Facebook founded a gadget and in

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,290
the much the company what's the

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,510
difference between a Oregon period here

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,810
is an argument reality which you can

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,989
have digital contents is a reality

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,390
whether we are is a virtual reality it's

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:44,819
a purely hundred-percent the digital

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:48,400
contents oculus quest husband did this

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:54,459
last year 2002 thousand nineteen to

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,560
churn zeidel is this new concept which

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:01,750
is this like the oculus case they have

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,739
no cable sixty away mature IDE so they

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:10,750
have to mainly famous right easier than

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:15,690
360 degree and the audio is inside there

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:20,079
so the Y is a huge leap completely other

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:23,019
but in reality VR is the new cable you

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,420
can find your own the pre area you can

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:29,799
you can just create your own playing

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,260
area then you don't have to connect you

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,850
to any other console like the PC or Mac

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:41,920
wasn't necessary 60 or I will explain

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:45,670
this more later here is 60 wave passes

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,400
3d wave 3d with it if you move the other

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,769
which shift is also moving 60 wave if

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,280
you are moving the other other aqua tech

00:03:50,769 --> 00:04:00,280
doesn't move doesn't means it's almost

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:03,489
similar to DRT because of this reason 60

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,980
or F is more popular of course it's more

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:10,860
adapted by many

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:13,770
cadet 3 DOF is previously oculus gadget

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:19,980
is called Carrasco is adapting this

00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:26,190
video ID they have two major ID for

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:31,850
oculus oculus vibes told we are creation

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:35,730
one is unity unity you can bring the 3d

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:39,270
bottle inside here then changed anchor

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:42,960
you can try to write the whole script in

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,780
a shop and then yeah you can create a

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,750
game targeting to the Multipla home it's

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,669
not only oculus power so the mobile

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:57,360
Android and the iOS and the Linux Mac

00:04:53,669 --> 00:05:00,720
the windows to whether this and

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,130
rearranging this one is also popular

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,110
it's a graphic white very exact many

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,860
people may need develop a praise about

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,729
this one very versatile if you wanna

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,830
write the script C++ but mostly you

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:20,910
don't have to write a code because a

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:25,080
blueprint that you can just bring some

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:31,350
node then graphically you can make a

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:35,580
program we are seriously just scaring

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:40,340
and going up especially after the oculus

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:44,940
quest husband it is it's skyrocketing

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:47,490
also like since the coronavirus issued

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,890
now many people still at home they are

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,729
looking food home entertainment because

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,460
that is another reason they may wanna

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,320
find this one also they can watch it on

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,320
Netflix in term here you don't have to

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,650
buy huge screen the shooter screen is

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,530
already prepared if you just to play

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,070
Netflix application and also you have

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:13,020
very nice codes easily inside their data

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,600
atmosphere it's very nice

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,670
so you don't have to care about your own

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:25,010
space do you miss the interior the rock

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:29,370
tin Hakkasan in the last year October we

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:33,030
we hold this event the many people's

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:36,240
party that came in and then we re

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,810
targeting for this area things as a

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,720
topic the many people brought us a very

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,380
interesting idea and the one of them is

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,400
like this so that is can show you

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:53,340
so the in some debris are decorated the

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,750
cooking system cooking application so

00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:00,930
they can flip the hamburger is also

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:06,690
making spaghetti sandwich they can

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:10,470
practice in this application solution

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,750
for WR they have many but mainly many

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,130
people is going to the game first the

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:19,170
game is you can similar actress to the

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:25,220
Google Play you can create application

00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:29,100
then publish to the oculus to the steam

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,930
they many people can download also it's

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,520
very famous and Caicedo

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,770
quest that is a another indie game

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,630
marketplace you can just also approach

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,530
there then people can purchase what

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,750
people can download freely

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,290
another one is a training before going

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,920
to further means early before training

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:57,300
in the DRT people can train themselves

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,340
inside this aperture DRT another one is

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
an experience before the purchase means

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,820
like if

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,220
if trying to purchase that is a very

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,630
expensive use either case the first we

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:13,170
decree to the butter we are then let

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,930
them experience see what's going on

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,870
there then after that experience they

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:25,020
can change that we are we are one let's

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:28,650
say like before creating the building in

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:32,310
Singapore this HDTV or some condo for

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,510
example before creating that one we can

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,490
create a batch or ERT

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,090
you can go there you can just check

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,360
about the stairs to a window anything

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,920
sitting then you can see like find like

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,490
how you feel about this

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,490
the image are go into the r1 so that is

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,370
another way of which I use use solution

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:56,850
for the error the operating this is a

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:02,000
navigation be our reality you can also

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:04,920
see the digital contents also the game

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,500
most famous are about the air is a

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:13,430
common goal maybe you can just walk go

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,110
somewhere then find the character catch

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:19,620
but everything is happening from camera

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,780
the game demo so the habilitation

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,620
content so it's mixed the digital

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:30,030
contents and in the deity object

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,560
detection nowaday the formula AI we can

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:36,840
find we can identify what this object is

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,020
based on that that this is also same

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,180
like the theater camera we see the

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,250
reality in from the camera they can

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,360
detect the object and find the name of

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:52,350
the object we are is much air is not

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,490
much why it's because the air is still

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,800
using AI the AI is still no mature

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,250
freedom to the self-driving circle

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:07,400
driving is not too much

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:11,720
it's not completed yet same goes air is

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,660
we have still use you have to use AI the

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,390
technology so then since it's not

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,310
completed so AR is no mature we are is

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,350
much it's because everything is that

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,310
these are contains the serial game

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,700
itself everything is a concrete in

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,630
everything

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,670
these are contains so that is doesn't

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,270
have to interact with a reactive so that

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:38,990
means basically that you can create a

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,040
very nice the game in subject we are

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,970
benefit

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:49,280
like I say saving the space a CEREC if

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:51,620
you create the we are meeting room in

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,800
the physical meeting room

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,310
they are limit limit somebody is using

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,890
then you cannot use that one but then

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:06,080
you you have the digital meeting room

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:11,540
you just wear this we are the Hitmen say

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,940
Tandy you can join that meeting without

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,600
carrying the distance without carrying

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:22,100
about a space you can share talk share

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,860
the screen and then also yeah you can

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,730
have the conversation tear to a victory

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:32,450
motion let's talk let's say the horror

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,550
game horror game in the 2d screen it's

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,660
not to just yet because you can still

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:41,540
see the reality but if we talk about the

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,450
360 all degree all surrounded by the

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,480
horror atmosphere you may feel very very

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,650
scared extended 3rt

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,100
this is a another reality which you

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:56,440
the current to you you just face or only

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,290
Artie but if you just wear this one you

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,810
can extend you can beyond the actual

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,590
reality music you can go further like

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:09,010
the scientific movie like Star Wars or

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:12,460
something you can create that kind of

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:16,870
like imagination imaginative what is

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:19,690
he'll disappear even benefit is extended

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,630
reality same goals same as we are the

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:30,520
bridge between an organ injector we

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:34,630
Google grass has been introduced maybe

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:40,660
like seven eight years ago the entire

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:45,310
concept is still yeah so the idea is

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:47,290
basically we just see the reality with a

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,640
potential contents if we want to find

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:54,400
somebody's name but just by seeing the

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,060
person's face we can detect the person's

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,930
information like that so we are still in

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:05,140
this stage it's still immature

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:08,920
it's not mysterious progress make making

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:13,960
progress by many companies market growth

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:19,230
is it's just growing especially after

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:22,720
this Krampus session people may find

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,750
they are we are especially our group is

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,380
another solution because everything's

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,240
are remotely you can connect and also we

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,040
don't have to care about a distance we

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,500
don't have to care about yeah

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,670
directly the location wise you can still

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:43,540
talk to other people via this video you

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:47,900
may still feel like VRT okay so this is

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:56,340
a demo which I created some other game

00:13:47,900 --> 00:14:00,360
BRDC unity I can show you one a unity

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,490
which are created for the game and in

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,520
this area are drama what is a pre are

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:12,540
drama it's because the drama is you can

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,640
pray like if somebody may not be to save

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,850
oh it's kind of similar

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,060
you just hit the objective since it's

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,280
coming to the character to the player so

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:28,650
you just hit but that isn't around so

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:31,230
simple and then the snare it's keep

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:36,090
coming and you just hit and then hear

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:45,050
the sound of this drum based on the

00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:48,150
music that's what I have made so late

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,150
[Music]

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:07,770
it's just to keep coming the snail the

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:13,560
sim bar with and then it's just hit

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:16,320
it's basically that's it it's only one

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,930
week I just created and him

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,220
maybe if I finish everything I will

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:30,930
upload to the side or Southwest maybe so

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:34,110
like this okay so let's talk more about

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,200
other application in doctress progress

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:43,030
the havoc let's say you need to nexus to

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:47,980
be are you can see you can see

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:51,630
the basketball game beer this we are you

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,670
don't have to go to the stadium you just

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,870
it can be easier we had this we are

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,200
touch it

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:01,500
which you can feel very reality then you

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,300
don't have to purchase that you

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:08,730
expensive ticket also this is another

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:11,590
case I mentioned I could be you probably

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,170
before building the actual architecture

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,310
you can experience it that one with the

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:22,900
weights at work with so those stuff can

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:27,310
be created in the bottle ERT also this

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,550
is another one the physical operation of

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:34,270
constantly the human body the operating

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:38,140
human body is very it's critical things

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:41,830
so before going further to can practice

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:46,900
by using this prior catch it until they

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:50,830
can see the mix racketeer but yeah you

00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:54,910
can explain how you feel about the

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:58,450
surface operation also this is another

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,170
case like it you can drive but the same

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,790
time you can see the navigation you

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,220
don't have to see the small tiny

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,240
navigation you can just see serie de

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,750
gracias

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,250
so the front the front grass and then

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,140
they will show you the all the

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:23,380
information the another case is that

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:27,370
abusing abusing abusing kids so let's

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,530
see how do you feel about this like most

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,170
apparent if you have multiple that this

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:35,380
parent is abusing kids you can be the

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,780
person you can visit a kid they from the

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:42,880
kids point of view you can feel how here

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:48,250
these cases by sharing this one with

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:52,590
other people they are twisting no since

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:56,340
they know how the kid feel if we

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:59,700
school the kids like Jane we probably

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,870
may improve how we can be happy to the

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,429
kids exactly

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:08,669
so this is a experience sharing another

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:13,830
case exactly yeah to the game you can

00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:16,740
play game by the selector

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,320
here's the wood and in test beta is here

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,740
you probably don't have any chance to

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,270
see him but then of course if we bring

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,460
this kind of character instead we are

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:31,049
you may feel the arty you may feel so

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,820
that is another great things you can

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:40,230
praise you know this lacks a ball sound

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:43,919
and also fight this is another things

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,840
actually in 2020 now what he brought I

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,669
can obviously brought to the handle

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,450
recognition you don't have to have the

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:54,029
controller only with you amount headset

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,490
you can see your heart and in your heart

00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:59,539
can interact with the game there is

00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,539
another great things

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:07,710
yeah so so that's it thank you so much

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,169
for listening here is my link ringing
