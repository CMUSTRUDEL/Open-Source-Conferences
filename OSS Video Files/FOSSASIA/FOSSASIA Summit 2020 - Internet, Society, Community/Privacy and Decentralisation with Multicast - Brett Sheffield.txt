Description: 
	Written in 2001, RFC 3170 states: "IP Multicast will play a prominent role on the Internet in the coming years. It is a requirement, not an option, if the Internet is going to scale. Multicast allows application developers to add more functionality without significantly impacting the network."  Nearly two decades later, multicast is still largely ignored and misunderstood.  There are many common misconceptions about multicast, including that it is only useful for streaming video and audio. It does so much more than that.  This talk explains why multicast is the missing piece in the decentralisation puzzle, how multicast can help the Internet continue to scale, better protect our privacy and democracy, solve IoT problems and make polar bears happier at the same time.
