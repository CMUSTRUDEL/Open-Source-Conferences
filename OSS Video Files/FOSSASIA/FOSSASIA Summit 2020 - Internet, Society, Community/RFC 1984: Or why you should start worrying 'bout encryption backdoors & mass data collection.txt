Title: RFC 1984: Or why you should start worrying 'bout encryption backdoors & mass data collection
Publication date: 2020-03-27
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Internet, Society, Community
Description: 
	In 1996 Brian E. Carpenter of IAB and Fred Baker of IETF wrote a co-statement on cryptographic technology and the internet. This RFC wasn't a request for a technical standard, it was a statement on their concerns about Governments trying to restrict or interfere with cryptography. They felt that there was a need to offer "All Internet Users an adequate degree of privacy" Since that time successive governments around the world have sought to build back doors into encrypted apps and services to access more citizen and visitor data. As of July 2019, the AG of the United States William Barr stated: “Some argue that, to achieve at best a slight incremental improvement in security, it is worth imposing a massive cost on society in the form of degraded safety,” i.e For security Americans should accept weakened encryption. The head of the FBI also claimed that weakened encryption wouldn't break it. In Australia the metadata retention laws have been abused against journalists with 58 searches carried out by the AFP. In 2015 ACT police carried out 115 metadata searches. UK officials have a cavalier attitude to the EU SIS database which tracks undocumented migrants, missing people, stolen cars, or suspected criminals. IETF Session 105 mentioned privacy and concerns with the mass collection of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried about US export controls on cryptography there is an argument for RFC 1984 to be updated to include the unnecessary mass collection of data and to use it as a term for IT professionals, privacy advocates and the public to rally behind. In this talk let's recount a brief history of governments around the world wanting to weaken encryption as RFC 1984 warned us about. We live in a time where citizens put data into commercial, healthcare and Government systems to access services, some services are only accessible online. From CCTV to Facebook people have little understanding of why mass collection of data is dangerous. There is little scrutiny of who can access that data, from Scotland to the US. Open Surveillance is only a small part of the picture when profiling citizens. It still counts as personal data, when combined with metadata and the actual data that people put into social media and services like ancestor DNA test kits. Businesses who use CCTV have to put up signs to warn the public they are recording. So called anonymized data still contains identifiers that can tie to individuals. Let's talk about Ovid and peacocks. Let's explore how to expand the RFC to cover recent developments in surveillance capitalism with governments accessing that data, but not securing it. We need to make it clear weakened encryption, the mass collection and careless retention of data isn't acceptable. We need to update and implement RFC 1984.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
so welcome to the stage Esther Payne

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,859
who's going to be talking here at for

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,179
Seder of our RFC in 1984 or why you

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:15,780
should start worrying about encryption

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:18,570
backdoors and mass data collection and

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,609
good afternoon the audience of tomorrow

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,500
literally tomorrow because I'm currently

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:30,449
recording this to the night before and

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:33,390
the reason for that isn't for their so

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,260
safety is very important so we'll just

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,770
get started

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,410
from last night before we begin I want

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,770
you to have a look at a picture of this

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,680
lovely French frog no frogs were harmed

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,289
in the making of this presentation but

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,469
cannot concentrate on that frog and I'm

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,980
metaphor with putting that poor frog

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,620
right there in a pan of water and slowly

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,559
heating that pan up while I see a few

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,510
statements to you so do we need privacy

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,250
all of our family and friends are using

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,580
social media and they're putting all

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,770
sorts of information up about you and

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,540
their friends and other members of the

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,000
family so everything's just up there and

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,280
teenagers well since the early 2000s

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,740
teenagers have been putting everything

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,310
up about themselves and communicating

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,470
with each other using social networks so

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,759
it's pointless little privacy oh the

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,110
window we don't need it we're in a

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,860
connected world now and because of all

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,590
the threats to our way of life like

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,390
terrorists like pandemics we need to

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,490
give up a little bit of that privacy for

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:55,140
our own security so yeah that water

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,450
feeling a tiny little bit more maybe so

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,509
we are very difficult for the problem

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,759
space we've got to try and explain that

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,320
privacy in ways that people can

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,840
understand that how what they put online

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,510
can affect them in real life

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,780
no this isn't the first time humanity

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,000
has had to face this at the time when

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,459
cities were being built civilizations

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,959
were in continual improving how did you

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,700
convince your general populace that

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,590
perhaps they want to follow the rules

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,569
ancient Greece harder things like

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,629
Aesop's fables and to some extent with

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,390
Greek mythology which leads us on to

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:38,629
this guy he's not Greek he's actually a

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,750
Roman and his name was orbital Nana he

00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:45,620
was famous because he was a poet in the

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,049
team of the Lateran of Justice Augustus

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,450
who had learned from his predecessors

00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:52,910
not to go an openly grab hold and

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,769
declare yourself dictator had gone in

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,390
who doing little man Republic into

00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,640
thinking that they were still a

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,610
democracy and everything was alright

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,700
because he was averse citizen of it

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,319
tended to write about gods and goddesses

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,000
and how their wellness and decisions

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,700
affected those in the Lord pecking order

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,840
humanity and lower orders of

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,099
supernatural entities ranking Nimitz now

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,370
you might think that this is just

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,609
mythology in Roman times mythology was

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,930
intrinsically tied in with the state

00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,060
Julius Caesar had been recently made a

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,450
god and Augustus after his death would

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,349
also become a god so when he was when

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,519
Ovid was writing about mythology and

00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:40,880
criticizing the father of the Gods

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,870
Jupiter and Roman Zeus and Greek he was

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,940
explicitly critiquing the regime

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,459
unfortunately he did that and it ended

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,250
up with him being exiled the main reason

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,420
was because of her

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,690
publication hero which was called the

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,670
ARS automata which was about how to get

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,950
women's names just pick him up and then

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,980
get rid of them again we just were bored

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:08,330
of them and it was also a little bit of

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,430
a a rumor about him having a good time

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,770
with them Augustus is going daughter

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,080
Julia no one's really quite sure he

00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,959
ended up in exile on the Black Sea in

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,060
modern-day Constanza and he kept

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,350
occasionally trying to ask to be brought

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,470
back in in from exile and Augustus said

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,930
no and his Peter his successor Tiberius

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,410
also Sentinel SOVA died

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,000
salty and pretty upset about it but why

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,300
am I telling you about over or what open

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,190
dead was he remixed Greek myths and made

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,460
them more palatable for a Roman audience

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:47,210
and with privacy there's only really one

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:53,060
little metal more to consider Iowan

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:56,240
Argos IO was a beautiful name this doing

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,660
was this does decided that he wanted to

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,220
have the geetam value she said no and

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,620
then there was a bit of a me to moment

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,530
and Zeus then decided he needed to cover

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,870
this up quite badly so he did that by

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,479
covering the entirety of the land in a

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,540
massive quite knows what happens when

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,970
any someone in authority decides to

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,240
cover things up someone notices and in

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,780
this case his wife Hera noticed and he

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,640
had form so she went one time to

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,800
investigate what was going on and she

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:37,270
went hey is this what you up to there

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,660
and what she saw was this standing there

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,449
would that carry because for an extra

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,500
bit of covering up he turned her are you

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:50,379
into a heifer

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:54,370
so heroin hey can I have the cat she's

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:56,110
ever so pretty and this went half the

00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,520
camp absolutely sand gift for you my

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:05,169
lovely wife and just looks off and she

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,819
went nice and being the victim blame her

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,919
that she was she decided to keep the

00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,740
coat but put it under constant

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,400
surveillance using a giant called Argus

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,830
Panoptix Argus cannot des was a massive

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,930
joint who was a shepherd ant hard a

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,479
hundred eyes covering the entirety of

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:26,590
his body all around his body which meant

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,750
he had 360 panoramic view and he never

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,819
really needed to go to sleep in order to

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,560
rest he only had to close two eyes at a

00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:37,990
time so pareo she's okay and she's under

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,349
constant surveillance after having been

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:52,840
violated so she got the word out to her

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:55,270
father a tiny tiny bit guilty thought oh

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,919
I should try and get her to the

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,830
captivity where she's being surveilled

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,500
constantly and so what he did was he

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,840
asked another god Hermes to sort it for

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,409
him and tell para means that it was he

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:13,120
did an exploit on Argos he came up in

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:15,880
disguise as a shepherd and told him big

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,750
long story which board Argos so much he

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,430
fell asleep

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:24,669
Hermes then killed it exploit done IO

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,830
was able to run away the Hera being like

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,759
so much of our society who likes victim

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,789
blaming whistleblowers and other people

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,710
me the gunfight Percy the carry all the

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,560
way to the banks of the River Nile

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,449
where are you fell over and then was

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,449
like restored to her natural form

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,050
so I've been talking about ignorant men

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,289
more exactly did of it the oven the

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,490
Roman poet bring to this thing what he

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:59,699
brought boys big ox

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:02,000
Hara being incredibly upset that her

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,949
tool of surveillance had been murdered

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,190
decided to memorialize him forever

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:11,340
by putting all of our Lisa's eyes on the

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:16,610
tail of a people so that was all birds

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:18,840
extra little finesse to the legend and

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,889
even though peacocks aren't actually a

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,919
Roman bird

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,419
he just thought it was a cool metaphor

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,960
but is this actually relevant to

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:31,740
nowadays well it is because if you're a

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,380
security firm Cece likes doing video

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,469
surveillance for companies what you do

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,020
is you call yourself Argus security I'm

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:44,219
Gia Bangor big eye right in the middle

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,060
of your company logo Argus pin Optus has

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,760
stayed within our public consciousness

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:56,630
with famous television reality shows

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:59,880
that explicitly reference that but I

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,459
mean how relevant is it nowadays well I

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,339
mean it's a great myth peacocks

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,990
aren't really that appropriate around

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,060
the world they can mean different things

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,180
to different religions so won't believe

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,850
that site will try something else

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,279
because the trouble is everybody focuses

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,190
on the technology they're not focusing

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,320
on the code we've forgotten to focus on

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,200
the person who's been surveilled against

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,459
the pure code

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,600
so we'll trade your adorable next we'll

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:32,610
try in 1984 now everybody remembers

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,610
about the telescreens

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,180
about in thought about the idea that

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,430
we've always been at war with Eastasia

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,440
but we're missing one of the main points

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,300
about the story because it's not just

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,190
about totalitarian regimes it's about a

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,320
philosophical exploding

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,710
have an idea from the 18th century by

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,110
force for a whole Gem event and what

00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:01,330
Jeremy Bentham designed was a panopticon

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:06,350
and it's a very simple idea you have

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:09,350
dome or building of cells all around a

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,940
central tower and within this tower you

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,770
have one individual and they have a

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,400
light that will shine on individual

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:19,340
cells no you have the apparatus of its

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,010
surveillance there but there's one

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,570
slight problem with that because we're

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,610
focusing on the technology we're not

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,200
focusing on what the idea was meant to

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,110
do

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:33,830
Bentham designed that panopticon with

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,720
the idea of controlling the human factor

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,700
he was around at the time of the

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,700
Industrial Revolution in the UK where

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,640
they were trying to mechanize industrial

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,830
procedure so you're when you're having

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,820
to control a large body of people being

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,400
factory workers the prisoners or rather

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,310
relevant now quarantine people within a

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,580
pandemic you want to maximize your

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:02,270
resources without overworking them and

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,370
then with the idea of the light being

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,650
shone into yourself is the little weird

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,570
of being surveilled you may not know

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,720
when or where you're being surveilled

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,490
and that's the idea because you know you

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,890
could be looked at at any point sometime

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,860
you don't know who's looking at you it

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,320
gets you to modify your behavior which

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,840
is explored quite deeply within the book

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,810
but it's very hard to focus on the

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,240
person being surveilled because Winston

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,280
Smith is part of that apparatus but he's

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:36,650
still a human being and he says dogs

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,940
ditchwater so it's relevant that we have

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,180
to think about other ways to explore

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,180
this idea

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,060
and horrible did not distance by popular

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,140
culture which she was like they brought

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:54,610
it also inspired the ietf he noticed

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,270
that there was a very important number

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,100
coming up in erotic seas and it came up

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,930
at a time when the US government we're

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,400
trying to do a trade in bottle barbar

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,690
own encryption and they were incredibly

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,560
worried they'd been worried about this

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:14,110
since the 60s the as the network of

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,320
information injury between consumers and

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,480
the government that there could be a

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:25,660
very real threat to the privacy of those

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:30,610
consumers and the u.s. were very much

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:33,310
trying to limit the creation of more

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:38,460
available but sources of encryption for

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:40,510
ways to do that and in 2015 rather

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,580
impressively given what happened with

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,460
Ron that yeah they decided to make it

00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,260
best current practice with the the

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,720
meeting show that they felt that people

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,580
had been using this RFC as best current

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:59,710
practice for years let's just make it

00:12:51,580 --> 00:13:02,050
official so the IETF and the internet

00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,580
architecture board were very concerned

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,100
about the need for increased protection

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,110
of international commercial transactions

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,940
on the Internet this was a burst of

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,620
e-commerce and the only ways that they

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,330
needed encryption in order for things

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,800
like credit card details not to leak

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:20,050
everywhere but the US government didn't

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,430
agree because they also knew that what

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,990
else happened on the internet that

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:28,120
perhaps needed encryption weren't

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:29,950
private messages between people so they

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,480
decided to go in a restricted area for a

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:37,630
start which meant us farm he was trying

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,580
to export encryption had to leave clues

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,710
for the client who were in Europe

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,330
through commentary through instructions

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,700
because

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,810
the encryption first and it needed to be

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,310
imported back in litter and the US

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,170
government were also trying to do things

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,760
like the corporate chip which was kind

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,000
of like a pin of the idea of a virtual

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,070
crocodile clips so that you could still

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,320
listen in conversations but in theory

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,850
the information was still encrypted so

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,450
the bad guys couldn't get out it just

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,130
the government could and sometimes they

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,470
just said oh I didn't even mean to make

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,220
the encryption that strong you don't

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:18,960
really and of course some regimes just

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,420
don't agree with encryption entirely so

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,400
why am I so worried about this why do

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,220
why do I think there's such a threat to

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,500
privacy well we have it at the moment

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,300
with various terrorist attacks people

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,430
trying to to plan out shenanigans and

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,740
governments want to know about that but

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,110
it's not just targeted to individual

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,730
organizations they wanted Dragonair for

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,430
everybody's information that they can

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:49,110
just search it for their convenience

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:51,600
Snowden has shown us this and there's a

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,310
heck of a lot of intelligence that can

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,230
be gathered from your communications

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,460
within Facebook what you put up there

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:01,830
what you react to when people post memes

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:05,610
and your friends and family they just

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:07,650
they're so curious about the idea of DNA

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,430
services and where do they come from and

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:13,200
are they are they really from Ireland

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,570
original is their family history says

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,820
and they don't understand they think of

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,620
it just as is a physical DNA test and

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,690
that will be stored somewhere they don't

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,280
realize it will be encoded and compared

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:28,260
later on and as I said the government is

00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,000
very very interested in knowing what

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:35,000
it's population is opting in 2015 North

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,430
UK promised err on the Australian

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,210
premiere didn't want encryption to be a

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:44,250
factor in communications the ye the

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,160
Australian premier in fact said that the

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,970
loss of mathematics were subject to the

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,110
laws of Australia

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:57,180
and both the UK and Australia had

00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:00,330
metadata bills which are designed to

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,600
force large a large broadband providers

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,089
to collect data that you give and the

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,250
data that's being collected are things

00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:10,560
like when you're connecting where you're

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,900
browsing to what are your IP addresses

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,339
these are all bits of information that

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,510
on their own don't seem that bad but

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:22,230
they tie in the profile you won of

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:25,380
course the u.s. from 2015 and on 2019

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,110
and 2020 are incredibly keen for

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:31,080
weakened encryption and back doors into

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,120
encryption so that we can have it easier

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,980
what they don't tell you though is that

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,480
there's a spectrum in terms of their

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,220
access a vice article found that

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,980
sometimes the police can very easily get

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:49,940
into your mobile devices they just want

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:52,890
it easier and the NSA has had access to

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,240
America's domestic communications for a

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,010
while and they're not meant to because

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,320
the NSA's remit is meant to be for

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:03,360
international not domestic and we have

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,550
things like the online harms bill in the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,780
UK and the owner ant which are designed

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,319
to try and protect the most vulnerable

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:13,020
in our society children from child

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,620
trafficking and child pornography but

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,500
these bills will not protect them what

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,660
they will do is threaten those

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,360
vulnerable children's privacy in the

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,189
first place because it means that

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,010
children as they grow up will not be

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:31,380
able to investigate parts of themselves

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:36,290
that they'd like to they will have

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:39,450
cradle to grave surveillance and

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,090
political parties want to know how they

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,670
can make you work for them now most of

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,290
us were pretty sturdy and what we

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,120
believe in what we hope you think a

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,340
party should be in what we should vote

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,840
for but you hang waters that in the

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,730
middle that are in the middle and can

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,440
swing from side to side and when

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,600
political parties are collecting your

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,300
data they're really collecting at

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,100
different

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,570
waters he can be manipulated and with us

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,270
being in the middle back endemic it

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,760
woman this is where the panopticon

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,160
really comes into place because

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,929
governments do need to have your details

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,290
need to have some way to track you in

00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,420
case you are infected with Kovac 90 the

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,550
difficulties is that we're giving them

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,200
all of these powers but we don't know

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:27,880
when we're going to get back the power

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,280
to not be surveilled and we have to

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,470
consider what happens once that data is

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,050
all gathered up is it going to be kept

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,120
safely is it going to be destroyed is it

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,830
right for the NHS in the UK going to be

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:44,559
sold on to pharmaceuticals and health

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:48,160
firms and our hospitals actually storing

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,770
that data properly because German

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,429
researchers found medical records on an

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,050
open file store online and that was

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:57,820
particularly about in Australia that

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:04,540
that is not meant to leave individual

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:09,570
states and of course political officials

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,570
can touch publicly sure to stores and

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,429
data from the Schengen information

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,650
system has ended up in u.s. hands

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:36,760
breaking GDP our own the Republican

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,490
National Convention

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,400
we're also briefly very careless with

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,220
motor data this demographic data

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,370
included the normal things like age and

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,820
we live and what demographic you are but

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,129
are all simply do things like

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,169
these subscriptions these are things

00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:56,179
that give you give political parties a

00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:59,769
really good insight into who their

00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:03,200
potential voters aren't and in a very

00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:05,090
1984's way the home office in the UK

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,669
destroyed the landing cards of the wind

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:11,269
report there by deleting any evidence

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:13,009
that members of the UK population who'd

00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:14,330
come over from the West Indies hunt

00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:19,549
prove that they're the right to stay in

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:21,559
the UK and not all of these bits of

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:26,529
individual data are being used by

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:29,450
commercial firms to help officers of a

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:33,559
government to track illegal immigrants

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:36,349
or to track anyone who's maybe just not

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,690
part of society yet who is considered

00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:42,049
she considered that they should be

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:45,590
thrown out or discriminated against in

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:48,019
some way and you definitely do not want

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,989
to trust you key officials on the

00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:53,210
Wikipedia article at my last check there

00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:54,649
were about thirty instances of new key

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,039
officials at all levels of government

00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:00,379
being plain careless with individuals

00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,359
data from a laptop being left in a taxi

00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:06,080
did someone handing in a thumb drive

00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:08,960
going to someone dropped this officials

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,929
are not trained to think about data in a

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,879
way that we think about data it doesn't

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:18,590
feel real enough to them so they don't

00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:21,619
cater and we'd have another threat with

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,389
CCTV s or where I'm this they've been

00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:26,269
around us for years we've grown up with

00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:29,239
them they're innocuous we don't notice

00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,799
them in restaurants we don't notice them

00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:31,249
really when they're out in the street

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,229
anymore

00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,700
we're told that they're just to stop

00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:37,279
crime minutes for a wrongdoing thorough

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,460
in safety and that's all very well but

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:44,119
we have a network of cameras that is

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:47,629
growing every year particularly with

00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,609
devices like Amazon ring which are being

00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:51,549
installed willy-nilly all over the place

00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:54,039
and ring has a very

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:58,539
Cosi partnership with law enforcement

00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:00,789
over 800 agencies in the US under

00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:03,070
getting very cozy with you key agencies

00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:05,019
as well and the way that we get Saul

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,090
Dennis the police can sell them on to

00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:09,159
customers who've been burgled burgled

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,309
and they go here you can have this at a

00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:15,129
discount and what's insidious is is that

00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:18,279
unless you explicitly opto not data that

00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:21,789
your doorbell collects will be shared

00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,769
with that police force or you can choose

00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:26,320
to just upload it to a neighborhood

00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:29,529
social network where everybody's

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,869
paranoid and sending in reports for

00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:34,440
innocuous things like someone delivering

00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:37,389
a package you're putting into

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,679
individuals hands the parrot event will

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,100
be judge and jury

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,419
when people have the power to do that

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,609
there are some very real consequences

00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:53,559
for those who are on the margins of

00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:57,429
society but one fear that I have is we

00:22:53,559 --> 00:23:00,190
have this network of CCTV cameras on

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,929
doorbells on the next logical place for

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,059
this to go is you've got a picture of

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,179
someone what can you do with that

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:09,460
picture I know we can make things

00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:12,220
frictionless for door entry we can do

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,109
facial recognition how happy does she

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,539
look that lovely white woman she's just

00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:20,980
so happy everything's just so much

00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:23,200
easier for her but there's a slight

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,409
problem with facial recognition and

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,679
certainly with a nineteen Parsons this

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:32,980
body's built into these systems in the

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:38,139
US the programming and the data sets are

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:40,539
mainly of white people so what is it

00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:42,129
means that the African American and

00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:45,730
other minority communities aren't

00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:47,619
identified properly by this system that

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,289
they've been Google and allegedly

00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:52,960
thought we can solve this let's go get

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:54,460
some third-party contractors according

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,609
to the third-party contractors they were

00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,249
told to build up the data set of

00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:02,680
minorities by any means possible so they

00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:04,360
did it to is they went to come

00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,160
the universities and got students to

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,380
play again with the got Starbucks card

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,930
and they did the same thing with the

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,420
homeless population as well when they

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,100
got card and they were allegedly told to

00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,930
focus on that homeless population

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:22,150
because they were less likely to ask

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:24,270
questions so there's a there's a there's

00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,290
a mismatch in thinking they're

00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,540
technologists are thinking about the

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,700
benefits of frictionless facial

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:35,590
recognition without thinking about the

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,840
consequences of this and government they

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,050
want facial recognition as well for MU

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,970
to be able to access public services and

00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:46,360
France the other Sam got launched in

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:49,150
October and you have to use an Android

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,250
phone to take a picture of yourself from

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,830
several angles so that the government

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,290
now has a biometric record of your face

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,050
and amazingly they wrote this out to

00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,030
French citizens not to people who are

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,780
third country nationals I honestly

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:20,830
thought they'd do it to them first

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:23,470
unskilled China is being tested on two

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,480
little toddlers in Japan to check if

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:29,410
they're engaged with the education

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,890
system the high school students that had

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:36,370
the system traveling in China AI was

00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:38,290
combined with facial recognition to send

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,260
a report home to parents if they're not

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,490
paying attention properly so students

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,200
aren't paying attention but they're

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,880
doing the appearance of paying attention

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,480
and they're not heard they're not

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:55,120
learning anything and facial recognition

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,070
will very soon be coming to others and

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,620
rim products because Amazon at the point

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,210
is developing recognition which it's

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,760
been a trying trilinos brick-and-mortar

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,340
stores for so you can have section was

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,899
shortly and it will be able to detect

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:15,249
you and what emotions if you're happier

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:16,990
isn't she so happy but yeah let's

00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:19,240
continue the discussion um about

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,929
biometric and DNA and at medical

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,610
information so DNA testing kits as I've

00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:28,419
mentioned earlier they're pretty

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:30,789
innocuous and baby Jayde March in the US

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:32,409
has a very cozy relationship with law

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,169
enforcement they've recently been bought

00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:37,149
by another company that's even closer in

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:40,539
with law enforcement they've never had a

00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:42,519
problem handing over a massive data set

00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,840
of DNA information to help law

00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,789
enforcement because they've always

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,590
believed that will help solve crime and

00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:51,419
it did solve a crime it solved the

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,639
Golden Gate murders in Los Angeles

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:59,200
because the perpetrators relative had

00:26:54,639 --> 00:27:03,369
uploaded that data can other DNA testing

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,409
services like 23andme and ancestry.com

00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,730
you still need a police warrant at the

00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:08,799
moment but I wouldn't feel too

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,409
complacent about that because 23andme

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,210
recently sold its daily data set to a

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:13,600
pharmaceutical company to develop more

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,970
drugs

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,590
now you can see with us lovely it's

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,539
helping people and it's like you've got

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,429
a president there you've just gone and

00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:24,669
sold our data set to a commercial

00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:27,549
company for Noah's from developing drugs

00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:32,200
we'd also could they sell that data know

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:36,399
that the precedent has been set and of

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,850
course with war and water of our

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,769
healthcare system becoming private

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:44,619
there's a concern about your own medical

00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:47,590
records were gathering so much data were

00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:50,049
digitizing so many medical records and

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:52,869
in theory of these are at least two

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:55,570
researchers the medical data is D

00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:58,330
anonymized but last month

00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:01,059
professor T from Melbourne University

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,820
got sacked because she made people aware

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:07,299
that the fact that the doctor for 2.5

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,299
million Australians going back to 1984

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:13,090
can possibly be the anonymized and the

00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:14,380
individuals can be identified by their

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:20,000
medical

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:22,130
and other bits of data and everybody

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,500
gets really excited about being able to

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,630
identify people by how they walk how

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,240
they express themselves and apprentice

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:31,039
and gates but these are things that you

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,240
cannot change about yourself or if you

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,909
didn't change something about yourself

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,740
suddenly you're gonna have some awkward

00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:41,480
conversations with the system when it

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:43,940
doesn't recognize you so bonnet sword

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,990
the collection of medical data putting

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:51,200
in your DNA data into these sites is

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,880
innocuous but once the data is up there

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,070
it's up there and that data can be

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,450
different combined with other data sets

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,970
and all of a sudden you grow medical

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,950
proof up and a DNA profile of an

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,940
individual but imagine what health

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:10,970
insurance companies can do with that

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:13,880
this is the modern panopticon this

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:16,220
semantic map that though will stowaways

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,289
bring there is you all these little data

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,269
points all the people that you're

00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:22,700
connected to and their data points you

00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:27,620
have a series of information and

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:31,130
profiling and pressure points how is

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,490
that water feeling so do we need privacy

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,940
your family's on it yeah they are on it

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:40,820
I'm the scholar esque and we've been

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,380
been as bad it's too late for us we have

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,519
to think about the next generation and

00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,590
the next generation after that teenagers

00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,809
don't care that's not true teenagers do

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,580
absolutely care they've been used to

00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,309
working rooms surveillance they've

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,139
performed a former stenography in order

00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:59,769
to code messages to their friends that

00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:02,419
their parents will recognize on with

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,519
tracking systems and facial recognition

00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:07,010
systems being rolled out across campuses

00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:09,620
in the US the students are starting to

00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:12,200
protest about it and organizations like

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:16,039
the Electronic Frontier and the

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,980
electronic freedom foundation are giving

00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:20,160
them tools

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,010
be able to do that see ya

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,840
they do care and we need to give up a

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,270
bit privacy for her security well I'm

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,790
gonna refer to her long dead American

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:33,179
president for that one because Dwight D

00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,350
Eisenhower was incredibly clear you said

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,970
that the ball Americans want his

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,130
security is they can just go off to

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,740
prison you know I'll have enough to me

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,450
go up a bed and roof over the head maybe

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,240
not in the u.s. tonight but if an

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,730
American wants to preserve his dignity

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,530
and his equality as a human being you

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,250
must not bowed his neck to any

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:56,280
dictatorial government and he's right

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:59,880
what to be volume or do we value being

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:02,280
in an optic cell or do we do we value

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,559
being able to hunger to space to

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,820
ourselves have a little bit of thinking

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,730
time to ourselves do we really want to

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:15,200
sacrifice our freedom and our personal

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,880
dignity because we're a bit scared

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,250
because I do not want the future to be

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,470
not not again I want free speech

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:27,540
I want free debate I don't want

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:30,210
censorship so is the hope that there is

00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,190
this hope the mainstream press are

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,710
starting to to wake up mainly because

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,520
journalists are starting to realize what

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,290
the consequences are and some cities in

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,780
the US and in other places are

00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:45,650
considering a moratorium on facial

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:49,290
recognition and you're all here

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:51,210
listening to this talk whether you're in

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,490
the room or you're doing this remotely

00:31:51,210 --> 00:32:00,799
or you're watching it later you care

00:31:53,490 --> 00:32:00,799
enough so what can we do well

00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:54,100
focused organizations only privacy

00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:57,370
international the electronic funding

00:32:54,100 --> 00:33:00,820
Frontier Foundation and certainly

00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:03,220
organizations like the ACLU providing

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:07,390
lots of material for you to understand

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:12,940
it downstairs for example there was the

00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:15,850
the glass dome stand which just

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,789
explained quite a bit about what your

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:22,600
routine can be like when you're doing

00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:25,450
things on length but like anything

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,000
you've got a bit of a job to do yourself

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,279
you've got to do your own data detox

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,080
you've got to consider all those ways

00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,570
you've been interacting with the virtual

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,890
world yourself it might be you've had a

00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,679
Google account for years

00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,820
and in order for you to be able to make

00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,340
they're not giving to your friends and

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,440
family you've can't go to half an idea

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,549
about how to debug or for yourself from

00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,230
what they're going to face as

00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:52,590
difficulties and if you want the world

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,350
to change help support existing

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:59,159
decentralized networks like Macedon like

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:02,350
diaspora look at the activity pub

00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,179
standard lick for applications that

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,230
provide

00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:07,230
real-world alternatives

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:14,480
and to some extent you can't just expect

00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:17,450
to point people a vigilant main - for

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,340
them to understand it might work for a

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,379
lot of people that everyone's an

00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:25,100
individual you want to think about ways

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:27,440
you can freeze personal stories shared

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,800
fondant movements in order to frame a

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,260
privacy argument you've got to try and

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,379
give some empathy to your friends your

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,270
family your chosen folk in order to get

00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,909
them to understand why this is a big

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,470
deal it's not enough to go and negotiate

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:44,780
with them not to put your stuff online

00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:49,520
you have to get them to care about what

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:51,560
they can't put online because you want

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,570
them to focus on the cow you want them

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,740
to realize that they are are you whether

00:34:53,570 --> 00:35:00,710
they realize it or not don't focus on

00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,359
the surveillance technology it's cool

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,850
and it's seductive and it's all about

00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,720
visuals and things but it's a lot harder

00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,340
to focus on people than it is on tech

00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:15,340
because I don't want the future to be

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:18,130
that panopticon think about simple

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,690
stories and ways you can freeze

00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,450
individual conversations about privacy

00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:25,550
you don't want to come up from your

00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,920
wrong Google's evil they're just swollen

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,560
up your data you've got to try and

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,750
freeze the thought acknowledge the use

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,670
that they've been using these tools for

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:39,500
years and help them find a way to do it

00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:42,080
use another tool for example I post a

00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,869
tooth post on Facebook I run the theme

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,790
of this talk the first one didn't get a

00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,320
lot of reaction on Facebook because it's

00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,930
clean though doesn't have a picture of

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,280
me and it doesn't really see much about

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:55,550
what I'm doing and it doesn't really

00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,270
bring empathy into the post the second

00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:01,520
post I acknowledged the tools like

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:05,060
Facebook and Twitter are community tools

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:09,260
people interact in their communities

00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,940
using these tools and people did watch

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,790
the video and they interacted with her

00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,830
on Facebook so there was a huge

00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:19,780
difference in

00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:21,100
take off with them and everybody's

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,290
sculptures different everybody has

00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,530
different myths and legends and family

00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:28,690
history to help people interact with the

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,790
subject matter this is a reason why

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:36,340
myths were developed in the first place

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:38,200
it was for social engineering and of

00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,000
course once you got your family and

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,070
friends on site there they're all on

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,050
board you can start contacting your

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,660
political representatives and start to

00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:51,160
push against the power of big data will

00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:54,640
be because political representatives

00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,930
often are not tech savvy either and

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,070
because you've been getting your friends

00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,320
and family to do this

00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,720
don't put even more pressure if you ask

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,400
them the right way and the more people

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,140
that put pressure on our political

00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,320
representatives to consider the people

00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:12,520
that they represent the more likely they

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,900
are the RT consider other sites in terms

00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,390
of the data to be in terms of privacy

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,930
because perhaps we can use that people

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:26,980
as a symbol perhaps we can use it for

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:30,670
the reason that a good thought we can

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:33,250
use those feathers to represent a

00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:35,980
moratorium on facial recognition on

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:41,350
being able to stop companies like Clear

00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:42,670
View scraping your data because human

00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,650
rights violations are happening right

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,280
now around us and it's only going to get

00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,880
worse as this pandemic continues and we

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,730
cannot normalize this data collection

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,680
this huge massive profile of each each

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,680
of us that is the virtual cannot again

00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:09,570
and use that hashtag the artists see was

00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:11,640
by the ITF that the point of RFC's are

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,700
to have a common framework of things

00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,480
like protocols and we need to consider a

00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,970
framework for how we handle data and

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,150
privacy and this could be one way to do

00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:26,330
it

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:29,480
this needs to be decentralized to use it

00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,480
