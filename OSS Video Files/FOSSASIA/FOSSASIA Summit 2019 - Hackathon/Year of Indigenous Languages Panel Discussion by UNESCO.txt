This panel discussion is convened by UNESCO under the umbrella of the United Nations 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. It will bring together indigenous young activists, specialists of languages and FOSS to raise awareness on the challenges affecting indigenous people in the region, in particular their languages, and to discuss the importance of technology and FOSS for preserving and developing indigenous languages.

It is our goal to engage the developer community to develop innovative applications as open source by leveraging open data and knowledge-sharing. With the hackathon we support the dissemination of good practices with regard to indigenous languages and increase access to multilingual information and knowledge.

"Languages play a crucial role in the daily lives of people, not only as a tool for communication, education, social integration and development, but also as a repository for each person's unique identity, cultural history, traditions and memory. But despite their immense value, languages around the world continue to disappear at an alarming rate. With this in mind, the United Nations declared 2019 The Year of Indigenous Languages (IY2019) in order to raise awareness of them, not only to benefit the people who speak these languages, but also for others to appreciate the important contribution they make to our world's rich cultural diversity."
