Title: Year of Indigenous Languages Panel Discussion by UNESCO
Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Hackathon
Description: 
	15 March 2019 13:00, Event Hall 2-2 (Hack Stage)

In the panel: Davide Storti, Mathura Bikash Tripura, Misako Ito, Oranee Jariyapotngam, Dorn Bouttasing

This panel discussion is convened by UNESCO under the umbrella of the United Nations 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. It will bring together indigenous young activists, specialists of languages and FOSS to raise awareness on the challenges affecting indigenous people in the region, in particular their languages, and to discuss the importance of technology and FOSS for preserving and developing indigenous languages.

It is our goal to engage the developer community to develop innovative applications as open source by leveraging open data and knowledge-sharing. With the hackathon we support the dissemination of good practices with regard to indigenous languages and increase access to multilingual information and knowledge.

"Languages play a crucial role in the daily lives of people, not only as a tool for communication, education, social integration and development, but also as a repository for each person's unique identity, cultural history, traditions and memory. But despite their immense value, languages around the world continue to disappear at an alarming rate. With this in mind, the United Nations declared 2019 The Year of Indigenous Languages (IY2019) in order to raise awareness of them, not only to benefit the people who speak these languages, but also for others to appreciate the important contribution they make to our world's rich cultural diversity."

applause for miss aku and all the

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,660
panelists thank you thank you Mario for

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,880
hosting this panel on indigenous

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,440
languages which is quite an original

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,309
topic for force Asia and thank you also

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,570
for joining this panel discussion

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:51,059
despite that it's a lunch time break but

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,250
we try to make it very interesting and

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,190
because we are a small group please feel

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,219
free to intervene and ask question and

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,070
engage in the discussions because you

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,760
know it's not a big audience so just to

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:11,510
give you some figures that UNESCO has we

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:15,030
have around 6700 spoken languages today

00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:19,530
but we estimate that half of them are

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,119
endangered and we have an estimate that

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,850
every two weeks

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,340
one languages disappears and when one

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,470
language disappear it goes with the

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,960
culture identity all the perception of

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,390
the world that is related to those

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,759
languages which disappear from the world

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,659
and from the cultural diversity of the

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,280
world so this is a real concern from

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,130
UNESCO which is the governmental

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,070
organizations we are championing in the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,399
area of cultural diversity and try to

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:00,270
protect the world cultural diversity

00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:03,600
worldwide and we also estimate that 90%

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,540
of the world languages spoken today

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,200
could not continue to exist until the

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,510
end of 21st century and most of them the

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,290
majority of those languages are in

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,920
genus languages so the panel discussion

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,610
here and we have eminent speaker from

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,260
both indigenous community but also

00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,439
technology free and open source software

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,909
but also language expert so the panel

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,440
discussion here is to discuss how

00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:37,860
technology and especially the free and

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,500
open source software can help to

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,909
preserve those languages and also to

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,730
revitalize some of them so maybe I can

00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:50,099

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:33,930
complex the scripting languages okay

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,180
thank you so maybe I can start one with

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,840
one questions about the challenges that

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,860
you know indigenous people are facing in

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:50,240
this region and in the country who wants

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,240
to pick pick up the questions first yes

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:59,420
the challenge from my point of view in

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:03,270
the Mekong really in the Mekong region

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:08,450
the relocation of the indigenous from

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:12,090
the homeland to different area and

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,030
because the development project offered

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,180
a place in the area of where the

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:22,230
indigenous people live and for the

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,110
indigenous in Laos for example with the

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,740
project come to the area then they have

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,260
to relocate some is relocated by

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,330
themself but some are forced relocated

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:39,480
so that is a one challenge and that

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,700
affected to culture language and art

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,450
lost in the community and also about

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,750
climate change

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:53,780
so here the climate change is also about

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:59,270
food security and also society change

00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:03,510
this is a happen or not allows so in my

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,850
for the language lost I want to share

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,890
with you about example when I was a

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:16,320
child so when I speak my own language in

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:19,050
maturity society and we feel shy I feel

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,750
shy because the majority they will laugh

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:26,220
when I speak my own language and then

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:29,850
they make fun of us so yeah and then we

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,280
we try but you know we are small

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,940
people's no ethnic group with the big

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,080
groups of people so it's like some more

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:42,810
water cannot stop fire so we feel often

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,700
like when we go to a market like two

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,650
people go to cattle and then when we

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,080
talk our own language talking our own

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,200
language people will just forget us like

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,070
ah look at her make fun of us and we

00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:01,080
feel like we are crowd in in a big

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:04,920
society because my parents my

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:08,070
grandparents also have been relocated

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,700
for three times because of how can I say

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,640
because of the development project so we

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,790
have to move from one place to another

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,050
place to joy of it different in a group

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:25,470
to become bigger village so that is in

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,300
one policy in our country some more

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,510
village helped with your small village

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,260
to become a bigger village and often the

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:38,550
indigenous people will put will put with

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:41,550
the majority in Laos and that's how we

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,730
lost our language our culture and the

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:49,200
art and many of us we could not remember

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:52,080
like the history of our people the

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,620
history of our ancestor the footprint we

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,800
could not fight so yeah so you don't

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,550
have any support from apart from your

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,290
close family and maybe community to

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,280
continue to use the languages you don't

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:12,570
have any support from the government to

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,440
continue to use that's languages so in

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,830
Laos every ethnic group allow people and

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,540
we are not allowed to be indigenous so

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:27,300
loud we are not recognized at as

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:30,060
indigenous people so we allow and for us

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,169
it's very difficult to preserve our

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:37,919
language and because we are not allowed

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:41,729
to set up a learning center focus on

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,640
indigenous language so if we cannot do

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,030
that and it will be difficult for

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,040
- like gathering with juice to learn the

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,610
own language and the culture that we

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,250
have

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:57,320
so the supporting now is like indigenous

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,080
Jews are together like green house

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,320
community where I work is we try to

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,050
gather many youth and we try to

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,660
brainstorm what the language that you

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,780
can remember what our culture that you

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,560
can recognize we do like that and this

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:19,070
is like the first type of activity yeah

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,350
but from government we don't we don't

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,300
have yet like if you want to set up a

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,340
Learning Center it will be very

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,030
difficult and they not allowed to do

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,520
that thank you

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,070
yes I mean do you have also the similar

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,350
challenges in Cambodia I just would like

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,650
to add from my friend from laughs

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,540
actually if you look at the economic

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:45,320
grow in the Mekong region there is many

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:48,710
big investment project like mining

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:52,310
hydropower dam economic plan congestion

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,140
all this project is very have big impact

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,600
to the indigenous community because most

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,830
a project I come to the remote area

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,320
especially in the indigenous territory

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:06,500
if you look at the indigenous language

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,020
challenges at the current situation most

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,240
of the young people they could not speak

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,020
the indigenous language wells especially

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,270
in Cambodia we have 24 indigenous people

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:23,150
indigenous groups and we have different

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:25,250
languages and there are about 617

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,100
indigenous they can speak their language

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,330
but the other day almost lost their

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,070
language they cannot speak their

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,340
language this is also the big concern

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:39,710
and for see our aim in cambodia latina -

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:43,880
association i working try to conserve

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:46,460
you know like preserve or like restore

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,680
how we can make their language alive

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,260
because it is a part of our identities

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,370
which is physically in the national and

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,569
international laws and

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:04,689
of course right now if you look at the

00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:08,050
elder also elder not have time to to

00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:10,980
teach or to to gather together the

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,259
people to to train how they can to

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,480
maintain the identity and I didn't at

00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:20,230
their language as well also like some

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,259
used when they study at school for

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,769
example in Cambodia from grade one to

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,360
grade three if the teacher who come to

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:32,339
teach the student in the village they

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,660
have to speak in this language eighty or

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,879
eighty-five percent they have to speak

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,920
in indigenous language and then when

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,370
they start from great for to great sick

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:46,449
they have to speak my language from

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,329
eighty to eighty-five percent and then

00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:50,740
when in each the students that great

00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:53,410
seven week in the secondary school or

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,540
Kota can speak full in Khmer and also

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,240
they have to learn English so it very

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,459
hard for them to you know to catch up

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,029
you know the some session that provide

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,029
by teacher

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:06,009
this is also one one the challenge also

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,850
when they call continue to study at the

00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,829
University

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,540
most of the subject and most of the

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,819
communication they have to speak it in

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,459
command and also like in English so this

00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,079
is the one thing that we lost how we

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,850
lost our language we lost our

00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,339
communication this kind of the big

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,740
concern I think is this time is good

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,720
that UNESCO come up with is even and try

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,730
to rest that concern I hope the

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,059
government and other partner who are

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,779
working on indigenous area they have to

00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:37,389
very concern and concentrate and try to

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,019
to work together how to preserve and

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:43,029
maintain our identity and our language

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,519
for the sustainable development in the

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,470
in the country and also in the

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,579
international yes just my idea I think

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:54,879
thank you thank you for contributing so

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:57,100
indigenous languages are written but you

00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,379
know according to your perspective why

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,689
you think it's so important to protect

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:04,500
those languages you know they have lot

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:08,070
of people asking you know whether

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,790
is better to focus on national languages

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,770
too you know as a mean of communication

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,710
economic growth for the country why is

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,670
it so important to protect the engineers

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:22,830
languages despite the you know de

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,160
localizations and lot of challenges does

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:30,510
the indigenous people are facing you

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,490
want to yes thank you thank you first of

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,520
all actually I had to sum one of the big

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,270
challenges for the English languages

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,850
especially in the so called

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,520
nation-states the existence of

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,480
indigenous peoples are not that must be

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,880
cognized if I mention upon my country's

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,060
constitution according to the

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,850
Constitution only then bangla the

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,340
mainstream language is the official

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,050
language in our country no other

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,770
languages are recognized by the

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,580
Constitution only in the recent

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,240
amendment

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:12,470
there is one clause included on the

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,200
cultural promotion of dangerous peoples

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:20,010
no other things like the rights of the

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:23,040
users peoples - on their land and other

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,340
heritage things so these are also very

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:32,460
much a big challenge for the indigenous

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:34,140
peoples to - to improve their this

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:38,750
education system and many other things

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:41,370
related to the language and culture so

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,160
there is also one thing like the

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,130
policies there are many policies in

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,590
Bangladesh in some policies like the

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:53,480
national education policy in that policy

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,600
indigenous language is somehow

00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,840
recognized but in during the

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,190
implementation there are some some sort

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:08,630
of dilemma and some sort of sort of the

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:11,880
bureaucratic system which is somehow

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,910
blocking the smooth implementation of

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,990
these policies so these are also very

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,510
most important

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,820
so if we want to welcome all these

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:25,830
things actually we have to make the

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:28,650
government fast motivated to really

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,080
implement rights of dangerous people

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:35,690
send their languages and cultures so

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,650
there is very much important and we also

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,160
need to strengthen the polity of

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:45,090
commitments because of the as disease

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,220
and many other international mechanisms

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:51,720
the government they pretend to be very

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,660
much positive to the to the rights of

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,840
the indigenous peoples and other

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,910
minority groups in their countries but

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,120
in the implementation well these are not

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,940
actually that much effective so in our

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,070
country the government is has started

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:14,310
the education in indigenous languages

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:17,760
since since 2017 but still there are

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:21,540
many other issues the they have

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,240
developed materials education materials

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,970
it is distributed in the fields but the

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,280
teachers are not teaching the materials

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,840
are not in used so what is the use of

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:37,130
this type of activities so that teachers

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:39,600
should be trained how to deliver the

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:43,170
education system in their own languages

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,200
and also there are also some shortages

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:50,130
of teachers in the fields that teachers

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,650
are not allocated not not not posted to

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,130
the to the same speaking languages

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,890
language areas so if the teachers are

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,010
not located in the same language

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:04,110
speaking areas so the students are

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,970
actually not getting education in their

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:12,690
own language so it is also important so

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:14,610
another thing is like what I think is we

00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:19,589
have to show the government that they

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:21,839
have benefits if they implement the the

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,120
right job indigenous indigenous peoples

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,890
and their languages because if we want

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,380
to if we want to achieve as disease

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,310
the goals the government if the

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,260
government wants to do that they have to

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,870
they have to address the issue civilians

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,250
people's without addressing the issue so

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,120
various people's it is not possible

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:54,020
because the SDC itself says that no one

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:56,790
shall be behind thank you so as DG is

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,160
sustainable development goals I don't

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:02,610
know if you heard about that it's a set

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,610
of 70 goals that were adopted by the

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:10,830
United Nations General Assembly to

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:14,280
pusher for the next until 2030 so and

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:17,310
there is a very big slogan that says in

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,880
no one left behind which is the the key

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:23,940
principle for the attainment of

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:28,350
sustainable development goals so you you

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,420
you mentioned that languages is you

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,210
mentioned that indigenous right to

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:37,770
languages so is it something that is

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:42,390
recognized internationally is there any

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:45,120
instrument that's all yes we have many

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,430
international instruments like the und

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,560
our IP business United Nations

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,370
declaration on the rights of indigenous

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,890
peoples

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,990
so there is a very strong instrument for

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,510
the indigenous peoples to claim their

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:03,530
rights and there are also others like

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:05,760
the ILO 1:07 about the rights of

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:11,730
education in their own language up to a

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:16,260
primary level and similarly the SDG does

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:20,490
sustainable devils for itself saying

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,860
that it is like inclusive education so

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,900
if we want to make it inclusive really

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:31,080
inclusive we have to include engines

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:33,410
peoples so maybe now we can move on on

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,630
the questions about you so how

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,790
technology can really help to revitalize

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:42,090
those languages and all

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:45,600
so create some resources to develop

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,790
those languages already do you want to

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,280
comment on that

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:55,010
okay maybe I will start with my my

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,940
opinions what what what I word is about

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,400
multilingual education and then we

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,430
provide based on merit on mother tongues

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,680
and then we we have a lot of teaching

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,140
material like this

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,200
this is this is we call big book now and

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,250
then we have a picture story and oh we

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:17,340
have a lot of thing and I think that um

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:20,160
nowaday in just indigenous people even

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:24,480
me you know when I when I when I grow up

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,420
and I live in was in University I'm not

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
recognized I'm not I'm not proud of

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,200
myself

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,090
I mean I'm not proud I am Karen I mean

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,340
I'm belong to current indigenous and

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,990
then I'm not proud of myself and then

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,420
when I am do that when I finished

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:42,030
University and then I mean I'm joined in

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,910
this program I feel like this would be

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,490
very nice to we can learn both you know

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,640
we through this through this program

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,420
they can learn their own language and at

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,530
the same time

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:58,790
after that they can breach it to tie-tie

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:01,950
opposite high national language and also

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:07,170
excalibur language it would be very nice

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:10,470
for them and also for us I mean how can

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:13,800
we have indigenous people recognized

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:17,160
about this we have to to show them what

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,200
is the benefit if we if we even if I

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,270
talk to you you have to you have to you

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,070
know preserve your language you have to

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,140
do you have to speak your language maybe

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,900
you know a lot of indigenous people they

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,510
are not they are not agree with us but

00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,850
if we say like you know if you want to

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,290
be good in pacify in Thailand if you

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,590
want to be good in pasa

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,930
English you to start I mean start with

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,300
your language and then it will be

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:47,250
something linked to your you know in

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,890
another languages I what you say I want

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,330
to ask how technology right technology

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,230
can be like

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:59,039
a big resource now for us to to to

00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:03,659
collect those natural things I mean all

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:06,059
we can do like a teacher training like

00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,980
learning things to train the teacher to

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,989
help the children to to learn their own

00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:14,159
language or we can do like a dictionary

00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:16,860
in our own language we can do even to

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,399
raise awareness we can provide a video

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:23,100
saying what bolster or whatever yes this

00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:26,519
is not so for example for the Cameron

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:29,159
languages do you have I mean do you have

00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:32,549
computer software that's in these

00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:35,549
languages do you have written scripts do

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:38,639
you have lot of resources online can we

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:42,179
publish a website in this Cameron

00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:44,190
languages oh yes in Thailand we have 74

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:49,379
language now current is the big group

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:54,029
and then I am Not sure that is that is I

00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:56,220
think maybe some of the application is

00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,989
related with our in current I think we

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,739
already have it but in another language

00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:03,749
a small language that is easy to appear

00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:08,789
with then we don't I think we don't have

00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:12,659
it yet so maybe I cannot tell exactly

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:13,499
what what application but maybe yeah you

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,929
mentioned that

00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:18,779
mother tongue base multilingual

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,700
education right that people need to

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,639
master the mother tongue the Karen

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,279
languages before starting to learn Thai

00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:28,769
national languages or international

00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,899
languages which is English do you think

00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:33,929
the lack of resources the lack of

00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:38,399
technology in current languages is could

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:40,830
be a barrier for people to you know to

00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:44,460
master fully these languages and to move

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:49,109
on other languages or or the current

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:52,019
state is I mean is good enough I think

00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:54,899
is good for indigenous language because

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:58,169
we can provide a place I mean the place

00:23:54,899 --> 00:24:00,020
that they can reach to the information

00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,670
they can reach to the

00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:10,010
that the resolve in our own language

00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:12,050
okay you have been working for you know

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,990
free and open source software so you

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:17,990
know the spirit of you know

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,940
collaborations and how innovative ideas

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,600
can be developed through collaborations

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,730
do you think the force community and you

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,960
know free and open source software can

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:47,890
help in this area where do you think you

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:52,910
know areas of actions point technology

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:54,350
has to be the role of facilitator so for

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:59,900
addressing many of the issues that you

00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:02,240
just raised technology is I mean many

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:10,429
many things we do everyday technology of

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:14,900
this role so it's also open source play

00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:20,120
a role and also because you know let's

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,320
say working on the programming we hear

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,570
this phrase that you know the

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,610
programming language of programming is

00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,059
English because of many programming

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:33,050
languages some brief reference to some

00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:36,320
English words but that's wrong in many

00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,450
ways also for programming but it's about

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,040
the concept that what is behind the

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,770
language the language is something that

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,780
it's the dare to express something right

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:52,420
so that's the point so if we're not able

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:55,820
to express on in our own language that's

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:59,840
what we're saying here so it's a problem

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:02,660
so technology is a way to help the

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,470
expression of people and this is why I

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:10,130
think it's important too that the

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:13,059
community I mean technology be more

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:15,590
aware and that the community is also

00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:16,820
open-source it's a big global community

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,679
because we are not talking about a few

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,690
people and click the technology

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:25,000
companies that took a few years to

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:28,160
actually realize that this is reality

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,940
because when you talk about big big

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,220
companies they you know the objective is

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,260
to of course make business and when you

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,530
try to invest for making a business you

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,470
invest on the on the mass so we develop

00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:45,410
products for the most people they can

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:47,840
actually use or buy the services of the

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,120
product and when it comes to minorities

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,000
that's of course a problem because you

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,360
are not very keen to invest effort

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,070
sometimes and you know all the resources

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,830
in in developing something which is

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,080
going to be used by very few people but

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,580
actually that's also not true I mean the

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,510
international ear is an opportunity also

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:12,049
to say that this indigenous communities

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:18,590
represent almost 400 million people

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:21,590
around the world and and this is totally

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:25,400
I'm reading here it is an amount of more

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,870
than 2,600 languages that are considered

00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,120
to be indigenous

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,830
so of course within this language there

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,960
are two languages are used very very few

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:38,690
people and this comes to the language in

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:40,100
danger and there's been there with some

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,740
processes unit has been for example

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,840
approving some normative instrument that

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,600
are trying to push the industry also to

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,600
move towards the support of indigenous

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:57,520
languages like the recommendation on the

00:27:50,600 --> 00:28:02,929
languages in cyberspace which was right

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,820
and this is one way where you know it's

00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,760
an attempt to sensitize and to try to

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,280
move the decision makers to were

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,380
supporting this kind of action from the

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,960
from the theory to the reality of

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,990
courses in different

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,130
you know story and then when it comes to

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,860
technology it is of course about

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:31,430
standards it is about open standards

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:33,880
mainly so the about the Unicode of

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:37,850
course which is a giant step into the

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:42,470
making it possible to support complex

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:45,800
languages but that's something that has

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:49,100
to be sustained and you know unicode is

00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,380
a very heavy long process and there

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,590
again it's up to the community also to

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:57,560
come up with solutions to propose it's

00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:00,470
about making typefaces you know fonts

00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:05,320
for and so we have to be able to design

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:10,250
open fonts to be able to design open

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:15,200
input you know tools because not

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:17,990
languages are not you cannot input

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,470
things in the same way for all languages

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:24,470
so you need to have you know different

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:27,050
input methods which may not exist and

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:29,300
then it goes to the rendering of course

00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:32,500
of the language because it's no point in

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:36,830
having something that you cannot then

00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,710
display or print and you know these are

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:43,490
all the little things that actually are

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:46,790
making it possible or impossible for

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:49,120
people to use their own language in

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,120
education

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,120
in news and also to tell the story about

00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:58,809
the language because now some languages

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,750
will disappear history is full of you

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:04,150
know things change of course at the same

00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,660
time we also there is also need for us

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:10,240
as a humanity to you know tell the story

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,419
what what was there what is what is

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,690
there today and you cannot do it without

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:20,530
this kind of of tools so yes open-source

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:25,900
community can actually work in many ways

00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:27,250
in supporting this effort and and this

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,110
is also one of the reason of this

00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,799
akhaten today I think it's really to

00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:35,130
sensitize the young developers

00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:38,830
developers that actually this is not a

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:42,250
fight to be taken and this is a very

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:47,010
good example where you know open source

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,010
of spontaneous maker

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,799
thank you David I think yeah you really

00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,480
mentioned a very important point as you

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,270
know the International Year of

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,640
indigenous languages is an opportunity

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,880
to remind us that the indigenous

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,480
languages are not dead languages they

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,299
are the languages that are spoken by

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,450
almost 400 millions populations in the

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:19,870
world and you know more than 70 80

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:24,000
countries so it's very very important

00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:29,679
for us to protect and maybe is there any

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,770
comments or from the audience that you

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:37,360
want to all questions that you want to

00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:40,290
raise do you have any ideas of how you

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:46,679
know you as active member of open-source

00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:46,679
community can contribute in this area

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:56,400
with AI or yes all the technologies yes

00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:15,690
yeah so my question is actually - well

00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:19,170
the primarily represent of people

00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:22,290
speaking minority languages because I

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,570
was wondering if there is any shall we

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,850
say resistance from within the

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,370
communities themselves and the reason

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:31,320
why I'm asking is because I mean my

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,800
language is not that small it's not

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,500
endangered but I didn't even realize

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,600
myself the importance of my language

00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,990
until I actually moved abroad and

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,610
started using primarily English when I

00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:49,020
realized that only if I were to only

00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,730
express myself in English I would be

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,360
very very limited there are many

00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:57,090
experiences I cannot express in English

00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,510
not because you know so I was wondering

00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:02,370
and but before I did that and I have

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:06,360
many friends especially printers who

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:08,340
work in technology that insists that my

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,110
language is Swedish by the way so they

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,750
insist that Swedish this is not

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,250
important in technology all the

00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,140
documentation is available in English

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,520
all the information we need is on the

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,929
English Wikipedia we don't need the

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,540
Swedish Wikipedia which happens to be

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:24,270
the number two we get busy in the world

00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:27,080
actually but which is which is

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:31,170
interesting right so you have very large

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,240
the language is used a lot and and and

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:35,850
clearly a lot of people edit Wikipedia

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,760
in my language but still especially with

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,950
the intech it's completely dismissed by

00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,870
a lot of people it most of the

00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,920
technology people I work with wouldn't

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:49,170
even hear about using setting their

00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,360
leaders desktop to Swedish or reading

00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,550
the Swedish version of documentation etc

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,640
etc and and this is within the language

00:33:53,550 --> 00:34:01,200
that is rather big so I'm thinking

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,730
within the small the indigenous language

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,130
within the indigenous languages there

00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,929
must be I'm imagining that there's a lot

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,540
of internal resistance people saying

00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,730
okay fine it's my language but they're

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,379
so

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,950
few people speaking it and I need to

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:18,129
speak Thai or or whatever language to

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,470
make myself understood why why should we

00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:22,629
keep doing this right I can understand

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:24,550
why people outside the community would

00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:26,350
would discard the language but I'm

00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,659
thinking that it probably happens within

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:36,730
the communities themselves so I'd like

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:40,960
to have a comment on that if possible I

00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:46,090
want to share about the mic more

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:49,419
indigenous allows I think very important

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:54,159
for us as indigenous to know our own

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:55,840
language because we have rich history in

00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,250
the country that's why they call

00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:03,130
ourselves indigenious so for us because

00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,320
we are living in the community because

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:08,080
we are living in the country that our

00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,300
language they're recognized and at the

00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,100
same time the language disappearing

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,740
because of our any group or the majority

00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,200
so for us to know our old language is

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,570
very important because when we speak to

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,260
our parents we still use our language

00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,590
and we are shy to speak in different

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:33,130
language without parents without

00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:36,250
families we feel shame because then we

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:40,090
was born our parents always keep talking

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:43,180
and telling story about a footprint the

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:47,950
footprint of our ancestor and the

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:50,890
culture that can color our group we feel

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:53,140
so proud because our culture the

00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:57,340
language so unique in the country how to

00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:00,310
say and for us if we don't have the

00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:04,480
language if the culture disappear

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:07,359
we feel nothing like in Laos for example

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,600
take many ethnic group especially the

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,030
majority majority they call ourselves

00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,190
the alcohol but they don't call our

00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,280
group they call us

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,500
Lao pang now Kang it means you look down

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,380
on us now Kang it means you are in the

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,990
middle you have no

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,750
to stay you don't have your own culture

00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,670
you don't know your own language this is

00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:33,240
how we feel when they call as Lao pang

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:37,140
and also many people were called as Chi

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:40,950
Chi is like slave but in the history

00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:44,430
very very hear from our parents our

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,530
history so big you know our culture are

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,670
so rich and we can feel that we can

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:52,890
touch that and we can listen that from

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,740
from our parents so that is so beautiful

00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:59,880
but when we hear it from different

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:03,240
ethnic group it's so different why they

00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,540
describe us that way we also don't

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,480
understand and also if you want to do

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:13,380
like research on history of indigenous

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,890
people you have to submit a letter like

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,980
a permission to do the research and

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:21,390
before you can publish your research you

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,290
need to ask permission from the

00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:28,440
government so before you submit I mean

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:31,440
when you submit the research and the

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,690
government will first skin all the

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,340
information and they will allow you to

00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:39,870
publish which part of it so here the

00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,900
culture and the history of our

00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:45,600
indigenous is still hidden and there are

00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,790
some so many things that we should bring

00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,470
out I think to preserve the language

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:55,770
also back to that session once the the

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,980
language alive the culture will come

00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,790
back at the history will present itself

00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:04,340
this what we believe

00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:08,820
Thanks thank you down yes already okay

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:11,700
from educational expect if the children

00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,730
who are know much more than one

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,670
languages they will be more much better

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,070
in their learning so if they start with

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,710
the language that their family with the

00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,900
thing that they are very close to maybe

00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,610
they can express what you know at the

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,880
same time they can develop the idea

00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,840
their thinking so it is more it's much

00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,810
better

00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:38,520
in modern multilingual mm-hmm yeah it is

00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:41,430
really good that you express about that

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,320
light today also my cell now it had for

00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,570
me how I can express all the things that

00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,840
I concern in English this is also the

00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:54,390
one thing it reality of course I think

00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:57,750
in order to to make sure that all the

00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:00,600
thing is regular languages can still

00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:03,360
alive it's not just only indigenous our

00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,040
selves have to enroll in protecting but

00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,930
also the other people also have to be

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,990
enrolled and also learning our language

00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,760
and also not just focus on their their

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,060
own voice and part line now every way

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,730
they speak English and some sometimes we

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:21,960
cannot express all all all all thing

00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,820
that we have in mind so I think for my

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,700
people in Cambodia especially there we

00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,890
have 24 like I mentioned early all of

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,630
them some some lights event indigenous

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,280
group they already lost because they're

00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,460
not encouragement from the government

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,560
and also not like do the research and

00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,190
documentation about the issue of the

00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,410
language barrier that they use in the in

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:47,630
their group and also in the policy you

00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:50,370
know they still kept also like know like

00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,440
well document and also lie right in like

00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:55,770
in in my language the funan people we

00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,870
have like writen in like Latin but it is

00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,820
not recognized from government and then

00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:02,220
the government they work with UNESCO and

00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,550
add an organization they they recognize

00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:08,610
they incorrectly to use like my writing

00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:14,160
it had for us to adapt to use that kind

00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:18,210
of a letter letter or writen and also

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,670
they try to collaborate or integrate in

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,100
the technology it easy for us to rise

00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,780
and some some people not all they can

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,720
use that kind of system it still need

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,640
more capacity building and awareness

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,730
racing to the local people how it will

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,480
be benefit for the new generation to use

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:39,360
that kind of technology to bring their

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:41,580
you know the their spirit especially

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,530
that they identity and their culture in

00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:47,850
terms of Education and

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,980
anything that related to into society

00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:58,050
development something like that yeah

00:40:49,980 --> 00:41:01,050
just something about I mean we speaking

00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:03,600
about languages which are written also

00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:06,690
but there are also oral languages that

00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,070
are not written and there's some

00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,630
feedback that we had from some

00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,190
indigenous communities yet they don't

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,980
want these languages to be written

00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:16,770
actually so so that's also another

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,400
challenge how can we provide tools for

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:25,369
these languages to to continue and to

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,780
and to be accessible to the

00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:31,850
technologically Internet today without

00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:35,090
being really written languages so that's

00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:38,040
because the written form doesn't exist

00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,680
and unless the community really wants to

00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,000
do it that's not up to as I believe to

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:49,290
decide for for them so how do you manage

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,830
to read bridge this huge gap it's also

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:56,580
something that could be addressed I have

00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:58,490
just one example on the perception of

00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:02,490
images people some their own languages

00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:07,170
actually these issues of market value

00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:10,680
you know when we started in 2006 we have

00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:14,130
started the language multilingual

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:18,830
education activities in our areas with

00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:21,630
three major languages that time actually

00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:24,420
some of the parents when we started

00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,770
working on this they used to always they

00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,770
used to raise the question that whether

00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:30,720
our children will get job learning in

00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,330
their own languages so that is very much

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:38,609
important so now actually they're

00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:40,820
realizing and also we are trying to make

00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:43,520
all men understand about the issue and

00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:48,570
recently the government is thinking to

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:52,960
to to put sort of precondition for the

00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:57,610
teachers to be a teacher they must have

00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,010
knowledge on their own languages they

00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:03,070
must they must be able to read and write

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,190
their in their own languages so after

00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:10,810
that actually now what we are seeing

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:14,350
just last one two years our indigenous

00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:16,270
youth they're starting to learn their

00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,700
own languages before they didn't know

00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,740
how to write and read their languages so

00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:24,190
now they're starting and even some

00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,110
youths they are arranging the training

00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:30,190
how to read and write in their own

00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:33,690
languages putting their own money from

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:36,960
own pockets so this is a great I think

00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:41,800
progress of the resource peoples

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,750
languages in in Bangladesh yeah yeah so

00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,560
we are running out of time so just to

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:49,240
summarize the debate I think for for for

00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,030
all of us you know one of the biggest

00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,520
challenges of indigenous languages is

00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:57,700
the fact that it's the languages that is

00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,760
transmitted to the next generations only

00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:03,010
through the goodwill of those

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,370
communities who continue to speak those

00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,680
languages and there is no support from

00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:12,700
the system around there is no support

00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,760
from education from media from you know

00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:18,130
even the lack of written script so this

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,610
is the I guess the biggest challenges

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:25,450
and so we have a hackathon that will

00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:29,770
start we know in one hour but before

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:32,350
moving to that would you be possible to

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:35,230
say I find a word about you know what

00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:38,370
would be your expectation out of this

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:44,250
hackathon and this collaboration with

00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:49,960
the first community on this topic yes

00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:52,240
yes for my expectation I hope this way

00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,660
today it will be reached in the world

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,430
and also like all indigenous people who

00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,440
still remain and practice their culture

00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,690
as they continue to speak their language

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,580
and also we need to call all the other

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:07,900
people to be part of in

00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:12,250
and work together to maintain our

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,250
indigenous language in the world yeah

00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:20,450
for me my expectation for this is will

00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:24,770
be like it would be nice if hackathon

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:28,910
can help my word with colic can do like

00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:36,170
learning things or what education games

00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:38,210
or application that have my my t-shirt I

00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,970
mean because we were with tisha and it

00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,680
would be nice if we we do like I'm not

00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,090
sure that we can call like a community a

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,770
clap or something like that and then

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:49,040
they can they can talk to each other

00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:51,020
they can share what they the ideas or

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,150
encourage each other by using the

00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,690
language that they are familiar with it

00:45:53,150 --> 00:46:00,230
would be nice and we also in in Thailand

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:03,320
on now nowaday we are not I mean

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:07,430
government is not taking the talk take

00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:11,900
this this this program to to to apply it

00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:14,570
or or the country yet but many many

00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,180
school governments who are interested in

00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:20,660
this and then it would be nice for us if

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:22,340
we have a like a in learning things I

00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,220
think maybe like this and it would be

00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:27,740
because we can express who we can share

00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:34,760
with them more easy and then they can

00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:37,760
approach it okay my expectation from

00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,800
this hackathon is actually most of the

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,770
indigenous peoples in our country in our

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,960
region specifically they live in remote

00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:48,110
areas so sometimes they don't have

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,910
smooth internet connections so I'll be

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:54,520
very much grateful to know from our

00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:57,980
participants and all the experts from

00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:01,370
this hackathon how we can help the

00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,800
indigenous peoples to to make their

00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:08,810
languages available through online and

00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:11,900
offline about both of the ways so for me

00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:14,390
very similar we are living in the very

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,320
remote area so we could have access to

00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:19,430
Internet

00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:22,630
very difficult and for me I'm looking

00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:27,230
for an opportunity in this hackathon

00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:32,390
program to see how can I adjust the app

00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:33,890
or application that I can use some

00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,410
information that we have in our

00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:38,840
community for example in green house

00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:42,530
community volunteer club we are working

00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:46,580
on making short film and also

00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:49,160
documentary and we want to you know like

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:52,100
after we film we document this and how

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,470
can we apply in mobile app and how can

00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,690
this can spread the world you know to

00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,060
make our indigenous to be proud and

00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:01,790
learn about the culture through that

00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:05,000
kind of app and sometimes we we can

00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:07,190
bring like internet like life violence

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,410
we can bring that to community and we

00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,410
can show them so this we call mobile

00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:21,140
show something like that yeah

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:25,700
so I myself also ocm director and I have

00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:28,460
been direct few film already and also in

00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,070
language and I was so proud that I can

00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,920
that I had opportunity to show it in my

00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:36,560
community and there so like they I

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,570
looked so bright and big they cannot

00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,310
imagine that we can do this and they

00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:43,820
laugh a lot and I think that will be

00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:46,940
something that I can apply also in my

00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:49,880
community and other community and also

00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:55,310
one thing the language we also have it

00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:57,980
that outcome oh it says the elder we

00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:02,690
create our own up abit and we are also

00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:06,230
looking for Network here who can also

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:09,680
help us to see if this is something that

00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:13,310
we should keep it you know like record

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,030
it for our Latinas yeah

00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,030
thank you

00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:25,150
what can I say more I think I hope that

00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:27,040
maybe what comes out it's really maybe

00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:30,760
the beginning of something that it's

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,860
going to be be kept in mind by not only

00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,800
the participant to the our cattle but

00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,590
also the entire force Asia community and

00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,080
maybe that some of the innovations that

00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:45,130
are even showcased downstairs in the

00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:48,660
exhibition could be you know retweet and

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:52,210
rethought for for indigenous languages

00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:55,210
and for the digital communities one

00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:58,980
other example I think we were discussing

00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:03,180
this morning was how to use maybe a I

00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:07,120
open-source AI solutions that are maybe

00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:10,600
able to work even offline and they could

00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:14,530
really be helpful in producing tools

00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:23,470
that are you know helping indigenous

00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:26,380
languages to leave very nice innovation

00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,870
to explore here so thank you very much

00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:32,410
