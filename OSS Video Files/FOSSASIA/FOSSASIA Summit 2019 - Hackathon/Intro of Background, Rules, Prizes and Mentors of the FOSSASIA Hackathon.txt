I would just go very quickly to the

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:09,630
sketcher of today and the next two days

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,960
we're gonna present to use the ideas for

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,299
that for the hackathon the rules

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,640
introduce some mentors and the judges

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,180
criteria and then you will have a

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,119

one wassup lunch 1:30 we have another

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,930
workshop with deployment

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,170
I tried atonement on your Cuban Eaters

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:26,909
and at 3 o'clock all the mentors will be

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:30,450
here again to answer the question ok so

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,479
tomorrow the the depend no from 10:30

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,350
tomorrow goes move over beginning of the

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,860
hackathon yes so they're gonna be from

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:46,439
10:30 the UNESCO hour you want to listen

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:50,640
yeah and then on Sunday important time

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:54,090
so exactly a 2 p.m. you need to submit

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,579
your code your your work and the

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:04,460
presentation gonna be from 3:00 to 3:45

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:07,799
after that we have the ceremony at 4:15

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:11,400
okay so we have some very simple rules

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,910
first be excellent to each other we want

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,980
to see the outcome so

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,430
want to see coop we want to see demos so

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,680
work together build something and you're

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,750
supposed to drive your code here so if

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,300
you have done some work early before we

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,910
do not encourage that it is a hackathon

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,330
so the course will be delivered inside

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,430
this hackathon and code orders we have

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:40,770
mentors around so here you who can go

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:43,240
over your code we build something new

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,920
presenter project you submit it you have

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,080
every team need to give a presentation

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:53,890
at the end of the hackathon and team

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,150
size so maximum 5 members in each team

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,100
somebody come to me and ask if it's

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,790
possible to have stick it's not possible

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,380
use open data and your code is open

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,320
which means that you need to publish

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,840
your code on one of their sharing

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,970
platform github gitlab is up to you but

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,970
it must be a valuable for everyone to

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:19,209
use in the future are we clear about the

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:21,100
rules yes we have five prices that we're

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,890
gonna give up at the end of the

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,440
hackathon we have Audion price will be

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,380
voted by the audience we have open sign

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:34,090
price AI development price indigenous

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,040
price and cloud price o the list of the

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,160
prices will I would go into detail on

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,470
Irv you have sign up on that post you

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,550
can look at the data what are exactly

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,500
inside it package over there mentors on

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:52,630
stage so I would like to invite the

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,750
mentors to be on stage to say a quick

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,810
word about what mentors if you are in

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,120
the room please go on stage so the

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,220
mentor will is um go introduce out

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
quickly their expertise so whenever you

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,750
have any question if you view and up and

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,100
no application web allocation so they

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,380
will talk a little bit about their

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,030
expertise so you know who you should

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,670
have brought in case you have questions

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,670
so I will start over here from the video

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:28,939
I mean I know

00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:33,710
so I work out also in the project for

00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:37,370
the indigenous language is here and also

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:41,930
I'm a former coder so I'm a programmer

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:44,960
basically so we happy to help in any

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,349
ways for also for where to look for data

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:54,080
or for example the data from UNESCO for

00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:56,360
example hi my name is Michael I work for

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,699
the United Nations Foundation and I work

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,340
on open source projects so if you're

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,759
interested in looking at or working with

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,159
existing open source projects focused on

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,500
the developing world or the global South

00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:12,289
let me know or if you need help

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,490
tapping into those communities to take

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,199
advantage of some of the things that

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,310
they've built and whatever you might be

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,889
building let me know hello hi I'm Joey

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,830
I'm a JavaScript developer here in

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,810
Singapore and a fan of Linux I'm here

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,669
for a technical support so if you need

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:33,409
help with react or no js' typescript get

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,569
NPM or linux shell scripts that can help

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:41,330
or your development process if you want

00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:44,839
to speed it up I can help with that my

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:50,000
name is Mitch and I'm mostly good with

00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:51,740
hardware simple to complex and but I'm

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,449
pretty good with software as well and

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,650
I'm really good for helping groups

00:05:53,449 --> 00:06:01,669
clarify their ideas and bounce ideas off

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,050
of and motivating people like as you're

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,719
doing a project there are ups and downs

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,960
if you're in a down come and get me and

00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:12,620
I can give you a pep to bring you up

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,020
again so yeah I'm here to help you do

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,469
the cool things that you're all going to

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,159
do so hi my name is Jonas I'm from

00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:23,539
Daimler my I'm a general technologist I

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,250
would say so I have a little bit of

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,909
knowledge about all the kinds of stuff

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,250
that are currently in but I'm not deep

00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:34,129
in it usually where I'm really deep in

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,810
is currently the whole blockchain thing

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:39,060
so if you have questions about that and

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,639
want to stare Indian journalists

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:47,110
for human man card for all time then we

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,060
can do that hi I'm max I'm working at

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,070
Stateville Singaporean company where I

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,050
do machine learning and bacon

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:58,600
engineering mostly so I'm glad to help

00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,820
in those areas hi my name is Marco I

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,080
live here in Singapore I run a few

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,509
courses on Python machine learning some

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,789
data science so maybe if you have

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,860
questions maybe regarding machine

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:13,360
translation stuff like that you can

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,000
reach me anytime

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,449
I'm also the guy down there with the

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,820
robot kid and the PS lab guys so if you

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:26,710
go to the exhibition area I'll probably

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:29,680
be around hi my name is Andrea as you

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,530
know I'm a software developer and

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:38,310
developer advocate I work for IBM my Mac

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:40,270
background is mainly in open source and

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,060
infrastructure is a service type of

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,860
project so containers your two machine

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,360
serverless this kind of stuff I've got

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,940
background in machine learning as well

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,389
and of course you can ask me about

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:55,120
services in the IBM cloud no one know

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:59,440
about I'm from an IT company in Tokyo

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,449
but this is unrelated I'm well I'm a

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,610
mathematician computer scientists you

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:08,229
can ask me about similar things like

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,300
from full stack development F obstacles

00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:12,550
out stuff but much more interesting is

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,460
probably that I have 30 years of like

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,199
non-latin writing system experience and

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,030
and learning experience in various

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,220
languages so if you have questions about

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:26,409
writing system then you can ask me hello

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,590
i'm motor abacus tripura

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:32,979
i'll be happy to see the use of

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,529
indigenous languages in using the open

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,820
sources so there's very much my

00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,820
interesting area thank you

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:49,660
hello I am from Vietnam so I am a

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:52,720
software developer you can ask me about

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,600
web programming including back-end and

00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:03,130
front-end and also embedded programming

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:26,980
like we know IOT leaders so mentors

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:29,020
photo ok so we have more mentors some

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,430
might be now giving our talks in

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,480
different room they will come in

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:39,370
throughout the hackathons if so I will

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,260
introduce them later judging criteria so

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,050
these are a few things that you need to

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,290
pay attention to technical

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,580
implementation yeah so I think it's

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,370
quite our debauch I don't need to use

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,300
blenders of course we're gonna test your

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,910
code in the application that you develop

00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,580
project adaptation so if you read on

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,500
their post the website is it learns

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,440
about hackathon you understand that we

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,140
expect you to develop something based on

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,570
one of the Foss Asia project so if you

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,110
have something that be based on Zhu CAI

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,660
Pakistan labpas K or one of the projects

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,790
of force Asia you will get a bonus born

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,520
for the s and he said the double bonus

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:26,200
point yeah use open data and open

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:29,440
knowledge usability is it you sir how

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,630
easily for the user to use the app it's

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,870
mean user interface design of the

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,209
application solution high potential to

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,820
engage a wide range of actors into

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:41,770
society so not only for you at developer

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,950
to use it pretty possible for people to

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,149
contribute if you want to give feedback

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,400
replication or if they want to in hand

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,410
let's say you allow the user to collect

00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,910
data enhance application so this is

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,790
about engagement

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,889
scalability so is it possible only in
