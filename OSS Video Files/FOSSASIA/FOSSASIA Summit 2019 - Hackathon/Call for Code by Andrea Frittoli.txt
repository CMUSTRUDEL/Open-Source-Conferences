Title: Call for Code by Andrea Frittoli
Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Hackathon
Description: 
	15 March 2019 15:20, Event Hall 2-2 (Hack Stage)

100,000 developers from 156 nations accepted the challenge and built over 2,500 applications in 2018. Over 60 organizations amplified the Call as supporters last year. Will you answer the call in 2019? https://callforcode.org

Commit to the Cause. Push for Change. Answer the Call.

Developers have revolutionized the way people live and interact with virtually everyone and everything. Where most people see challenges, developers see possibilities. Thatâ€™s why David Clark Cause launched Call for Code in 2018 alongside Founding Partner IBM. This multi-year global initiative is a rallying cry to developers to use their skills and mastery of the latest technologies, and to create new ones, to drive positive and long-lasting change across the world with their code. The second annual Call for Code Challenge theme is natural disaster preparedness and relief in the context of community health and well-being.

welcome Andrea of course so hello

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,639
everyone it's great to see so many of

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,250
you here today so my name is Andrea

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,539
Italy I'm open source developer advocate

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,580
at IBM so my team focuses on advocating

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,550
on open source technologies to which IBM

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,570
is a large contributor but I wanted to

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,119
talk today about

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,310
colfer code initiative so this is a

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,019
five-year initiative that is happen

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,380
year by year so we have the first

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,079
edition last year in 2018 and today that

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,129
this year in 2019 we're continuing with

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,829
the second edition so the idea is to

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,460
make a call to software developers to

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,530
use their skills their creativity their

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,480
intuition their ideas originality to

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,059
develop code that help solve problems in

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,210
the world like when you have emergency

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,370
situation or disasters natural disaster

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,830
happening they are usually very

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,350
difficult situation happening like

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,659
people loses communication to the

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,840
network it cannot request it can't

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,680
communicate with the first aid it can't

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:22,680
communicate the need for basic things

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:26,820
like medicines or you know food water so

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,119
the idea is let's put a price and make

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,000
this a global initiative so people the

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,689
software developers are motivated to you

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,659
know come up with great ideas and then

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:45,960
we can continue from the idea and help

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:50,040
it develop it so this is a little bit of

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,369
information from what we did in 2018 so

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,829
there was a very large participation it

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,320
works with with teams so we had more

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,000
than hundred thousand teams the

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:07,290
developers had participated and 2,500

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,959
applications we also have called confer

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,670
code in events around the world so they

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,770
are called cold for cold days we're like

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,090
small hackathons focused on developing

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:21,810
things that are towards this initiative

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,570
and the project winner for 2018 was

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,500
project owl there is a solution that is

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:31,170
based on both hardware software so they

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,420
created some kind of rubber duck devices

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,690
and five of them they can float and they

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,240
can create a local network that allows

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,550
people to communicate and send voice

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,190
messages using kind of a voice assistant

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,040
and then these messages can reach a

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,790
dashboard that is accessible by like

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:59,160
first eight people that can retrieve

00:02:50,790 --> 00:03:01,940
these messages so in 2019 now we want to

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,280
continue this the focus for the nine

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,340
2019 edition for colfur code is on

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,530
personal and community well-being as you

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,510
can imagine in emergency situation it

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,820
can be more likely for instance for

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,140
plague to spread for there could be also

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,120
psychological impact and stress on

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,740
people before and after some catastrophe

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,560
happens so the idea is to create

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,050
solution to support personal and

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,760
community well-being and we thought we

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,400
could present this here at the Akutan

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,820
today because it sounded like kind of

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,900
fitting type of intent with with with

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,900
what is with the are Katan

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,430
so apart from Colfer code there is

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,530
another initiative that is starting this

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,310
year which is called cold cold response

00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:00,060
it's a four year initiative and the idea

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,010
is to actually take this project that

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,290
work came out of code for code and make

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:11,730
them real so there is again funding and

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:14,310
engineering that is supported by IBM to

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,750
actually take the winner of the code for

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,700
code initiative in 2018 and actually

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,359
take it to production make it real make

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,359
it happen

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,630
so if you decide to participate to

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,930
color-code there are some judge it

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:38,230
criterias that will be applied in terms

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:43,180
of completeness so how complete is your

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:46,750
solution is and so the idea is that you

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,190
have the akka tone today you might want

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,620
to take your solution that you're

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,780
developing today and continue develop it

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,460
and develop it further get it to a state

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,090
of completeness where it's ready to

00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,790
submission for the colfer code right so

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:04,750
also we will judge on effectiveness and

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,920
efficiency design stability of course

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,400
and usability and I think personally I

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,930
like the the fourth one very much is

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,450
creativity and innovation so innovation

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,560
using new technologies of course but

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:22,480
it's not only that it's really finding

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,730
kind of out of the box way to solve

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,380
problems so new ways to solve problems

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,020
that people has not thought about yet of

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:40,410
course we we have prizes for the first

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:43,810
three places which are like $36,000

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:51,400
$24,000 in $12,000 for the first three

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:54,670
places and in terms of implementing your

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,810
solution you might want to look at the

00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:01,720
developer site from IBM of course we as

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,790
IBM we have multiple services in our

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,220
cloud and we do provide what we call

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,350
code patterns are examples of how you

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,320
can utilize technology to combine

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,110
different technologies to you know as to

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,420
create some solution these are examples

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,700
to get you started in getting to know a

00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,740
certain technology that you can use as

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,680
aspiration to combine with your

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:28,840
innovative and creative ideas and I mean

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,130
we spend a lot of technologies with the

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,930
services that we have here and we have

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,300
different services and there are some

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,789
some of them I think could be

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,120
specifically interesting apart from this

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,729
standard kind application as a service

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,560
infrastructure as a service services we

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,840
also have all the watson services in our

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,020
cloud and i think you might find them

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,770
interesting for this kind of solution

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,710
because you have things like

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,139
text-to-speech tone analyzation visual

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,990
recognition all these AI power type of

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,750
services might be interesting to combine

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,389
with the color code so if you decide to

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,080
apply for colfer code your solution

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,940
should use at least one of the services

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,590
at least one of the api on the IBM cloud

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,479
it doesn't need to be hosted on there be

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,889
M cloud but it should use at least one

00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:23,610
of the services there so yeah that's all

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,400
I had for today we have a dedicated

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,199
office hour for IBM cloud technologies

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,990
and services tomorrow morning I think at

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,509
11:00 so it's one hour I will be here

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,099
and of course we are in the exposition

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,870
hall at the booth so if you have any

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,530
questions either find us at the booth

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,840
that's always a good point a good place

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,340
to find us so just come around and talk

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:51,290
to us thank you

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,290
