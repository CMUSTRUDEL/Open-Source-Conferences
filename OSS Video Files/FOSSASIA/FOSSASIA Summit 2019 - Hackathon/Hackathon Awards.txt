this for a moment also for a small

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:47,030
recapture of the hackathon so like how

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,990
many people here in this room

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,220
participated and coded at the hackathon

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,220
please raise your hand okay

00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:02,670
that's pretty good so big round of

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:05,580
applause for this big effort please okay

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,140
I think it was really a great idea like

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,970
but this hackathon actually we're always

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,460
trying to do something new we're trying

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,830
to go to new levels so we added like

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,450
this requirement to make open-source

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,150
technologies especially we want to

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,470
people to connect with us then we had

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,660
this idea of indigenous languages

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,180
because the year of indigenous languages

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,380
that the UNESCO brought in and so the

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,350
great thing was actually that we could

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,170
bring over ten indigenous experts here

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,870
as well so thank you very much

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,840
especially to Masako who had this idea

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,730
here to get all these indigenous experts

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,680
and I think it's a great example how we

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,660
can connect people especially in Asia

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,960
it's also very interesting that I'm

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,310
saying that as a European so like not

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,650
just Asian people so we bring everyone

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,120
here together to develop new solution so

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,360
and now we are ready with the open

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,940
science prize so I just yes indeed so

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,950
maybe we can ask one of the judges next

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,170
to come up to award the open science

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,380
prize and so this is a slightly

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,850
different set of goodies but maybe so I

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,950
mentioned you would like come up because

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:14,370
science fits very well with what you do

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:17,000
indeed yeah yes okay and so the you want

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,000
to announce the

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,320
judges are looking at the inclusion of

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,380

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,650
so uh that's the that's the wrong that's

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:13,370

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:16,460
give it's one more price that the jury

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:20,660
decided maybe home folk you can help to

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:23,240
announce it wonderful actually you saw

00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,370
that we took a lot of time right and it

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,020
was very difficult to decide and

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,580
actually then like different team

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,050

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,580
right but like it was it was really

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,290
difficult right I think it was very

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,810
tight and we also saw that was the

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,340
audience price actually I know like

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,350
crowdsource did a great job and they won

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,490
but it was also tight compared to others

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,870
who had tied vote as well and of course

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,880
