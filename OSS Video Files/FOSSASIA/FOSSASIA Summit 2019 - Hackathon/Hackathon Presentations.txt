some brief background to what's been

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,180
going on these last few days we kicked

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,570
off the hackathon on the 15th of March

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,909
and we ran this for really two days with

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,340

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,400
and assistance to improve people's lives

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,950
and the focus has been to use Foss Asia

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,130
technology in the year of indigenous

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,049
languages so not an easy challenge but

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,299
certainly a very relevant topic

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,310
especially for Asia with its many

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,880
different languages and different

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,530
cultures can I ask you to be quiet

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,939

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:46,649
so we've had 194 registered participants

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:49,770

two days and we had 15 final submissions

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,110

lonely what's needed many of us have

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,860
talked directly so it's me but actually

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,230
I should be last

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,010

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,850

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,960
great to have the expertise combined

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:19,030
expertise of the community with Michael

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:21,090
the board thank you very much all right

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,160
so getting into the heart of the matter

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,560
the most challenging part is the judging

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,199
criteria and just for complete

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,780
transparency of course the judges are

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,400
evaluating technical implementation the

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,770
open data and open knowledge and the

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,380
application there of usability and UX

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,050
which is very important scalability and

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,120
replicate ability we have inclusiveness

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,449
and then of course the focus on

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,460
indigenous languages and last there'll

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,530
be an element of judging on the use of

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,720
force Asia technologies so that really

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,770
brings together the value of this Foss

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,750
Asia conference this is the lineup so

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,150
we've got 15 teams which is fantastic

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,680
it's gonna be a fairly intense afternoon

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,080
so I need the teams to be ready and

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,449
prepared but also keep to their time and

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,860
I get four minutes four minutes to

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,389
present and the team should also make

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,159
sure they balance between the

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,479
presentation but also their

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,370
demonstration if they have something to

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,840
demonstrate the judges want to see that

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,580
they want to evaluate how much you've

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,710
been able to deliver if that's been

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,479
possible within your team and one minute

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,099
for QA and will be very strict on this

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,130
but we hope the judges have some good

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,810
questions lined up for these teams so

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,590
teams just make note and we'll

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,770
coordinate this and after this at the

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,150
end we'll have an audience vote so at

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,039
the end of this will show this link

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,710
again and you'll be able to access this

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,880
URL and submit a vote and that vote will

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,840
go towards a prize at the end and so

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,070
we'll get to the prizes later but

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,340
there's gonna be five prizes of which

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,340
one is this audience vote prize so make

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,870
sure during that we we access this link

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,289
again so make a note of this link now if

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,830
you want but will will assign the prizes

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:50,790
the concept is we would like

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,250
we still raise awareness to to help the

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,379
children or the young step to come back

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,800
to their own language but however we

00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:01,350
don't have we are not ready to prepare

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,259
anything yet but however so we create

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,730
this app to help the the youngster if

00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:10,800
they are come back so we are ready this

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,259
application basically consists of three

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,689
levels for the youngsters for the

00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,350
Millennials to easily understand an

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,000
approach

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,000
the first level is basic level which

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,709
consists of basic greetings of how to

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,370
understand the language to how to

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:29,790
approach people from different languages

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:34,050
it based it only basic greetings written

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:38,370
scripts also for voice on the second

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:41,670
level basically as a second level can

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,199
consist of community here we connect the

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,810
people who know the language to the

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,779
people who are learning the language it

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,569
is very this basically type of a chart

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,509
you can see when I post I don't know the

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:57,930
language when I post hello the people

00:10:54,509 --> 00:11:00,689
who know the language for example we

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,600
took the Korean here they are

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:06,720
then message the same thing in Korean

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,540
language so in this way the people with

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,399
basics can learn medium level of

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,110
language so the person is done with the

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,269
two levels and when he attends good

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,500
knowledge about the language he can come

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,269
into the third level which is the

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,220
advanced level where in here the

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:24,630
research work the book are reading and

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,550
all when he wants to explode more about

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,110
the language he can read books and all

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,149
we have database containing all the book

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,709
details and all so they they can just

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,000
look into it and connect with the

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,649
scholars we can connect them with the

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,190
scholars so that they can learn more

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:39,590
about

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,090
and as Millennials are most used to

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,820
smartphone now we are also planning to

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,160
have a Android app application Android

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,240
application along with the web-based

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,750
application and we also plan to have

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,810
games because which that helps us

00:11:53,750 --> 00:12:02,510
understand more about the Korean culture

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:06,260
in a wider context many people say that

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:11,030
if technology is grow up it's mean that

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:14,540
is it can lose we can lose our cultures

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,910
it's easy and it's for us we think that

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,150
probably yes and no yes it's mean that

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:22,400
we are not ready for that but for us we

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,340
think that we say we can say no because

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:29,360
we can develop those thing and we are

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:32,000
ready for for for the chain Oh

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,090
as you can see these are three levels

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,830
but we are planning for the future

00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,260
implementation that is we are planning

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:42,740
to connect through zai so that when I

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,780
mess is the language it should read the

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,400
language because many people doesn't

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,310
know the script for the

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,470
understandability this was EA I will

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:57,680
design in such a way that it can read

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:59,540
the language and it can pronounce it

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,000
properly so that people who are learning

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:05,000
it can learn properly time's up

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,520
ok good team let's see if it's got some

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,840
questions run our calls

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,370
[Applause]

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,450
any questions from the judges you've got

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,450
one minute for that

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:27,550
so thank you very much so you said you

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,920
haven't been able to do functioning

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:36,420
thing but I see on the submission there

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:39,490
is actually quite a lot of code so you

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,170
can you explain more or less what would

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:46,360
you be able to do or how this is

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:48,870
functioning this the question including

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,870
the skills

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,530
did I mention I think on these skills

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:12,930
we are adding the Susie AI voice further

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,930
pronouncing the message

00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,100
ee is all code in the repository so it's

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,630
just a basic chord we just threw out

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,250
some chord but then we could finish it

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,120
if given some time we'll definitely

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,120
finish the part

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,710
okay Thank You team let's bring up the

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,710
next team in the next team will be

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,800
caught sauce copper's generation and can

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:47,480
the next team Khurana rescue translator

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:50,110
please form up in front are you here

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,110
connect

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,910
USBC

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:06,660
okay so for those who popped into the

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,980
2-2 theater here on the second floor we

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,630
had all these teams sitting there in

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,850
different groups programming away for

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,950
the last few days so that's been quite a

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,780
challenge I mean these volunteers take

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,190
it upon themselves to participate in

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,130
this hackathon and deliver something

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,820
functional and and prove a product in a

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:26,610
short amount of time

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:31,110
this team is crowd-sourced corpus okay

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,640
over to crowdsource copies so before he

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,710
gets started with the slides let me just

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,930
introduce ourselves I'm a caution from

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:41,550
IOT Varanasi and this is my team I'm a

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,670
mystic tonic a proud open-source

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,620
contributor I'm Raja

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:50,430
Dube open-source contributor from

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:54,360
whatever this India I'm Shivan Gupta and

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:56,370
I contribute to Suzy project I'm Sonia

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,400
an open source contributed in Mozilla

00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,400
Firefox

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,690
all right so we did not get much time to

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,050
prepare a fancy slide so I'll just you

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,360
know focus on me so what we have built

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,250
is called a crowd-sourced corpus

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,620
generator and people those who don't

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,329
know what a corpus corpus is a corpus is

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,519
basically a list of millions of

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,680
sentences and maybe their translations

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,970
or maybe the u.s. tagging so it can be

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,149
anything depending on what you want to

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,220
use it for all right so why do we call

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,690
it crowd-sourced so obviously we are

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,110
trying to get the translations from the

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:35,320
crowd but the problem is that a crowd

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,839
cannot be trusted right so what our

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,610
system is trying to solve is giving a

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,980
metric whether a translation can be

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,019
trusted or not and of course we have

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,540
further improved on the features so I'll

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:48,760
get down to that

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,750
so our it seems like we have some

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,750
technical issues

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:06,660
sure yeah so our whole app I mean the

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,700
platform itself consists of two major

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,190
parts so one is the translation itself

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,740
so there's a platform which will collect

00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,540
the translations and there's another

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,930
side to the platform which will be used

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,120
to give our CSV data or maybe like any

00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,800
researcher who wishes to work with NLP

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,740
applications or maybe machine

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:30,270
translation so the platform provides an

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,380
easy-to-use copies generator so the

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,220
problem we are trying to solve is

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,740
basically crowdsourcing it and is this

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,080
actually needed because you see in case

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,470
of indigenous languages there are not

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,810
many translators who are working and the

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,060
people who know the language are either

00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,310
few in number or they are not accessible

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,620
most of the times so this platform is

00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,110
basically taking it to a remote level so

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,960
that people who are kind of bilingual

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,570
like knowing somewhat both the languages

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,420
they can make use of this application to

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,090
help the community but again like I said

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,470
crowd cannot become trusted so a person

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,540
who is somewhat sure about the answer

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,260
and a person who is absolutely sure

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,680
about the answer

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,450
so this is where are the I mean the

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,030
algorithm that we have thought of our

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:22,890
kicks in so so let me rephrase what we

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,900
have actually built this is not a data

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:30,120
collector it's actually an intelligent

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:32,040
data collector right so so let me show

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,630
the math that we have used here so this

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,700
is basically a vector representation

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,670
this is just a simple vector

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,310
representation this is a plane in which

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,980
we have vectors so what we have done is

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:45,750
we have say for a sentence we have ten

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,680
translations where that have been given

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,200
by ten different users

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,080
so each translation is converted to a

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,150
word vector and is represented on our

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,150
vector space so

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,620
so using that vector representation we

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,059
generate a mean vector and the vector

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,160
which is closest to the mean vector is

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,710
selected as our best possible

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,210
translation but then again a standard

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,730
deviation of the whole distribution is

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,549
calculated and if the deviation is a bit

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,049
on the lower side then we are I mean we

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,549
can say that we are confident about the

00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,130
mean vector that we have generated but

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:21,750
then again if the standard deviation is

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,860
on the higher end you would say that we

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,690
are not confident about that answer

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,940
right so this is the main gist of our

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:34,140
application and this is how it actually

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:38,460
works so this is the dashboard that we

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,000
have built so the translation part that

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,799
I talked about

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,270
so that is integrated and that can be

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,309
integrated into many different platforms

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,000
where you all you need to do is

00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:49,799
basically take input from users yeah and

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,290
this is the dashboard that a researcher

00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:54,240
might see for now we have just tested

00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,520
and tested it on a fewer number of

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,460
samples but as you can see those are the

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,690
English sentences and the indigenious

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,850
counter power so I'm sorry the labels

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,290
have been inverted it seems and the

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:09,570
score that we have generated is being

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:11,760
generated by the algorithm I guess can

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:19,040
we demonstrate them itself so if you

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:21,230
have any questions let me know yeah

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,650
there's that use button which you will

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,650
click and the CSV is download questions

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,870
so yes I didn't get what technology are

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,570
you using do you have a back-end also

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,570
over yes yes yes we have a back-end

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,770
which will be used to communicate to any

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,070
other platform which is trying to

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:48,800
integrate our solution to this so let's

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,440
say we have Suzy and Suzy

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,840
I mean Suzy user just wants to pitch in

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,380
to this translation task so he just

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,140
gives in like a keyboard and we send him

00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:02,390
one particular sentence which he'll have

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,250
to translate and this data is sent back

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,680
to our back-end and the algorithm tries

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,150
to figure out I mean tries to get that

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,310
particular sentence that particular

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:14,320
translation is score and which will be

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,320
displayed here as you can see

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:37,100
complicated rules like let's say we have

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:41,060
like role which is based on trust

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:44,120
ability so a person can have more more

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,040
rights if they reach us at war for some

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,130
will have a number of edits have

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,220
verified an account things like that and

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,500
also our voted trustworthy by and not by

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,660
a lot of other trustworthy people yeah I

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,970
understand your question so that can be

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,800
a possibility so if a person is a valid

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,230
translator he is a qualified translator

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,490
maybe his contribution could be given a

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,220
mortgage as compared to the other

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,380
translators so I like for you for me I

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,450
don't know German and if I try to

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,950
translate a German sentence maybe my

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,380
translation would be given a less weight

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,910
is as compared to you right so that can

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,250
be a possibility we haven't done that

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,270
here but yes it's an extension which can

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,270
be easily integrated in interest

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,670
we are not using any data set we are

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,430
trying to generate a data set this is

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:37,480
crowd sourcing the generation itself so

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:39,190
we can either take yeah yeah

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,940
so crowd sourcing the data generation

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,750
that is our aim alright so there are

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,020
already available

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,720
I mean openly available corpuses so we

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,510
can just strip away the English part and

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,040
we can use that English part as the set

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,950
from which the user will be given the

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,830
sentence and then the user gives in

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:07,000
indigenous translation ok round of

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:10,000
applause for this team thank you okay so

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,600
to team crowdsource corpus I think a

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,310
good recovery from your technical

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,860
hiccups but teams please be aware that

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,830
you need to be prepped and ready to plug

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:25,030
in and have your slides come up so we

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:28,740
don't have too much time to lose right

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,760
so judges I think there was a

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,060
comprehensive presentation on a fairly

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,120
technical subject matter but also a good

00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:54,220
application of Susy next we have Kerala

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:59,590
rescue translators Kerala okay popular

00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:00,940
online indigenous crafts okay team

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,740
you're gonna get four minutes and then

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,090
one minutes for Q&A and we're gonna have

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,990
the timer on the left hand side here

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:12,270
okay next team will be two genius are

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,270
you here big genius

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,030
like good afternoon my name is Poonam

00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,799
tano and belong to a Korean indigenous

00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:22,419
group I worked with I work with

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,480
indigenous media network in Thailand so

00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:30,830
hello my name is Jean she's Niharika and

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,440
he searched we are from India yes so

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,200
I'll just briefly interview about our

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,340
idea and concept or making this app so

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,600
the idea is we make an application for

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,429
indigenous people and non-indigenous

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,010
people to access to this kind of

00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:48,230
platform in this app we are loved

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,530
indigenous people rather globe to

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:54,710
publish the owns the community story and

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:57,380
sell their their own products from from

00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,230
their own communities and we allow the

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,020
youth our indigenous youth in who living

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,000
or studying in the city to exit to this

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,270
kind of app and bring a product from

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,240
their parents to post and for for

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:14,450
selling on this kind of app so this app

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,179
if it desert built it will be helped

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,549
it will help indigenous people to revive

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,260
just not only their language but they

00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:23,059
are culture their traditional knowledge

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,460
in making this kind of product and

00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:28,400
relating to natural resource management

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,559
and ecosystem as well so my friend will

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:38,419
demonstrate it so late this is actually

00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:41,030
not a shop shopping site but it's going

00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:43,900
to help the charity and NGO starter

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:47,270
being data available in the indigenous

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:50,210
communities to grow like if here if he's

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,559
a customer he's going to come and search

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,030
for the communities here look he's

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,990
looking to contribute I'd so once he

00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:00,590
likes some of the communities like

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,780
suppose there are some cancer based NGOs

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,080
some angels are working for the women

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,580
and much more communities are there so

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,700
once you select any of the communities

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,440
he will be able to contribute and you

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,440
will be able to purchase any of the

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,510
products so apart from this we have we

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,210
also have got a premium premium

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,120
membership that what it does is you need

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:25,610
to pay like only five dollars per month

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,070
if you pay that money you will become a

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,009
premium member and you will be allowed

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,409
to attain each and every event that is

00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:36,679
going to take place in the native places

00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:39,860
of that community or enjoy also apart

00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:42,769
from this you will get the products for

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,159
free monthly like that are being made by

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:49,070
any members or the students of that

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:54,139
community so the basic idea behind this

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:57,350
was that suppose a people a person is

00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:59,840
from Malaysia and I'm from India so we

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,090
meet there's no chance that we will be

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,490
able to recognize each other or we will

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,559
be able to talk to each other but when

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,960
we come in contact with some products

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,369
like if you buy some products we like

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,909
some products we tell our friends that

00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:16,700
the these results we get from this place

00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:20,360
and they they all build it so this is

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:25,549
going to help the community so this is

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:27,619
the video of the app so these are the

00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:30,100
communities if you select the if you

00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:30,100
first login

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,960
so these are the communities so you will

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:39,659
get the information regarding the

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,490
communities and once you select in your

00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,159
favorite they will be available in your

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:50,340
check list and you will be able to buy

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:52,590
the products then yes this is so harsh

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:59,940
it has a prototype so if any of the

00:27:52,590 --> 00:28:02,940
judges want to see you can check it yeah

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:20,669
so thank you you guys are good on time

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:23,490
well done team yes all of data are open

00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,970
data that provided by indigenous people

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,970
themself

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,270
how how do you get to the data how do

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,850
you get how we get the data right

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,740
because we work with image in the

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,750
network for example I work with AI will

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,910
be indigenous people by predation that

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,090
work we work with indigenous people in

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:57,150
14th country in Asia and also work with

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,830
from 48 organizations thing like that

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,960
and we have a group we colored mekong

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,360
regions caucus with working with

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,030
indigenous people in five countries so

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,640
we can just maximize this kind of

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,980
network alliance that we have to

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:16,799
introduce the app and bring information

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:19,350
to them further questions from the

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,049
judges time for more just won't be a

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,049
security side of it restoring they're

00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,340
just a prototype currently we hardcore

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:33,360
the data into database SQLite database

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:37,470
and we do from there how are you

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,650
thinking about security and we can use

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:43,549
firebase currently a limited time so I

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,549
just output

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:54,059
okay anyone off you want to see the

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,149
prototype if you okay you have shown

00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,769
your prototype oh yeah

00:29:56,149 --> 00:30:02,779
okay because we were tight for time I

00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,779
think Team Europe so thank you very much

00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:15,989
okay so our popular online indigenous

00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:17,519
crafts as our team was was certainly

00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:19,919
aware of the complexities of indigenous

00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,899
languages and also the the number of

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,519
challenges of sourcing the data I think

00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:25,350
that's the biggest hurdle in any machine

00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,049
learning is getting access to the data

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,940
in order to train the models so going

00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:33,029
down to grassroots level is it's

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,970
definitely one way of doing that this

00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:38,899
team that we is tweet generous right

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,769
okay so next team up is tweet generous

00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,769
here's your microphone can we

00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,260
so our team is vagenis division s is

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,750
basically a Twitter tool for indigenous

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,370
people currently like the government

00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,160
does not have any system in case of

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,990
disasters to like take data throughout

00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,150
to give data or take data from Twitter

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,700
to provide help to the indigenous people

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,490
so we have developed herbs which will

00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,200
get data from Twitter and like using the

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,660
hashtags we will use the hashtags as the

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,980
input once you put a hashtag in you can

00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,320
choose a language in which you want the

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,590
hashtag once the hashtag has been given

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,300
a given given our return the tweet

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,550
tweets with the hashtags and other

00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,020
tweets which have similar hashtags but

00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:24,290
this the government can find out where

00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,390
the natural calamity calamity is like

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,280
verse and send help immediately this is

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:32,150
for helping the rural people as well

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,800
like they can check which if any natural

00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,590
disasters headed their way I can move to

00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,330
save shelters and this is basically what

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,429
region is does we have also started

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,610
localization of a few apps of Accession

00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:45,920
like the PS labs android app is a really

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,210
great app it is very good for students

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,850
to learn science but the office

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,990
currently only in English so like it

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,000
cannot be used by everybody

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,460
we have localized the PS labs are in

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,260
Nepali language so that people who speak

00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,080
Nepali and are not really well-versed

00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,850
with English can also use that I will

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,640
show the screen shots of the app and our

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:08,200
site as soon as the technical is

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,200
resolved please bear with us

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,230
I would like to discuss the web app in

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,330
the web app we are taking two inputs

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,210
first would be the hash tag of the

00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:26,370
specific event that he wants to the

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,170
government or any ang NGO wants to

00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:30,090
search the next input will be the

00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,160
language that he wants to search any

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,780
indigenous language can be added but at

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,510
the moment we are using Nepali as a

00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,610
indigenous language when we when the

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,770
user will submit click the submit button

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,570
we are using the idea of millings

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,360
generator that is another position app

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,040
to trigger a Travis Travis will and the

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,690
Travis will will run a Python script and

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,630
will give us the data that will be shown

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:55,040
in graphical form that will be discussed

00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,040
by my colleague Rob

00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,020
hello yeah this will be the front end

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,570
part here we will pass the query like I

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,820
have already taken this is based on the

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:18,280
Nepal earthquake so here I will be using

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,990
Nepali language so it will face the data

00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:29,230
we have already collected from the

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:31,690
Twitter so this will face and how it

00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,420
works first of all we have used local F

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,790
to collect all the tweets and we used

00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,370
some Python scripts to extract the hash

00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:41,500
tags from the tweets and we processed

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,960
all the tweets to reduce the noise so

00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,040
this so that the precision of the system

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:51,610
can be improved so you can follow the

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,500
implementation like we have used the

00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,110
library and we have imported the file

00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,660
which we collected from the Twitter and

00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:02,500
after pre-processing this step are all

00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,900
involved the pre-processing part and

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,120
after that I have extracted we have

00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,640
extracted the hash tag using some

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,940
regular expressions and we have plotted

00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,669
the hash tags here you can see some hash

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,040
tags like whom government can use this

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:21,130
water to provide the relief very

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,260
effectively like this in the tweets the

00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,679
hash tag whom is used frequently that

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,990
means there may be chances that people

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,020
have lose their homes so government can

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:35,200
use to build some more refugee shelters

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,840
so that they can provide some pre pre

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,870
pre data can be obtained and here you

00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,780
can see some reverse names that means in

00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:46,030
in those situations these rivers have

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,850
badly affected so government can use

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:52,290
this water to extract or remove those

00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:55,480
people from those areas this can be Pepi

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:59,800
previously can be done before the yeah

00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,230
before the high high casualties and here

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,500
you can see some states some districts

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:09,250
names are also visible like say to potty

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,920
and Hamrick aura so command can use this

00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:14,440
is tates like use these states to

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,350
provide the priorities so that command

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,690
can provide

00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:21,850
wireless service first of these cities

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:25,940
then two other respective cities right

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:30,890
your time's up team okay just run them

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:32,840
applause I think this is particularly

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:37,400
challenging when you're under pressure

00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,670
and stress to get up and running over to

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,670
the judges

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,220
PS loves up we have created translations

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,560
for the app and it is very functional

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,880
how it works if you want I can show you

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,040
a live demonstration my mobile yes

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,990
laughs since this being a poor Foss Asia

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,580
we just like made translation so that

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,780
data can be viewed in Nepali as well

00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,780
currently it is only in English

00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,290
okay thank you very much

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,140
okay team

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:42,259
right unfortunate but challenging to

00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:47,499
present without slides so let's hope we

00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:50,119
can address these challenges yes my name

00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:51,680
something right and I'm belong to

00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,829
Pournami Latinas and I'm from Cambodia

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,920
and I'm working for Cambodian education

00:36:54,829 --> 00:37:01,700
I'm happy to be here today and my team

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,730
will present our home of original

00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,880
peoples and my friend

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,880
[Music]

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:16,720
good afternoon everybody my name is dawn

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:21,610
and from Laos and we both indigenous

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:25,240
from Mekong region and our web developer

00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:27,970
are not here with us so basically we we

00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:31,650
are working on the web site on book by

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,650
ourselves so

00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:49,910
so the idea of developing the website is

00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:55,219
to preserve and promote indigenous

00:37:49,910 --> 00:38:00,170
language through animation and also use

00:37:55,219 --> 00:38:11,329
our culture by learning English through

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:15,019
the culture through sport arts yeah then

00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:16,969
you can talk about the vision okay this

00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:19,400
is our vision and mission that we create

00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:21,849
the home of indigenous people and the

00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,680
reason we want to protect the cultures

00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:26,660
social and traditional knowledge or

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,150
traditional system of indigenous people

00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,099
and collect and share the traditional

00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,969
knowledge about indigenous groups

00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:36,709
because our website is not just only

00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:38,599
focused on the indigenous in the Mekong

00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:42,319
but also we can look for the who are

00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:44,119
working on the indigenous issue and also

00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,279
we empower indigenous people especially

00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,319
we promote the rise of indigenous people

00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:53,900
to land without line with our eye and

00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:55,880
with our culture - okay and how we can

00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,449
do this work because we have the

00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,269
specific plan after this meeting we will

00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:05,630
form a working group and then we really

00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:07,759
need like developer who can help us - -

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:11,179
to design how it can all work and also

00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:13,999
we will build a database like we have

00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:17,150
like a cultural history for each group

00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:22,670
like art photography record he has

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:25,249
something like this ok next yeah he is

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,289
the the way forward that we we will work

00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:30,109
like training the young indigenous

00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:33,429
people in technologies and also teach

00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:36,859
how they promote the cultures in the

00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:38,539
website and Happiness people to

00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,759
communicate with the international

00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:44,420
community through they using a

00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:46,130
dictionary and translation a cocoa

00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,929
translation as well as this is kind of

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,660
thing that we think it's important for

00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:52,190
us indigenous people to do do kind of

00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,750
work yes

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:57,260
this is our website yeah

00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,260
you can click

00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,430
yes yes our website I hope everybody

00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,869
will enjoys can you show us the website

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,940
briefly you've got a bit of time left

00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:45,830
tackle yeah

00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:48,440
so if you go to the home and then you

00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:52,250
will see this this is the idea that we

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,760
want to post for example this one this

00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:59,690
one is Brunel indigenous from Cambodia

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,850
and this from Camus yeah like this and

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,760
then when you click to each indigenious

00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:07,580
and then you see the language so you

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,190
click on like let's learn Boon Heong

00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:13,820
language and the culture let's learn

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:17,060
Boon Heong language and sport like

00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:24,470
something like that ok thank you very

00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:26,869
much ok so the judges some questions to

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,100
the website of cultural artifacts and

00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:30,100
and learning

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,010
any questions from the panel

00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:48,990
so how do you how you going to fit in

00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:56,190
the site with the data properly sir how

00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:58,980
do you maintain the data I mean thank

00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:02,670
you for the question how we can maintain

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:06,450
it so first video do research and then

00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:09,780
we also will allow indigenous from the

00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:12,960
region to contribute the information

00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,580
especially on art culture those

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,410
information that we still don't have

00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:22,220
much and also their art especially the

00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:26,220
drawing painting related to the culture

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:28,740
and then we will feed the information on

00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,470
this website and basically only two of

00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:35,190
us right now as a team to maintain in

00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:37,770
this website so as you can see we can we

00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,930
haven't done much because our skill are

00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:45,660
very limited and we don't have web

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:47,880
developer to support us of course like

00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,860
we are not just only two but we have

00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,110
more like indigenous network in the Asia

00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,760
region like indigenous people back we

00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,170
have a big network so I think to

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,030
maintain this a website we will not

00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,860
collected all information to post in

00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,440
this and we were launching this kind of

00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:04,320
work that we have done here this is the

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,850
thing that really we will do next how to

00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,880
maintain this kind of work thank you

00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:12,999
okay good thank you

00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,999
[Applause]

00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,960
right I guess maintaining a website like

00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,650
this as UNESCO would know is a big

00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,170
challenge getting all the data in and

00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,119
managing a lot of web administrator to

00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:28,309
organize and sort all this content is is

00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,500
a daunting task but very good

00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:34,369
presentation team okay

00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:39,770

the guac island is that right Queensland

00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:49,369
okay so we to have challenges with

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:52,780
languages there we go okay over to you

00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,780
team for minutes starting now

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,839
okay so however we are team gradual

languages okay so next week so now a

00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,609
brief is about our design idea it's a

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,319
it's all about exploring all the

00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:14,930
intention languages in the world

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,970
how some land leverage our system and

00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:21,280
rewards we also use first sushi

00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:23,930
iPod and quiz and findings also we have

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,220
friends that all sharing this is our

00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:30,920
main features so he's here our leveling

your own land okay so follow up for a

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,809
business model we have a travel agency

00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:44,359
and the indenture language project

00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:48,819
involved in our project in our

00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:51,530
application okay so low technical model

00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:54,020
we we use something wrong with low

00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:57,040
technical for a business model for the

00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:02,180
technical details we have really a I and

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:06,319
it is dynamodb IPS which you text html5

00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:09,500
and css3 progressive web app and nodejs

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:12,890
okay so looking forward we'll have some

00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:16,700
many features okay so yeah here I'm

00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:20,430
going to show you the Floyd version of

00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:23,119
our production is quite cool thing

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,119
yeah

00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:51,100
yeah okay so yeah our phone you can see

00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,860
a panda yeah actually we designed this

00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,800
logo buy us off because we the pendel

00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:59,260
and the inventor language we hope our

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,980
Africa also helped indigenous language

00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:06,580
as popular as panda yeah so when you log

00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:08,740
in you can be directed to a story page

00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:12,250
so every day we will post some random

00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:14,890
news and article about the endangered in

00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:20,290

every time will you level up we will try

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,260
to find a sponsor and we will actually

00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:36,780
interesting okay yeah and here is your

profile you can see the organization

00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,589
like in the future we are going to put

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,059
more organizations organization

00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:46,920
organization like we are going to have

00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:48,869
the partnership with so right now we

00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,359
only put us but in the future week we

00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,799
are going to put more and in the task so

00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,809
this is how you're gonna earn your

00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:59,760
points we have some quiz about the

00:47:54,809 --> 00:48:01,380
language so let's try the quiz and after

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,020
you finished quiz we will give you the

00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:08,720
points and then you compute more house

00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,720
and donate to the local organization

00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:23,440
do you have any question yeah yeah and a

00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,360
dad we have actually deployed to

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,960
production this in order to the positive

00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,960
development

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:40,240
any other questions from the judges

00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:40,240
please we want to test these teams

00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:52,210
so Oh for the database we use the

00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,249
dynamodb LRS dynamo TP is on OC :

00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:57,999
happens I think this is most flexible

00:48:54,249 --> 00:49:00,190
for our usage or user data and article

00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:03,579
and the language yeah I think it's very

00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:05,470
good for our progressive web basically

00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:07,089
also you see the our application is

00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,069
actually a website so we have

00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:10,989
scalability in mind so basically we can

00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:13,029
extend to different devices whether it's

00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:14,979
a mobile device which is iPhone or

00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:16,660
Android or anything else

00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:19,180
we're actually reaching out to a wide

00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,890
range of users who will benefit from our

00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,900
app and the indigenous languages were

00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,900
also benefit from our rewarding system

00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:30,539
okay thanks for that team :

00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,450
okay great quite a comprehensive and

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,210
functional demonstration with some

00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,680
interesting technologies at play I was

00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,690
also curious where all the language data

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,890
comes from because of course that needs

00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,650
to be pulled from somewhere and

00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:55,790
displayed accordingly and also hopefully

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,839
be accurate right so on to the next team

00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:59,270
and we've got lined up

00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:02,359
is that vernacular so vernacular is up

00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:06,200
for the judges vernacular and I think

00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:08,930
we're good to display that right right

00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,619
then let's start the timer for minutes

00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:15,650
hello everyone we have an ocular so

00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:17,329
first of all what is the vernacular we

00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,190
are making an application for the people

00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:20,839
of younger generation to get involved

00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:23,359
with the indigenous languages of the

00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:25,820
world so by the younger generation by

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,490
not the older generation first of all so

00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,470
the older generation they know that bird

00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:32,420
that nei they know the interviews

00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,760
indigenous language is quite a bit but

00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,770
the thing is due to the globalization

00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,020
you drew people going out of their local

00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,630
communities people are going towards

00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,280
English and languages like that to

00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,690
communicate with the foreign word that

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,030
this is the main reason why these

00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:49,040
languages are a bit diminishing so we

00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:52,520
want to involve the younger people use

00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,670
an application based on Susy and that is

00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,930
not just an application that is also a

00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:59,390
smart speaker based application that is

00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:02,599
also a voice application also so we are

00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:05,810
making a quiz game out of Susy that will

00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:11,300
help us involve more younger people into

00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:11,750
more local so we have used Susy iron low

00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,180
class

00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:17,540
so we have created our skills to

00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:20,210
generate a list of sweet a suite of

00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:22,520
games based on the indigenous languages

00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:24,349
that the user selects so like I wanted

00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:28,869
to play a game in Cree and we have

00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:28,869
created option selection game in Creed

00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:35,599
and as soon as the game is finished the

00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,910
high score is posted to Twitter this

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,510
makes a community through the low class

00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:43,450
and creates the community and the and

00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,230
connects the native speakers to the

00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:50,660
people who are still learning the

00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:53,300
indigenous languages so yeah between

00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,190
application building community out of it

00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,170
that's our main aim that's Amin into

00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,490
this application so what is them I mean

00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,079
achievement we have not just build an

00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,569
application we also built a skill that

00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,050
clearly that can be easily used by the

00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:07,460
natives that mobile speaker of Susy and

00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:11,180
even a small child can play this game

00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,069
this is so easy you can we mostly want

00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,559
to include more folk loads and

00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:17,660
everything that people have like you

00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,480
remember sitting on your grandparents

00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:22,130
lap when you were younger and listening

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,780
to the foreclose they used to say so

00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,450
this is like a family member you can

00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,280
easily access these things you can

00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:30,730
easily learn more about the indigenous

00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:34,369
languages for sure

00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,900
so obviously main thing we are making a

00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:39,770
better community out of every develop

00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:41,890
made better word out of them so thank

00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,890
you

00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,880
No okay excellent

00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,270
so we have created an iOS app with a few

00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,840
web views and we have used the local a

00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:03,250
KPI the Suzy the jad dot so 0 TI f and

00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,200
the Suzy city this data to create a

00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:08,320
custom skills and the games are

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,830
generated from native html5 and canvases

00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,830
and I think

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,910
another question from the judges

00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:25,700
about the gamification interesting

00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,700
concept

00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,890
Oh

00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,900
right now further indigenous languages

00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,820
there is not much open API are open data

00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:39,550
available so we had to see the data

00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:42,100
mostly and we are getting in a database

00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:45,040
where we are making a different list of

00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:47,230
words that will be used that that game

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,360
is based on that like specific word what

00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,220
is like what is an I increase that

00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,570
specific word it is so we are making a

00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:56,010
database out of it we are making the

00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:56,010
translations out of it that's how

00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:05,619
okay we're good so round of applause

00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:13,029
good thank you team Bunnicula it's an

00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:15,349
interesting take on mobile app

00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:17,959
gamification like the previous team

00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:19,489
making a bit interactive and using Susi

00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:23,059
AI so it's great to see these projects

00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:25,599
above for statio technology also okay

00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:31,640
next team is up and ready we team among

00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:36,469
right over to you okay we're a team man

00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:40,849
which means friends in catch in coach in

00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:43,219
expert join our team so so fundamentally

00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:45,709
the problem we're focused on is in these

00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:48,170
indigenous communities basically the

00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:50,059
children they have to learn the national

00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,199
language which doesn't give them that

00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:54,259
much time to learn the indigenous

00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:56,059
languages so how can the previous

00:54:54,259 --> 00:54:58,729
generation transmit these reading and

00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:00,349
writing skills in X generation so

00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:02,569
basically we want to build a game that

00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:05,660
can help the kids learn to read and

00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:07,039
write in the indigenous language so

00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,259
fundamentally the most important

00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,119
technical problem is the lack of data so

00:55:09,259 --> 00:55:13,249
we don't have lot of data in the richest

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:17,299
languages so problem we tackle is how to

00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:20,180
collect this data okay so here you can

00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:22,279
see Fuji expert actually recording his

00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,989
own voice samples so we deployed a

00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:26,499
website where they can record their

00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:30,829
voice samples in the indigenous language

00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:32,539
okay so the problem the AI problem we

00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:34,969
want tacko us how to train a speech

00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:36,920
recognizer for the Kachina language so

00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:41,059
many years our systems many languages

00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,739
probably none for kitchen right so what

00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:44,930
we want to do is we don't have love data

00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:47,630
in kitchen but could we use the English

00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:50,479
data sets and kind of fine tune for the

00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:53,660
kitchen language the solution we came up

00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:56,119
with is that they use different alphabet

00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,979
systems English in kitchen but if we

00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:00,079
translate everything to IPA the

00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:02,349
international phonetic alphabet then

00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:06,529
maybe we can transfer some of that data

00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:08,839
okay so we actually were able to do some

00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:11,119
training during the hackathon to do this

00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:13,699
on Saturday so their sets called timett

00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,199
it's open source they set about six

00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:15,559
thousand other answers four hundred

00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,329
speaker

00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:20,420
in English so the first step you

00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:22,939
transcribe it's IPA then we use PI torch

00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,549
and some open source to train our nen

00:56:22,939 --> 00:56:28,809
and just to show we actually ran it took

00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:30,920
about two and a half hours on GPU

00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:33,499
finally what we will actually do is we

00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,039
would take the kitchen samples and we

00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:39,259
try to fine tune the language model and

00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:45,439
use that language model to to create our

00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:47,329
SR in kitchen okay so so just briefly

00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:50,739
about how we prepare the data

00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:56,059
so first firstly we got our expert Fuji

00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:58,630
who speaks country and basically he gave

00:56:56,059 --> 00:57:02,509
us a bunch of words are catching birds

00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:05,989
and we we first have to try to translate

00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:10,359
it to fumes in C mu which is Carnegie

00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:10,359
Mellon University's phonetics

00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:19,720
thereafter we have a dictionary to

00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:21,849
transmit it back to IP so as you can see

00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:25,089
there there was like gold in means

00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:28,270
football manam which is our team name

00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:30,970
means friends and Singapore it's not

00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:33,339
Singapore it's that's the that's the

00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:37,230
right way to say it in Kachina and

00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:37,230
there's a term I

00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:42,070
thank you Sam

00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:45,740
always basically do

00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:58,000
so the game is like you have to say this

00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:59,859
word in caching so assuming that I don't

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:11,800
know anything catcher and I just go and

00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:15,849
then say something so I the hint button

00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:18,700
it says so when I try the hint button it

00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:22,150
says you should say Gordon so Gordon

00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:24,630
means football I would say then okay I

00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,630
say

00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:06,040
so it's actually like in the end it'll

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:13,980
pronounce what a Fuji ad said but it

00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:21,430
didn't work out okay very interesting

00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:23,710
topic is the code uploaded in github I

00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:26,490
think we have a github we can share the

00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,490
link so yes

00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,829
for the questions to catch in and

00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:43,420
what was supposed to happen after you

00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:47,140
say the word so in the demonstration but

00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:48,760
okay I think I think the point is if

00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,560
they can pronounce it we're in kitchen

00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,210
okay then I give them a point but if

00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,620
they can to say okay here's how you

00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,450
pronounce it and then we try to create

00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,370
their performance on how well they say

00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:59,740
the word so I can try to speak up yeah

00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:11,170
so using the AI to create the speaker's

00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:12,820
performance yes so yeah we trained a

01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:14,320
model for speech recognition and we

01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,450
still need to find tune so actually we

01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,040
were able to collect for speech for

01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:20,860
different speakers our speech samples

01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,600
I'm two from Emma and one in Thailand

01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,160
but obviously we probably need a little

01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,030
bit more they do a bit more time to kind

01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,030
of find you in the model

01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,840
any last questions from the judges

01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,130
okay I think the judges are happy I

01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:47,940
think our times up

01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:50,690
Thank You team okay I think we're

01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:53,580
looking forward to hearing some catching

01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,450
always novel to have everybody from

01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:57,030
different cultures with different

01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:59,810
backgrounds to and we can share that in

01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:02,880
the teams we have both you know students

01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:04,950
friends technical people non-technical

01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,960
people and even I guess family members

01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:08,310
participate so it's really bringing

01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,190
people together to come to the hackathon

01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:14,400
and spend 48 hours together turning out

01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:17,970
a product in a rough prototype over to

01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:21,720
the next team which let's make sure I've

01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:23,900
got information here is this team same

01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,900
rule

01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,810
here's a mic

01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,700
good afternoon everyone we'd like to

01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:39,530
present to you our project hazim which

01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,140
I'd like to go into length about why we

01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:44,180
named this if time permits at the end so

01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:49,780
I like to begin by introducing our team

01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:49,780
members my name is Anna my name is Nick

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,840
so first we'd like to talk about the

01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,520
situation at hand as you all know the

01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:05,380
indigenous languages across the world

01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:08,650
are decreasing rapidly as that's why

01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:12,859
UNESCO has declared 2019 a year of

01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:15,290
indigenous people and so for example we

01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:17,960
have a team member with us sue who's an

01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:20,780
indigenous perch Digitas person from

01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:24,380
Mayan Mar specifically the western part

01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:28,790
of my and Mar and as of now there are

01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:31,640
only 1.5 million speakers of her

01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:33,200
language which is a reckon ease and this

01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,359
may seem like a large number but

01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,300
compared to three hundred and sixty

01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,730
million speakers of English this is a

01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:43,490
drastic difference so in order to

01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:45,500
preserve their language languages such

01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:48,320
as Sue's we came up with the initiative

01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,690
in order to help fuel and preserve the

01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:53,840
languages and that is through our gaming

01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:56,270
application which I will hand to my team

01:02:53,840 --> 01:03:04,520
members Nick and lamb to talk more in

01:02:56,270 --> 01:03:07,310
detail about so we developed the idea

01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:10,970
and the problems that a lot of our

01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:14,890
competition actually faces is that when

01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:17,660
dealing with getting data for speech

01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:19,640
that we don't really have a lot of that

01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:22,190
for indigenous languages so we decided

01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,590
to gamify the collection of speech data

01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:27,590
for the use of other applications and we

01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:31,730
did this through adapting flappy bird

01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:33,170
and being inspired by that not connected

01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:36,980
Chrome dinosaur game

01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:40,070
I think not so the idea is that we have

01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,840
you have to speak to get the bird to go

01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:44,770
over obstacles and the obstacles are

01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,410
different objects that prompt

01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:49,630
player to say different things in their

01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:52,300
indigenous language and we record that

01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:54,880
and play it back and associate the

01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:59,460
obstacle like the image to what was said

01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,460
so demonstrate here

01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:30,380
all right so I'll try to turn down the

01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,849
volume a little bit so we don't blasts

01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:36,290
I'm not sure if this is actually

01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:39,890
connected to speakers at all but oh yeah

01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:41,780
so it the idea is that you press these

01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:44,450
buttons click on the buttons on the side

01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:47,390
and the audio that are recorded was

01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:49,579
actually played back and in the future

01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:52,099
we would extend this so that we would

01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:55,160
send these audio files to a remote

01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:57,109
database along with The Associated

01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,930
images so that they could be farther

01:04:57,109 --> 01:05:03,200
studied and used for machine learning

01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:06,200
models and then we would idea is that we

01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,119
made this game very easy to expand you

01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:11,210
can add in any of your own images and

01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:13,910
just you just provide the path within

01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:16,369
the code and you can just expand it to

01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,710
get whatever images you want and you can

01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:19,970
apply it to any given language it makes

01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,049
no assumption on whether or not the

01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:25,130
language actually has a written

01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:27,500
component so in addition to that that

01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,670
we're saying that our target audience

01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,790
for this app would be the indigenous

01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:35,480
people and it's a good way to help I

01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:37,819
guess taking their curiosity given the

01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,980
game that can take in their language

01:05:37,819 --> 01:05:41,690
record their language and preserve it

01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,579
for future datasets for maybe future

01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:47,150
linguistics or technologists who hope to

01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:49,490
use this data to fuel other definitions

01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:51,500
just in the future and although this is

01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:54,410
a game right now it seems like you can

01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:56,510
just you can just say something forever

01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:58,280
and then it'll stay up there we can have

01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,960
obstacles at the very tops and then

01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:03,799
you'll have to not speak and then

01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,750
whisper at some point in order to avoid

01:06:03,799 --> 01:06:07,860
the obstacles so it gets more complex

01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:16,230
but this is our basic rough draft

01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:19,790
okay thanks team Thanks over to the

01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:19,790
judges for one minute of questioning

01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:29,520
technology what what I using okay so we

01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:31,530
did we ended up not using any of the

01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,810
facio technology and we were going to

01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:35,760
try using the previously developed

01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:37,500
flappy bird game and that didn't

01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:42,030
cooperate very well with the microphone

01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:43,410
so we just used plain JavaScript we took

01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:48,350
a couple with open-source projects

01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:48,350
already to get the basic game physics

01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:53,570
Mario you have a question

01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,270
it's to a time for more question if the

01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:14,900
judges have nope we could okay toss in

01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:19,790
well done good presentation right so we

01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:24,620
continue on next team up is called an y

01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:27,650
jc-- I'm curious about the name yes good

01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:29,660
afternoon so our name is basically n y

01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:32,030
jc-- as you can see it's the name of our

01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:34,070
junior college so we decide to take on

01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:38,120
its name and hope for good luck

01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:40,790
so our project is very simple and its

01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,880
purpose I guess so it's up and running

01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:47,780
now so you can assess the your URL link

01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:52,430
if you would like to so yeah it's a very

01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:54,920
basic webpage that we web act that we

01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:58,220
used to promote and we raise awareness

01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:01,160
of indigenous languages so as you can

01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:04,520
see we have a Y page which basically

01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,010
show the reasons of statistics and what

01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,010
you can learn about the indigenous

01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:09,010
languages

01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,680
as you can see there's a learn more

01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:19,299
button because basically we're not

01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:21,040
expert in the languages ourselves so we

01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:23,589
have a little button that link to a

01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,890
webpage where we deem it's possible for

01:08:23,589 --> 01:08:32,500
the audiences to get their overview of

01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:35,640
the matter so yeah okay so we also have

01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:39,969
a language map which we painstakingly

01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:46,920
input the data of the it is genius

01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:50,049
languages yes so so if you click on the

01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:52,540
nation or the region on the map will

01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:56,770
show you what kind of languages there

01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:59,410
are in that area so yeah implemented

01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,120
both but as you can see we have not

01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:02,770
covered the map so that's kind of a

01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:09,310
point of improvement that we can

01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:11,259
implement in the future also what so

01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:16,810
basically the what page is where you can

01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:18,310
learn so here you can so it's a demo so

01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:21,540
I think I should pass the mic to my

01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:21,540
friend right here so you can

01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:33,160
so it's so we use Susie AI as the base

01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:37,109
because we think that languages are very

01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:40,839
dry we are students so we have no

01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:42,759
experience with languages so it's a very

01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:46,029
dry topic and we think that if you

01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:50,739
interact with a chatbot that's better so

01:09:46,029 --> 01:09:55,960
it has some skills to it so it's not the

01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:59,910
basic CGI that you find so we added some

01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,910
language skill to it so

01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:08,500
so when you ask a question like that so

01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:10,990
it will pass back an answer of language

01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:13,420
that we've already implemented so it can

01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:16,840
translate from I know to English I know

01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:21,220
it's a language of dizziness people of

01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:26,860
the northern part of Japan so it's a

01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:27,820
uncle in ru it's a cupful as it seems

01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:31,390
yeah

01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:32,590
so we also implement the random word if

01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,240
you want to know more about the word

01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:35,800
because we have four what list but

01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:38,440
apparently you no one's gonna browse it

01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:42,780
so if you want to random for like just

01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:48,810
for your own suffering you can actually

01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:48,810
ask for the random word yes

01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:58,610
or we also implement the fun fact so if

01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:01,130
you want to know like maybe a random

01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:03,890
fact just some small facts about the

01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:06,760
indigenous languages you can get it from

01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,760
City I also

01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:22,440
so yes also as you converse with your

01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:25,560
chat bot there are some times you will

01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:29,489
like sometimes your Curie will contain

01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,739
some like interesting work you know

01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:37,710
times up team okay

01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:40,409
well done in interesting demonstration

01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:43,580
of your different language aspects one

01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:43,580
minute for the judges

01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:57,470
so thank you I was wondering about the

01:11:53,770 --> 01:12:00,890
the language I'll do implement the

01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:03,350
language so I said no we only have I

01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:06,020
knew as our language so as you can see

01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:08,510
we have a language tap there so we

01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,380
intend to put more but of course of time

01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:12,170
constraint

01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:15,650
you only have one language as of now so

01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:21,380
we can translate from English back it's

01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:26,990
about how is it done it on the table

01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:30,560
translation it's basically the S key the

01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:32,090
nyquist it is stolen how he is a insider

01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,250
to theory so if you just basically

01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:38,170
extend one column to add for another

01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,170
language so yeah

01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:51,100
but the manual thing at this point we're

01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:53,290
just using it as a key value pair okay

01:12:51,100 --> 01:13:01,830
judges I think that's all the time we

01:12:53,290 --> 01:13:01,830
have for team and JC y JC so thank you

01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:09,130
okay yes there we go

01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:11,440
so as we progress through this we only

01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:14,980
have three teams left if they're all

01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,950
here very encouraged by all the teams

01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:22,450
that have come up so far let's have you

01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:23,800
come up and we are kadam yes okay team

01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:27,220
da dong we're gonna give you four

01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:32,200
minutes good afternoon everyone I'm from

01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:36,010
Laos actually we our team is a three

01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:38,710
plus I will talk I will share a little

01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:42,820
bit about the reason why we came up this

01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:45,670
idea in Laos we have the problem that

01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:48,550
price especially could more people in

01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:49,600
the in the community they don't speak

01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,700
Laos

01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:55,030
so when they go through school that's a

01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:57,870
problem that I dig it's hard for them to

01:13:55,030 --> 01:14:01,210
study and in the same time in the city

01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:06,460
remote people they can't speak more so

01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:09,610
that's why we create the apps so I will

01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:16,690
head out to my friend to talk more about

01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:19,270
this app thank you love yeah so now I

01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:21,910
want you to meet Noi she is a kamut a

01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:23,710
female and she gets the opportunity to

01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:26,440
actually learn English through our app

01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:29,110
at the same time she helps us build the

01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:31,360
English Camus dictionary to your right

01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:33,490
you can see Jane she's a tourist now in

01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,770
Laos and she finds it difficult to

01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:39,480
interpret the language so our app is

01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:39,480
actually going to help her do the same

01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:45,520
so let's highlight a problem statement

01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:49,870
in adequacy of online resources for

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:52,180
indigenous languages go dong so Goodall

01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:52,500
is basically a game we have designed to

01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:55,220
a

01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,480
the inadequacy of these online resources

01:14:55,220 --> 01:15:00,330
for Camus which is an indigenous

01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:03,450
language it helps provide translation

01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:05,460
facilities as well as the dictionary now

01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:08,130
we will have an online a demo

01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,200
ok so I'll do the first part and the

01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:12,420
first part is so we're authenticating

01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,940
with any social media right now it's

01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:18,060
Facebook and now we have two options one

01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:18,720
is play a game or two is look at the

01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,690
lexicon

01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:24,210
so we're gonna play the game and you get

01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:26,610
a word and you get the picture and you

01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:29,010
also get the Lao on right

01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:32,160
and because Camus doesn't have official

01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:36,420
text they're gonna type in Lao and so I

01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:40,110
have some just imagine a loco was using

01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:42,810
it they would type this and play the

01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:45,690
game and then it would go one by one and

01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:47,400
this is basically to give them

01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:49,440
incentives they get points for every

01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:51,450
question and there's a leaderboard that

01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,820
they can check where they're on that

01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:55,970
leaderboard so the more people play our

01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,920
objective is being reached which is

01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,630
getting more words which is an online

01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,390
right now and he's gonna talk about the

01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,950
lexicon okay so basically the words that

01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:06,660
we collect from the ad game are the ones

01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,790
that we are gonna use to populate a sort

01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:10,260
of online dictionary so we're kind of

01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:12,210
building a dictionary with these words

01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,770
that's gonna be open source and people

01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:15,210
from anywhere can use it like because we

01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,890
see that a lot of other developers and

01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:17,940
even people at UNESCO who are interested

01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,770
and you know working with indigenous

01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,630
languages and we think this would be a

01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:22,950
great tool for them so in addition we

01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:25,680
have also implemented a translate

01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:27,720
feature here so the words that we

01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,790
collected to build the database can also

01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,410
be used to translate by tourists or

01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:36,960
other people wanting to talk to people

01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:43,260
in control so it gives me the Camus

01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:44,640
translation for that so technically if

01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,320
you go to Google Translate you can't

01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,510
find this cuz all you can do is English

01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,180
to Lao Lao to English this is giving you

01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:52,560
English to Kabul and so it's we got this

01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:54,990
idea basically because we were speaking

01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,610
to law and she said that her indigenous

01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:58,620
language doesn't have an official script

01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:00,649
and this is supposed to be a fun way

01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:02,840
that you gather data that doesn't

01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:10,519
and the dictionary supposed to build and

01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:12,590
go and and yes and because of children

01:17:10,519 --> 01:17:14,570
they they can guess by pictures so

01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:16,459
that's why we came up this idea that has

01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:19,610
a feature and easy for children to

01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:23,479
understand too and again I want to talk

01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:26,179
more about quran why this earth means

01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:34,159
wrong I call Quran because Quran in como

01:17:26,179 --> 01:17:37,789
it quran eskimo language that we that's

01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:42,949
very popular for como you you can see

01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:46,010
every years we have a como new year so

01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:48,919
people share story and song around the

01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:51,820
quran it is very fun so that really

01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:59,139
represent to kamut so that's why it's

01:17:51,820 --> 01:18:05,809
well done team okay nicely presented

01:17:59,139 --> 01:18:08,649
okay actually using an online MongoDB

01:18:05,809 --> 01:18:08,649
storage and we're

01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:16,680
you have any more questions this is a

01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:18,690
progressive web app so it supposed to be

01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,090
a website that functions like an app and

01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:23,130
we're just showing it here on the

01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:27,710
website also that it's cross platform

01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:27,710
and building react using

01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:34,660
and where are you getting the English

01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:37,330
word from which translates from okay so

01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:38,830
essentially we kind of used a random

01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:40,240
word generator which gave us a lot of

01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,500
words and then we actually put it

01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,270
through Python doing parts of speech

01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,600
tagging to get like words we thought

01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:50,640
would be useful to translate and then we

01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,640
use that list to get the images and

01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:09,580
okay great team well done King Kong okay

01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:13,210
so for team go wrong and some really

01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:15,160
indigenous languages well put together

01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:16,810
with a small team to make it so

01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,610
functional and and demonstratable I

01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:20,380
think also important is the

01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:22,840
consideration for web technologies right

01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,250
and mobile technology in the context of

01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,810
these emerging markets right mobile

01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,120
first making these things mobile

01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:30,790
accessible the team that we're gonna

01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:33,550
bring up now is speaker from earlier

01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:35,500
from sim rule so judges just to make a

01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:42,400
note we're going to simmer from earlier

01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:45,970
and you got four minutes okay okay first

01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:49,810
off it's not pronounced sim rule it's

01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:53,680
Welsh and it's pronounced s Camry yes

01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:56,710

01:19:53,680 --> 01:20:00,460
talk about Welsh well Welsh is according

01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:04,120
to the UNESCO languages that is yeah

01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:07,660
kind of in danger is horrible so it

01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:12,540
could go in danger but it could also not

01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:16,660
go in danger but yeah so it's kind of

01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:20,680
going out of trend you know so Welsh

01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:23,860
it's a very interesting language so I

01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:25,660
have a solution for the promotion of

01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,220
Welsh language to make sure it does not

01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:30,640

01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:21,280
hilariously like like Wales is like you

01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:25,330
like that she does like an attack dog

01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:28,210

01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:31,300
like yeah it's calculus yeah its

01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:37,900

oh yeah entertaining so uh something

01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,680
more different and I guess experimental

01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:55,030
but making use of the unity framework

01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:57,310
for this rapid R&D and demonstration so

01:24:55,030 --> 01:25:01,990
um we're down to the last I think it's

01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:04,870
the last team indeed general opee I just

01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:07,120
want to ask easily is the last team

01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:14,080

01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:23,650
to them

01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:26,650
[Applause]

01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,650
microphone

01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:46,200
okay let's see to get this slide deck up

01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,200
here

01:26:00,919 --> 01:26:06,909
No so we're just gonna switch laptops

01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:06,909
make sure that comes up

01:26:08,809 --> 01:26:14,510
okay team I think for the sake of time

01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:19,340
I'm just making sure you get your four

01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:21,349
minutes okay so I hope that comes up at

01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:24,650
some point of time if no that's fine

01:26:21,349 --> 01:26:27,829
right so good afternoon everyone my name

01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:29,030
is Kritika Adrienne Anjali Sophia we've

01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:31,940
been working on this project together

01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:33,230
over the last three days oh well so as

01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:35,960
you can see we are a mixed race family

01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:37,520
my husband comes from Romania and my

01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,340
kids grow up with a strong sense of

01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,750
culture from both sides of the world and

01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:43,369
when we were trying to teach our kids

01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:44,869
Romania and we noticed something very

01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:47,829
interesting we noticed that there were

01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:50,840
there was a very high overlap between

01:26:47,829 --> 01:26:53,210
the words in Romanian and the words and

01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,800
many of the Indian languages for example

01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:56,570
in Romanian there is a word called

01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,489
dushman and the Indians over here would

01:26:56,570 --> 01:27:01,099
know that the word Dishman means enemy

01:26:58,489 --> 01:27:03,619
in Hindi at the same way there is a word

01:27:01,099 --> 01:27:05,449
in Romanian called pre attend and pre

01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:07,969
turn means friend and the root word for

01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:09,829
that is Priya which means somebody whom

01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:11,270
I love or a loved one and we were

01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:13,190
wondering what actually happened here

01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:14,960
why is there such a similarity between

01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:16,730
the two languages and in fact there are

01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,730
300 words in the Romanian vocabulary

01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:21,199
that come from Indian languages and we

01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:24,099
found out that this is actually because

01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:26,690
of the Roma people next slide please

01:27:24,099 --> 01:27:29,179
so the Roma people are basically gypsies

01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:30,770
and they traveled from India and they

01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:32,389
are now living in many parts of Europe

01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:36,349
they have a culture they're an

01:27:32,389 --> 01:27:38,599
indigenous group of people and and they

01:27:36,349 --> 01:27:40,309
are responsible for some of the

01:27:38,599 --> 01:27:42,260
similarities between the languages that

01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:44,210
my husband and I share and which is um

01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:47,000
which is important to the roots of our

01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:48,770
kids however we all know that the gypsy

01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,760
people because the Gypsy like lifestyle

01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:55,550
they are persecuted so next slide please

01:27:52,760 --> 01:28:00,770
okay so this is what we have done to

01:27:55,550 --> 01:28:06,170
help so we made a monopoly based game

01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:09,460
which has many different tiles and each

01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:13,130
of these tiles have a light sensor so

01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:15,500
you can detect which which player is on

01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:17,119
which tile so there's an adenine over

01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:20,579
here which controls all those light

01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:25,489
sensors this information is passed to

01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:25,489
the app and no

01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:40,420
okay so this is that it's part one there

01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:42,640
are two parts for this and we are gonna

01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:52,030
chat with Suzy we'll just click that

01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:53,830
button and so yeah the thing you are

01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:56,290
sometimes Suzy wasn't really behaving

01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:58,360
with us were you asking it whether it

01:28:56,290 --> 01:29:00,340
could tell us more about Romani which is

01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:04,260
what this feature of the app is mainly

01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:09,720
used for the second part of the app

01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:09,720
would be the game board so

01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:21,220
and in the game mode as my sister said

01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:24,670
players move along and it's connected to

01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:26,260
the web server so when these pieces they

01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:27,610
allow different amounts of light to pass

01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,470
through so the light sensors can detect

01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:31,570
them when they move over or give

01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:34,510
different numbers the web server which

01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:37,030
this app will then take so for example

01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:39,850
if a person lands on a forest towel

01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:41,680
they'll be able to buy it and for this

01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:44,260
we'll have to use points and these

01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:46,450
points come from the learning portion of

01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:48,100
the scheme where if they land on Zoo

01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:50,590
learns how they'll be asked a question

01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:52,600
and if they answer that question

01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:55,630
correctly they'll be able to get a

01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:57,580
hundred points this is a technology we

01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:59,950
have used we've used tangible for the

01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:02,650
app Python for the back end of the flow

01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:05,740
control Arduino for the game board and

01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:08,050
all the messy stuff back here Susie AI

01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:10,060
for the chat bot for the users to learn

01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:15,510
more and Python anywhere for the web

01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:17,530
server ok this is a very short

01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:19,510
implementation what we have done in two

01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:21,030
days we can extend it but I think a lot

01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:24,210
more information

01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:27,010
personalized Susie AI skills and

01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:28,990
implementing rich text format that can

01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:32,050
allow people from very different

01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:33,820
backgrounds to contribute with

01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:39,280
information based on their own

01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:42,070
indigenious languages children do not

01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:44,530
have ingrained prejudices therefore we

01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:47,410
have made this a game to expose them to

01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:49,660
different cultures early on in their

01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:56,220
life so that they can create a cultural

01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:56,220
bridge ok thank you

01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:09,770
well done then we also good for time so

01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:12,440
one more minute for the questions judges

01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:14,090
any questions the monopoly no questions

01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:23,150
but I applaud the kids for getting

01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:26,410
involved okay any last one more from

01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:32,930
Davide unfortunately we haven't seen the

01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:39,020
demo so it actually works pass the

01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:41,830
microphone so let's see if we can just

01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:41,830
play the audio

01:32:13,219 --> 01:32:18,820
okay let's just see if we can bring up

01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,820
this video

01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:28,000
audio out so we think the audio of this

01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:29,590
is going into the HDMI so yeah this is

01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,410
the first part of the video again with

01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:35,080
Susy ai my mom is asking it a few

01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:37,590
questions but I think the volume is dead

01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,590
on this laptop

01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:47,120
okay I think we're up for time so team

01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:55,310
thank you for uh for trying and really

01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:57,200
putting this together right it's a very

01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:59,540
interesting to learn about the spread of

01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:02,210
languages and going from from the

01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:03,920
subcontinent of India and finding words

01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:05,570
that end up in a different part of the

01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,960
world and I think that all speaks

01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:10,460
towards this this initiative of UNESCO

01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,400
to to give some attention to these

01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:17,660
indigenous languages so where we are at

01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:19,070
now is at very important juncture of

01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,650
this afternoon where we're going to be

01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:24,920
collecting feedback from the audience

01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:27,890
about your popular audience vote and we

01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:29,900
will let the judges adjourn for their

01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:32,570
votes just to take you briefly through

01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:35,330
it they'll be five different prizes and

01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:36,890
we'll recap that in a minute I'd like

01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:39,170
you to please to navigate to this

01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:45,740
website and cast your votes and the

01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:50,150
judges I'll let the judges turn first

01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:51,290
and withdraw for their consultation in

01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:53,660
the meantime for the rest of the

01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:56,570
audience we have some snacks outside so

01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:58,250
we can have a quick break and we look to

01:33:56,570 --> 01:34:01,730
regroup here shortly

01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:03,440
so we're slightly over time but let's

01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:08,350
make it in ten minutes and try be back

01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:08,350
