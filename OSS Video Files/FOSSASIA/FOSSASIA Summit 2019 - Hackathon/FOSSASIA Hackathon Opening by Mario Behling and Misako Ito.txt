Description: 
	15 March 2019 15:00, Event Hall 2-2 (Hack Stage)

Join the FOSSASIA Hackathon at the FOSSASIA OpenTechSummit with UNESCO, build awesome apps, games and personal assistants improving people's lives and tackling sustainable development challenges for indigenous people, and win awesome prizes! As part of the celebrations of the International Year of Indigenous Languages the hackathon takes place from Friday 15 March to Sunday 17 March 2019 at the Lifelong Learning Institute in Singapore.

We are specifically interested in applications and games, that tackle questions of indigenous people and their languages and solutions which could be replicated in other countries solving challenges for indigenous populations such as:

Localization, geolocation, Internationalization and multi-language search features of existing software, e.g. Open Event, Badgeyay, Badge Magic or any other FOSSASIA app
Implementation of new skills in different languages in voice applications and smart speakers
Solutions, apps or skills to increase cooperation around indigenous languages, e.g. implementing a website bot
Apps for learning or reading in indigenous languages using chat interfaces
Implementing translation tools, glossaries, e-dictionaries in a personal assistant
Solutions for providing greater access to scientific apps in indigenous languages, e.g. for Open Science apps like PSLab.io
Apps and experiments for promoting scientific knowledge in indigenous languages using different media, images, voice, audio, videos etc., e.g. using PSLab.io
Games solving questions and challenges related languages, indigenous topics, cultures and science
It is our goal to engage the developer community to develop innovative applications as open source by leveraging open data and knowledge-sharing. With the hackathon we support the dissemination of good practices with regard to indigenous languages and increase access to multilingual information and knowledge.

"Languages play a crucial role in the daily lives of people, not only as a tool for communication, education, social integration and development, but also as a repository for each person's unique identity, cultural history, traditions and memory. But despite their immense value, languages around the world continue to disappear at an alarming rate. With this in mind, the United Nations declared 2019 The Year of Indigenous Languages (IY2019) in order to raise awareness of them, not only to benefit the people who speak these languages, but also for others to appreciate the important contribution they make to our world's rich cultural diversity." (en.iyil2019.org)

We are inviting developers, designers, open source contributors, bloggers, journalists and all FOSSASIA community members to be part of the Hackathon. The hackathon is open for all and awesome prizes are waiting for you!

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,869
hack and continue hacking it and see

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,060

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,610
lot of people here so let's get started

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,930
thank you very much and welcome Masako

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:46,049
Ito from the UNESCO Bangkok office again

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,640
this opportunity for UNESCO to organize

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,920
with you the hackathon so this year we

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,720
are celebrating within the United

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,899
Nations the International Year of

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,560
indigenous languages so the topic that

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,469
we have chosen for this year is hack the

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,890
future preserving indigenous languages

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,420
through free and open-source software

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,900
so let me give you a little bit of

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,900
background I know that some of you

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,239
already attend

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,180
the debate so you are familiar but I

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,360
just want to share with you about a few

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,519
words about UNESCO why we are engaged in

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,950
this community with free and open source

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,069
community so UNESCO is a United Nations

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,590
agency which was established in 1945

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,500
after the Second World War

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,170
with a very very beautiful mandate to

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,120
create peace in the mind of men and

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:49,299
woman through education science culture

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,329
and communications and we have a very

00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:55,900
strong mandate for promoting culture and

00:02:52,329 --> 00:03:00,370
linguistic diversity and for also for

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,700
promoting access to to information open

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,129
access to information and so on so this

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,939
is why we have been working with the

00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:12,340
food Asia for already several years to

00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:14,739
support the community but also to work

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:21,190
together to organize this kind of

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:25,810
activities just to give you some figures

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:30,819
and fact about indigenous languages so

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:34,209
we have in the world over 6700 spoken

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:37,659
languages and half of them are in

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:41,109
dangers according to UNESCO we estimate

00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:43,659
us 90 percent of those languages could

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:47,530
not survive by the end of the 21st

00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:50,229
centuries and every two weeks we have a

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:54,430
languages that disappear from the word

00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:57,159
and together with these languages it the

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,409
culture the perception of the world and

00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,260
the identity of those people who speak

00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:05,530
the languages also disappear so this is

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:10,329
a very very important concern for UNESCO

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:13,560
and that's why we are we are we are we

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:17,229
we have lunch this year to engage

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,380
everyone in the world to think about the

00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:22,479
importance of protecting those minority

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,710
languages because those languages that

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:32,470
disappear most of them they are in

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:36,620
dizziness languages so the objective of

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:40,220
of this year is to remind us that

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,030
indigenous languages are the languages

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:49,310
of our world our time they are spoken by

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:52,479
over 370 millions people in the world in

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,340
almost 19 countries and they should be

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,490
safeguarding for cultural diversity and

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,620
we also through this year we also

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,050
encourage knowledge sharing and

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,780
development of language resources and

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,960
technologies and this is why we are here

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:13,160
for this hackathon so some of the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,699
example that we put together with force

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,940
Asia India in the announcement of type

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,979
of outcomes applications that you can

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,710
develop in relation to indigenous

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:29,389
languages could be localization geo

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,669
localization internationalization and

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:36,349
multi language search features of

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:38,690
existing software implementation of new

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:42,409
skills in different languages in voice

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,570
application and smart speakers solutions

00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:48,919
up or skill to increase cooperation

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,990
around the indigenous languages up for

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,979
learning or reading in engineers

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:58,639

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:09,020
access to scientific applications in

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:11,509
engineers languages up and experiment

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,449
for promoting scientific knowledge in

00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:18,320
indigenous languages using different

00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:21,020
media images voice audio etc and game

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,320
solving questions and third challenges

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:28,099
related to languages indigenous topics

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,590
and cultures so there will be mentors

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:34,279
