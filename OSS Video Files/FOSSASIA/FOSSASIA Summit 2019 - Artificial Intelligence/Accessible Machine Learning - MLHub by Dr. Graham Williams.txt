Title: Accessible Machine Learning - MLHub by Dr. Graham Williams
Publication date: 2019-03-27
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Artificial Intelligence
Description: 
	16 March 2019 17:10, Event Hall 2-1

An impressive array of tools and technologies for building artificial intelligence and machine learning models in R/Python is now available, and growing daily. Breaking into this technology is daunting. This talk will introduce and demonstrate an experimental concept of an AI and machine learning repository for openly sharing pre-built models and technology demonstrators. The repository (https://mlhub.ai/) is based around a command line pip installable tool, mlhub, which locally installs AI/ML packages directly from github (and other git repositories). Packages are downloaded, configured and demoed within minutes.
