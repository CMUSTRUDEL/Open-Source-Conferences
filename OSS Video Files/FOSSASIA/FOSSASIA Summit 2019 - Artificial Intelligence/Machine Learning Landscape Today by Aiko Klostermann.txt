When you have a data-centric problem to solve and you look for a technology to support you with this: The machine intelligence landscape can be overwhelming.

I analysed the landscape using a data-driven approach and condensed the outcome into a consumable form.

Additionally, I came to the conclusion that there is a set of questions you have to ask yourself to make the best possible choice for your situation.

This talk will cover these questions and present the analysis results on the basis of these.

TL;DR: With this simple talk you will know which framework / toolkit / library is best suited for your problem. Machine Learning Consultants hate him!
