There is a large number of deaf and dumb people across globe and communicating with them is difficult as not everyone can understand the sign language. There is also a lack of official sign language interpreters. In India the official number of certified sign language interpreters stood at merely 250 in the year 2017. This makes communication with mute people really difficult. Most of the teaching methods for deaf and dumb involve accommodating them to people without disabilities - while discouraging the sign language.  To make it easier for people to communicate with deaf and dumb people, I had attempted to use TensorFlow to interpret sign language. As of now the system can recognize only alphabets and work is in progress to interpret complete words. The talk will be divide in two parts. First is how TensorFlow object recognition was used to achieve the desired results. The second part will focus on how to contribute to the project and add localization (language specific signs) to make it more robust and more usable.

resume Vivek Khurana have come from

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,849
Delhi India and had been associated with

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:13,230
the open source in some of the other

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:16,109
form in past I have done some cool

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,289
contributions like the Drupal module and

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,840
I have few react native to react native

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:26,310
packages in the github which are

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,680
available so today I just wanted to why

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,779
I have came here is that before before

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,880
we get into the actual technology part

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,890
you know I would like you guys to

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,870
actually understand the problem that we

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,559
are trying to address so let us do a

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:47,219
small activity before we start okay

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:51,239
raise both of your hands okay

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,910
and now close down your ears as hard as

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,829
you can and now try to understand what I

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,360
am speaking even a one minute it was

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,719
very difficult for you to interpret what

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,840
I was speaking now imagine the life of a

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,330
person who has been who has who is

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,240
either born or has developed a hearing

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,450
disability how difficult it will be for

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,479
them to to have a normal conversation

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,299
with the society and the problem that

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,450
with whatever methodologies we have is

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,220
that all the methods expect the person

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,590
with disability to adopt recording to

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,320
the problem to the society instead of

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,750
society trying to find a way to be able

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,990
to interact with them yes there has been

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,390
an in past has been an attempt and one

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,439
of the most successful has been the hand

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,799
sign language

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,689
now although hand sign languages is more

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,700
or less a universal mechanism to

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:50,100
communicate but it has its own issues

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,560
now one of the major issues is that it

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,990
is not easy to learn no it's not

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,619
possible for people like you and me to

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,229
be able to learn it so easily and while

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,439
and most of us are also not interested

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,820
why why should we gordon get into it we

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,750
want to learn foreign languages but

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,250
that's okay and it is very difficult to

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,510
find the interpreters also so i was

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,300
reading on the internet it's not a

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,890
verified

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,520
number but I read it somewhere on the

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,280
internet that in year 2017 there were

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,940
only 250 certified hand sign

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,330
interpreters in India now imagine India

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:35,530
a country of 1.2 billion people had only

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:38,320
one have 250 certified interpreters so

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,330
this is if we look at it it doesn't seem

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,090
to it but it's actually a very deep

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,860
problem I mean if if highly populated

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,300
country has the situation imagine the

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,950
countries which are not so developed and

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,060
have lesser populations it will it is

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,750
almost next to impossible so how do we

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,740
fix this so how it all happened is that

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,370
one fine day I was actually thinking

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,170
what can I do in ml and all and so my

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,990
wife happens to be a special educator

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,490
she works with the children with special

00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:14,980
needs to educate them in all so during

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,810
one of the conversations or topic came

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,420
up with people with hearing disabilities

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,790
and and it was like it is very difficult

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,500
to understand so how do we do and when I

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,209
looked at it carefully I realized that

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,190
it's actually a good problem to solve

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,290
using machine learning because although

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,940
we have interpreters today have

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,280
real-time interpreters which can

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,470
translate from Chinese to English from

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
Hindi to English to English to any other

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,239
language but why not for this language

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,890
we have character recognizers we have

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,870
speech recognizers we have gesture

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,910
recognizers everything is there but

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,520
there is no concrete solution which I

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:53,530
could find so I started looking around

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:56,050
initial it was initial days of earlier

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,270
2018 I started to look around mostly

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,360
working it on it over the weekends

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,580
whenever I could find time but couldn't

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,310
find any solution which was closer to it

00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,950
initially then I thought let's start

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,930
using neural networks to solve the

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:15,550
problem so what I started out as how

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,680
people generally would start doing and

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,390
process trying to solve it I try to take

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,960
it as an image classification problem

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,610
now for for those who are not aware of

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,590
the image classification problem is

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,160
basically it helps you take a bunch of

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,520
images

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,650
and then either you know classify it in

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,080
a certain category that you know this is

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,220
an animal this is a human this is so you

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,380
can do that kind of an image

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,510
classification problem thinking that at

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,220
least let's start with alphabets I will

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,290
be able to classify the alphabets and

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,360
then move on to join those

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,300
classifications to come up with words in

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,530
sentences and all that we do and maybe

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:56,410
add some grammar to it at a later stage

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:59,560
but yes it worked initially for certain

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,390
alphabets but for certain alphabets it

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,310
was not working out especially like

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,830
alphabets like C so C is represented

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,680
like this in in hand sign language this

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,020
is C now the problem with C is and I'll

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,150
I'll show you guys on if time is there

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,570
on the on the demo also it never know a

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,070
finger could be a little straighter you

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,500
know for example if when I do this the

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,430
default poses this my pinky finger is

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,140
not curled it is straightened and there

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,790
are other things that somebody might do

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,250
see like this somebody might do like

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,200
this and and and at times because of

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,450
camera angles it might not appear curled

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,100
also in camera so those were the

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,680
practical problems that I started to

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,120
face and you know initially didn't work

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,080
so I thought probably it's not a good

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,810
problem and I stopped working on it and

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:56,020
then about a month later I was going

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:58,000
through something and so and while I was

00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,590
doing this I also came across that there

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,330
are other issues in hand sign language

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,790
that because based on certain regions

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,290
more words can be added then right is

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,840
more like Japanese in Japanese you can

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,660
add more words to the language you can

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,910
create your own words if you want so so

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,060
based on certain regions you might have

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,650
specific words and at times there are

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,180
words which are represented by a

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:24,940
specific gesture not just alphabets so

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,390
looking at it so imagine training just

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,860
if even if I take just 26 alphabets for

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,710
those who have actually done machine

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,410
learning you don't get results with 100

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,060
or 200 images if you want to have a

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,289
prediction and when you are actually

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,440
trying to talk you want to have a

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:42,570
prediction of over 90% you know

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,250
addiction or an interpretation which is

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,040
very close to the human intelligence and

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,800
that actually requires lots of images

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,590
you know a lot of couple of images that

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,020
which are required so one of the

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,660
attempts which was done by one of the

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,110
students who happens to magazine also

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,990
was that he took he took blender and he

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,970
started animating now he defined blender

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,830
animations and he said let me animate

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,640
and generate more and more images out of

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,680
it and then we try to train it but it's

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,280
although we were able to get close to

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,680
the the numbers but it was still the

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,360
problem was how will we add more

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,200
alphabets to it how will we add more

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,210
words to it

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,000
that was increasingly a problem because

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,570
training our neural network is not an

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,070
easy task it takes time it takes a

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,960
computational power to train a neural

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,800
network and the size of neural networks

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,170
is huge now imagine I train a neural

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,090
network based out of India on

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,630
interpreting and somebody in Singapore

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,520
wants to use it what will happen I will

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,900
have if there are I will have to train

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,450
it for the according to the local

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,040
dialect yes I will have to and then the

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,260
whole data has to be transmitted also

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,210
back to that specific phone or the app

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,150
has to be whatever is there has to be

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,530
updated and my actual target is that I

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:08,190
want to come up with an Android app that

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:10,650
can do this so I kept trying so one day

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,210
as I said when I was not getting good

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,460
results I stopped working on it for a

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,750
while and then one day I came across a

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:21,480
blog post on medium which was trying to

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:24,720
estimate the hand poses and going

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,030
through that hand paw that blog post I

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,100
can I came across some other research

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,180
work done by a couple of people not

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,039
couple of people but couple of

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,960
universities where they actually used a

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,360
combination of a neural network and a

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,390
Cartesian geometry to be able to

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,979
understand what exactly the pose is

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:46,470
right now so if you cannot understand

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,490
it's like how many of you are here aware

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,900
of Poe's net we across came across

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,730
posing it

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,610
suppose rate is is this neural network

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,930
so I am sure some of you would have seen

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:02,640
these virtual clothed trial equipments

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,770
where there is a mirror on front of you

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,080
stand when you stand and you can just

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,610
try whatever clothes you want and even

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,740
though you move around the everything

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,210
moves around with you so that's that

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,860
comes from a neural network which has

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,590
been trained by a couple of universities

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,170
a research community and is known as

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,880
paws net so how do you work in neural

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,100
network is basically you train these

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,960
networks and why you suddenly see this

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,670
burst of AI and neural network is

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,440
because there had been good framework

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,900
and good datasets which have been

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,400
released so so there are some of the

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,900
famous networks were available networks

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,800
which is pose net and then there is

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,110
mobile net there's cocoa so and then a

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,910
famous is inception from Google which

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,400
has a collection of huge libraries which

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,050
can be used for object detection but if

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,210
you look at closely it is not a just an

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,450
object detection problem it is it is

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:57,330
more or less to be able to identify the

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,510
specific pose so going through it I

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:04,380
found some more links which which are

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:09,210
there so these were the two links this

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:11,730
one is actually a first useful thing

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,760
that I found this was this was one link

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,400
which which is a research by some German

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,160
University I think it's German if even

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,050
if I am wrong sorry which has they have

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,440
published a paper and they actually used

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,390
what they did is they used Cartesian

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,910
geometry so Cartesian geometry is

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,350
geometry in three dimensions generally

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,360
the geometry that we study in school is

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,100
only two dimensions x and y but

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,590
Cartesian geometry adds the third

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,960
dimension so now I have a have a

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:43,410
solution that I can identify the posture

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,630
of the hand I can identify the finger is

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,230
going up or going down or going vertical

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:52,200
or it or is it curved so I am able to so

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,390
with this I am a if I look at just if I

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,070
get a picture like this the the network

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,470
will be able to identify that okay this

00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,720
is a hand these are for my five fingers

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,580
and on top of it using Cartesian

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
geometry you can figure out that you

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,340
know this finger is curved this finger

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,870
is pointing up

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,420
this finger is pointing diagonally and

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,400
that majorly solved one of the major

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,140
that's a rote moment of Europa because

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,590
that majorly solved the problem that I

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:21,110
was trying to solve so this was actually

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:25,230
the guest post by a guy called Prasad PI

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:29,400
he he'd he had done some work based on

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,320
work of these guys and trying to I am

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,030
sorry you if you were expecting I I can

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,890
show you the code also the the code is

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,420
already checked in in the jet jet have

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,450
been all and I'll show you the sample

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,950
also no it's lit actually very difficult

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,500
to show because these neural networks

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,200
these are like big files no 600 400 MB

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,450
files so these are all trained networks

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,550
which have been trained or so when I

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,650
started looking at it I actually found

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,200
that that a lot of work has been done in

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,480
this and my approach was correct that

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,980
whoever has been able to work on it has

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,020
been able to work on it by trying to

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,450
identify the pose which the hand is

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:08,490
using instead of you know just using

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,950
images to identify if you go to this

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,590
link you'll find a lot of things so

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:19,800
Eric's papers which has done lot of work

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:22,680
and then this guy will point you to the

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,600
data files which are which are used and

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,070
on those data files will find lot more

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,450
connections I will show if I can I'll

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,490
show you lot more data sets which have

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:39,750
been trained which can be used put to

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:42,150
other usages so this guy actually so and

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,970
this is this is like a master list of so

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,310
there are lot of networks which have

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,100
been developed by various universities

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,900
in you and others a lot of research has

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,690
already gone into it and there are

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:58,200
specific formats all have been designed

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,570
so this was basically the research which

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,160
has which I had which had gone in and

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,530
now based on it yes I was able to

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,540
identify but I had to work I had to get

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,890
this to work so yes there was this

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,110
solution which was able to identify

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:13,700
poses this solution which was able to

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,470
identify poses but they were not labeled

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,960
know so still the work was there that

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,390
not only we have to identify poses and

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,610
label them the second problem which came

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:27,630
across was they were working on static

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,870
images but I have to get it done in real

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,630
time so then again the the next bunch of

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,220
problems came in that we have to do it

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,460
in real time and you know trying to

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,130
interpret real time moving objects

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,430
changing poses is is not that much

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:48,470
straightforward if you try to do it I

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:51,390
mean anybody here has worked on open CV

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,150
so if you try to put open CV and try to

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,670
do a or network analysis while in real

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,130
time just see the FPS rate how it drops

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,930
badly so yes we had to look into certain

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:05,190
other solutions like trying to come up

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:08,760
with reading and all to be able to get

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:12,860
this to work but finally luckily in

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,960
January this year we managed to get some

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,420
breakthrough so we were able to identify

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,460
this is this is a short I just took

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,680
sitting here that's why I got late I

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,820
just thought it's better to take a short

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,500
sitting here so this is B D so that's

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,610
however a we are right now able to

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,290
identify most lot of alphabets yes it

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:40,500
says right now a work in progress and

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:42,750
what I what I need now is is basically I

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,220
need help from you guys because the

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,130
reason of speaking out here is that you

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,990
guys are from different countries I want

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,320
help from you guys to be able to if you

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,300
can connect me to NGOs or institutions

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,390
or any other project working in your

00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:03,900
country which wants to work for people

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:05,850
with hearing disabilities I need okay so

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,500
actually initially I got a message my

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,930
talk is 20 minutes but I realize it's

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:15,330
listed for 40 minutes I prepared for 20

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:17,730
minutes only so so I want help from you

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,750
guys to connect me to such organizations

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:24,150
who are trying to work with them and

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,910
that way because I want lot of local

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,160
information on on what kind of words are

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,950
there what how the local dialects work

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,210
yes I am also looking for volunteers to

00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,880
help me out

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:39,450
the the opencv based Python code is

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,670
there I will share the link but there's

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:45,180
an all I am also working on an Android

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,800
app Android and iOS app that's little

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,990
bit stuck I wanted to show a demo but

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,690
you know I'm having certain problem in

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,320
converting the existing tensorflow

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:58,470
models to the tensorflow lite models

00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,180
which are used on android so that is

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,700
also a work in progress so I am looking

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,430
for people who are willing to contribute

00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,530
in terms of adding more words in terms

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,810
of improving the existing software and

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:16,710
in terms of taking building a better

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,570
user interface I also working on a web

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,740
interface from which which I can give it

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:26,340
to the NGOs who want to work with it and

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,110
from where people can add more tools so

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,570
there is a small tool also which I have

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,270
developed which which basically takes a

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,730
video so if you want to add a new guest

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,710
share that workflow has been worked out

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,080
that you can take a picture shoot a

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,090
short video about about 30 second long

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,860
video if we can shoot with some noise

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,370
noise as and you will have to move hand

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,530
and all so based on that we can train a

00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,230
neural network to be mapped to a certain

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,820
word on an alphabet in terms of

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,680
contribution technical contribution

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,800
where I need most help is that there are

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,590
certain gesture there are certain words

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,530
or certain alphabets which are which are

00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:08,400
not science per se which our guests

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:14,670
choose for example Z or Z as we say it

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:17,400
in English is like this so what we need

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,580
also is not just the not just the

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,200
identification of the word there are

00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,900
there is a complex problem still left

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,420
before it this solution becomes a usable

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,210
solution is to be able to add gesture

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,990
control gesture based interpretation to

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,460
it which which should be not that much

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,220
of a difficult problem for somebody

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:42,720
who's passionate to solve it yes I have

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,580
certain ideas so that's more or less

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,730
about it what I wanted to introduce any

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,179
any

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,280
questions any suggestions you guys have

00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:53,080
see connect again connectors again that

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,179
is get sure recognition that has to be

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,520
built because see when I started off I

00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:00,160
didn't real I even I didn't know sign

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,140
language and as I kept on developing I'd

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,919
realized that yes there are other issues

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,990
and there are certain words in terms of

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,720
alphabets it's only Z which is like this

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,160
other all other alphabets are static but

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,380
yes there are words which are which can

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,270
be added in in other languages in other

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:20,890
dialects which which can basically track

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,370
which which basically make it a little

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:26,530
bit difficult to track on static images

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,080
and we need to have those kind of great

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,540
stir controls but yes using neural

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,080
network you can actually trace you can

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,360
track the movement but the thing is that

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,669
it has to be the robustness is required

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,210
because when somebody is speaking if you

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,620
have ever seen somebody talk

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,780
communicating in hand sign languages

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,360
they do very fast because it for them it

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,370
is like speaking how we are speaking so

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,940
they do it very fast so that processing

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,580
has to be handled in in a in a super

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,620
fast way that you know or maybe we can

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,309
tell them to slow down a little bit that

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,650
is still okay so once we are able to

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,790
crack more and more alphabets then we

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,610
can actually plug in into other

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,280
translators and things like this a text

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,559
to speech or speech to text kind of a

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,090
model where you know the person is

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,210
speaking and you simply point an app to

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:25,330
it and they are able to talk back so

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:27,370
that's that is why but to be able to

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,669
reach that level as I said we need to be

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,799
able to build the whole database first

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,480
right now yes whatever words or space be

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,520
safe basic things I could come up with

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,410
though is okay that we can but we need

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,809
somebody who's we need people who are

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,150
experts at it and can add it and yes

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:48,309
once it is done then analyzing of video

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,990
is is not a difficult task at all it's

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:53,530
like you know you just have to stream

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,990
pipe stream from a video instead of a

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,850
camera and the network will take care of

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,539
it

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,639
so not the knot I would say I haven't

00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,649
done the the what you are suggesting but

00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,330
what I have tried upon is there are

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:08,970
certain YouTube videos that I could find

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,980
out in which the communication was

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,840
happening in this language and try to

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,149
interpret it and that is actually where

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,619
try started to find out what are the

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:20,340
issues in my solution one of the major

00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:22,799
issues right now is that it is slow it

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,419
can be speed up I am looking into it

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,700
ways to be speed up because yes there

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,070
are object detectors like Yolo and all

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,990
which are very fast now you know they

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,629
can not only can identify the object

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:37,740
they can identify the speed of the at

00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:39,840
which certain object is moving so that

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,610
all we are looking at it at right now

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,350
what I have is a basic framework which

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,480
is there the basic problem which I am

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,759
trying to solve yes it can be improved

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,559
and that's why I am looking for

00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:56,700
volunteers to help us out contributors

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:59,539
not volunteers any other question okay

00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,539
