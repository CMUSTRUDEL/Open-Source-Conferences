At I/O 2018, Google released the Firebase ML Kit which creates various exciting opportunities for Android Developers aiming to build smart apps without having to worry about the nitty-gritties of Machine Learning.

The Firebase ML Kit APIs offer features like face detection, text recognition, object detection, etc. Your apps can also label a provided image for special characteristics and identify popular landmarks in a picture.

In this talk, I will outline the usage of all the 5 APIs available in Firebase ML Kit and Iâ€™ll be doing so by using a sample app that utilizes these APIs.

I will be walking you through the working of each API and you will leave the talk having sufficient knowledge of the APIs to go ahead and implement them in your own apps.
