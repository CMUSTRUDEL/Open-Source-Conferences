	15 March 2019 16:05, Event Hall 2-1

At I/O 2018, Google released the Firebase ML Kit which creates various exciting opportunities for Android Developers aiming to build smart apps without having to worry about the nitty-gritties of Machine Learning.

The Firebase ML Kit APIs offer features like face detection, text recognition, object detection, etc. Your apps can also label a provided image for special characteristics and identify popular landmarks in a picture.

In this talk, I will outline the usage of all the 5 APIs available in Firebase ML Kit and Iâ€™ll be doing so by using a sample app that utilizes these APIs.

I will be walking you through the working of each API and you will leave the talk having sufficient knowledge of the APIs to go ahead and implement them in your own apps.

at the next speaker is a Harshit he will

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:10,290
tell us more about firebase machine

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,969
learning kit our quick question

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,830
quick show of hands how many of you you

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,299
guys are mobile developers any mobile

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,529
developer in the house nobody'd ever

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,359
working an Android iOS all right

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,769
and how many machine learning experts

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,510
here I mean expert doesn't like you have

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,250
been working on ML projects since quite

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,769
a while and I mean you know how your

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,990
stuff okay a better question how many

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,279
people or people in the room right are

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,469
not really a very experienced with

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,719
machine learning as in like you are

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,040
fascinated by the idea of it but somehow

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,059
like you are elected to try it because

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,379
of the math involved because of the

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,219
statistics involved and all those things

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,590
so how many people in here okay I'm in

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,360
the right room make sense all right so

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,300
uh today I'll be talking about firebase

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,010
ml kit right so it's like modify the

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,420
title a bit so it's not exactly machine

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,010
learning maze made easy it's mobile

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,379
machine learning made easy because as

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,940
time progresses the laptops or the

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,539
devices that we use right are getting

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,660
smaller and smaller

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,489
right so our mobile phones the things

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,900
that they can do today even a computer

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,510
would not be able to do those things

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,220
feed us back by eight so tech is getting

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,020
more and more mobile right we have

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,000
smartwatches income upcoming time we

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,490
might have small chip implants as well

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,979
right so right now the fight is to

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,990
implement machine learning in a smaller

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,240
form factor as you can right so that's

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,229
the crux of my talk today right I will

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,210
be talking about how you can implement

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,890
machine learning in mobile even when you

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,430
are not a expert machine learning

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,500
developer right so yeah so about me I'm

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,150
an Android developer right so I work in

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,829
a start-up in New Delhi

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,000
that's coding blocks right I work is an

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,729
Android developer and an Android

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,430
instructor right and I'm also an open

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,530
source enthusiastic I'm I love to work

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,700
on open source technologies and tools

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,170
and yeah ok so machine learning as a

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,630
mobile developer now you can replace

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,540
this as a web developer or as a non ml

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,060
developer right so this is what you see

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,979
if you go on to an online course right

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,939
by Andrew ng you this is this is what

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,399
you see because this is an actual

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,530
snapshot from one of the deep learning

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,360
initiatives the course that end range is

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,250
recently launched right so I tried doing

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,800
that course right I stopped at the slide

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,450
right so I mean this is this

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
this was my expression right so it's

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,740
some sort of elvish like I mean I used

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,090
to learn these things back in high

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,890
school and college but I mean as you

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,660
start working as a software developer

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,270
this is like you really encounter these

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,890
things right so summation integration

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,390
theta alpha beta gamma all those things

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,650
we don't really use them in our daily

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,600
lives but for as a machine learning

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,340
engineer all the courses that you have

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,660
online they start with these things

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,680
right I'm not saying this is not

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,030
important it's important but it's

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,970
overwhelming right when you start right

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,190
so yeah so this is me right when I start

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,180
so what to do because I mean machine

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,980
learning is going to be the future right

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,150
and you need to know because if you want

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,920
to so there are the talk today morning

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,080
so how machines are going to replace

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,460
your job as coders so if you are

00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,380
concerned about your well being and you

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,810
want to earn money when you get old I

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,060
mean I'm not that also I'm still have my

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,440
life right so when you get old if you

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,720
want to earn money then you have to

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,310
modify yourself right if like learn new

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,570
things keep on learning so how should

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,190
you do that right so machine learning is

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,630
one answer but again what to do machine

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,460
you have to do all these things which is

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,260
sort of for like a feedback loop that

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,780
you cannot get out of so yeah so what to

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,330
do so this is something that can help us

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,040
get out of the loop right so the title

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,410
of the talk or the crux of the talk will

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,030
be implementation right so I have a

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,860
practical person right I am more

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,540
interested in practical implementation

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,010
than theory and a lot of course online

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,020
they focus on theory apart from few

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,370
courses like fast AI other courses that

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,440
you see online are more focused on

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,940
theory not that that's wrong but I'm not

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,140
cut out for it right because I love

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,140
practical things more than theoretical

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,300
things right so yeah so if you are like

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,590
me if you like to make things and learn

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,450
by making those things are all in

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,550
learning stuff and then making things at

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,950
the very end so this is something that

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,250
can help you buy it so who knows about

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,020
five is five is anyone so firebase is

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,270
basically basically a product built by

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,130
Google it's around mobile developers

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,020
right so this used to be back and L

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,790
service but now they have like grown

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,020
their product stack and they have a lot

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,000
of functionalities available right so

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,380
you can implement or thin your app you

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,400
can send notification you can do some

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,290
sort of machine learning stuff on your

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,730
apps right and ml kit was recently

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,739
announced at Google i/o 2018

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,269
right and this allows you to implement

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,390
machine learning features in your app by

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,450
both offline and online like so yeah so

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,400
we can use this to do some practical

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,460
hands-on learning right and get the joy

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,410
of

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,180
machine learning right so I think that's

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,819
a very common philosophy that I like to

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,289
follow right so we do something only

00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,560
when there are two motivating characters

00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:40,479
so first is money second is we feel like

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,060
doing it or we get joy by doing it right

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,919
so let's say we are working in at a

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,870
nine-to-five job right so either you are

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,220
motivated by your work you find joy in

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,020
doing your work or you getting money

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,970
right apart from that there's no third

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,349
factor and if I'm learning machine

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,819
learning right so I'm not getting money

00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,289
for doing that right I am paying money

00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,720
to learn machine learning from an online

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,070
or an offline source so the only second

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,289
factor that can motivate me to learn

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,009
machine learning is if I'm enjoying the

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:07,300
process and if I have to like solve

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,690
differential integral equations all day

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,759
long

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,250
definitely that's not a joy for me right

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,870
so yeah so building stuff that's how I

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,970
get joy right that's something that's

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,960
interesting that intrigues me so yeah

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,849
yeah

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,430
that is why tribe is that's something

00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,870
that ribosome will get allows so

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,990
firebase is basically it was announced

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,630
at Google by in Google i/o 2018 right it

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,009
has some pre-built api's that let you

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,020
perform some basic machine learning in

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,389
financing and it also allows you to host

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,750
a custom tensorflow module right onto

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,759
firebase and yeah so and iOS as well it

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,770
supports both Android and iOS

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,750
and I think web support is still in

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,139
works right so probably in the upcoming

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,469
future ml kit would also support web

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,599
apps right by using tensorflow jas okay

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,580
so what all do you need to start if you

00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,560
want to use five SML kit right if you

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,820
are just learning then you probably do

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,289
need these things so for example you

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,940
don't need an app or an idea that needs

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:04,570
so shilling features so you can simply

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,370
start by so you need to know basics of

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,650
pipe in a tensor flow this is optional

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,539
right later on not right now to start

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,430
you just need to know basics of app

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,639
development right because right now it's

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,650
not available for web apps but it's only

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,900
for mobile apps so you need to know the

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,639
basics okay so how how does like how do

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,889
Android apps work how do i OS apps works

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,909
you need to know basic Java Scotland all

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,900
those languages right so that's

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:27,789
something that you need to know and

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,830
that's it right rest of the things you

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:33,490
learn as you start exploring the API you

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,289
are playing around with the API so what

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,360
all the available API is are so first is

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,889
the text addiction you can detect a text

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,840
from an image second is face detection

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,000
you can detect faces emotions

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,470
sheÃ­ll contours all those things it also

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,720
allows you to scan barcodes and extract

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,220
values from them right it has image

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,440
labeling if you are available that sort

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,610
of takes an image and get some info from

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,110
that image

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,940
it also has landmark recognition API

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,979
right so for example you take a picture

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,169
of a famous place it tells you what that

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,449
place is right without using the

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,370
metadata of that image lastly again it

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,650
allows you to host and around custom

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,850
tensorflow models right let's say ok

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,380
we'll see that example later on let's

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,740
say I want to make an app that detects

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,900
whether object is the water bottle or is

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,310
that a pen right so I can train a custom

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,729
decibel model I can host that on

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,190
firebase

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,240
and Phi base will allow me to like use

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,889
that model as well

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,710
so it's very flexible in that regards

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,660
right so the first five API is a that

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,040
you see our custom pre-built ApS that

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,570
you cannot week or modify but the last

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,590
one you can tweak and modify it to your

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,600
own content right so there are two types

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,820
of API is again so first is on device

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,780
API so that runs on your mobile right it

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,580
doesn't require an internet connection

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,500
it doesn't require anything else it runs

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,000
on any mobile phone right it runs

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,130
without an internet so for the next

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,590
billion so this was a like very popular

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,240
tag pushed by Google so supporting or

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,810
building for the next billions because

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,270
recently in India we got geo right so by

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,470
the like inception of Geo more than a

00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,720
billion people came online for the first

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,280
time so we kind of build apps for them

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,110
or you want to build features for them

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,690
so you they have to be tailor-made and

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,669
custom-made for them right but the

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,440
corner of this on device API is that it

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,520
has a low accuracy if the accuracy is

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,160
lower the results that you get are

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,190
limited right but it also has the cloud

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,870
API that's paid but again for the first

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,800
thousand calls per month it's free so

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,720
let's say you're playing around with the

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,389
API you don't need to pay anything right

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,729
it needs an internet connectivity so

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,260
that's the rest billions right and it

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,300
has higher accuracy obviously because it

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,740
runs on Google Cloud right it uses

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,390
modules that are trained on Google Cloud

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,669
and all those things okay so let's jump

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,080
directly into the action part of it like

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,849
I will show you some code snippets I'll

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,560
show you some working examples of how I

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,630
played around with the milk it and build

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,800
some apps right some of those apps are

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,570
live on Google Play Store people are

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,580
using it and yeah that's all these

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,110
things are done within a time frame of

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,390
let's say for three to four months right

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,580
so I was not in I am NOT an ml expert

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:58,660
right but again I learned thing

00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,460
by doing them right and yeah so first

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,860
this texture condition right so again so

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,270
so on the left side you see the API and

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,880
on the side right side you see an

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,890
example app built that uses this API

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,300
right so for the text recognition API

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,870
I built the credit card scanner app

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,830
right so you see this in many apps for

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,540
example you're using PayPal right so

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,710
PayPal if you want to enter your card it

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,240
asks you to scan your card

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,950
it already takes the details from your

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,350
card and that's it so I made a clone of

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,420
it using firebase text recognition API

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,060
so just take a picture of the card it

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,660
will recognize the card number and the

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,520
expiry date

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,620
it gives me other things as well it

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,540
gives me this city rewards and all those

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,550
things but I don't need them so I skip

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,190
them but you get the general idea right

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,660
so it can extract text from devices it

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,760
has both cloud and on device ApS

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,370
available right so the benefit with

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,960
cloud EAP Isis so so the drawback or

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,950
limitation of on device API is it can

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,350
only detect lacked latin characters

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,870
let's say for support Hindi Gujarati and

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,050
other non Latin languages you have to

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,280
use the cloud API right so you can do

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,080
that you can definitely do that like if

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,020
you want to use if your you support non

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,150
Latin languages but yeah cards normally

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,180
have Latin characters so on device API

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,800
work for me yeah and so the

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,480
implementation or the steps involved

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,790
right even if you don't know how mobile

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,400
development works the steps involved are

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,990
very simple if you look closely so first

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,760
of all you have to create a firebase

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,620
which an image from the bitmap that you

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,320
receive so firebase vision image is a

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,910
class within 5 a sam'l kit right so that

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,650
this you create an object of the

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,970
firebase vision image class right on

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,070
this object

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,160
firebase performs all the inferencing

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,290
all the ML inferencing right so it's a

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,130
single encode you just write is the code

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,010
visible to everyone so the important

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,780
code is highlighted it's like in red so

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,460
you first create an image like this

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,080
language is caught in by the way jeaious

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,850
developers might find it somewhat

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
similar if you're a Java developer it's

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,260
again very similar it's not at all

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,420
strange from Java it's quite similar so

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,760
first of all you create a firebase

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,170
vision image right it's a single encode

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,460
just pass in the bitmap and it

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,840
automatically takes care of converting

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,840
that bitmap into a firebase vision image

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,910
right then next you get access to the

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,380
cloud or on device ex-detective

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,090
right so you get access to the

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,010
detector that actually going to detect

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,290
something on this image I mean that's a

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,210
single line code as well so so this is

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,890
the firebase vision class you get an

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,810
instance of that class and you get the

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,100
firebase which in cloud Tech's detective

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,080
writes for example I use the cloud

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,760
variant of the text detector you know

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,710
use the on device API you can simply

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,960
call vision text detector right that's

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,210
that EPA is documented very well so in

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,230
case you wanna like learn how the EPA is

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,030
working also take a look at the

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,000
documentation that something that you

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,610
can do so once this is done the next

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,830
step is run the detector on the image so

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,930
again so firebase vision text detector

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,030
dot detected image pass in the image and

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,200
attach some listeners so I have a

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,490
success listener I have a failure

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
listener there are more listeners there

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,690
is a completed listener right so all

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,380
these are lambdas so for example in the

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,820
successes now I get a single string so

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,760
that string contains all the words

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,320
inside this text document right and all

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,020
the new lines are separated by a newline

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,100
character right that's backslash n right

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:11,230
so simply like go ahead split the single

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,000
string at backslash N and perform some

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,790
register operations on the word that you

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,590
get to detect if that's card number or

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,440
is that an expiry date or is that the

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,900
username what's that like it's okay I

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,980
mean that's it again doing this won't

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,260
make you machine learning engineer

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,590
obviously that's something that this API

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:32,470
won't be able to do right but what it'll

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,430
do is it will arise your curiosity on

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,650
what all things are possible using

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,970
machine learning right so again there's

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,730
a custom model part that I'll be

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,620
outlining briefly right so in that you

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,300
can train a custom model of your own so

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,250
once you train your first custom model

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,140
you sort of know okay ok so this thing

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,720
is possibly using machine learning what

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,250
else is possible right but because if

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,230
you don't do this thing you probably

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,970
won't know the all the applications that

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,500
are possible using machine learning or

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,270
using pencil you are using by training

00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,950
your custom models but once you get into

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,960
the process but once you get your hands

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,430
dirty in the process then you know ok ok

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,930
so I did this now this is possible now

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,130
this is possible it's very similar to

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,780
other programming languages right if you

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,860
don't know app development you don't

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,720
know what sort of apps you will be able

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,250
to make but once you make your first

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,600
step once you know the basics okay okay

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,430
this is how app development works these

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,560
things are possible then ideas start

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,150
coming to an actually right so that's

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,000
something that I wanted to induce into

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,140
myself ok so just learn the basics like

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,780
learn how what all things are possible

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,160
right and once you know how the basics

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,710
of things work then you can probably

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,210
start brainstorming ideas you can search

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,890
online to see okay is this thing

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,990
possible or not but again that that

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,880
excitement that drive to know the basics

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,620
that was not available on online courses

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,270
right because they all start from the

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,440
very starts and maths and probability

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,710
part of things which I don't personally

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,330
like so yeah so this was the text

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,560
ejection API this was very simple three

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,240
lengths of code and the best part about

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,730
five aces all the APS are very similar

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,380
so if you know how one API works the

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,450
structure of all the other API is very

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,420
similar it's exactly the same right you

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,970
just have to change one or two things

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,770
okay so last is extract text from the

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,990
response that's done over here right so

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,330
I get the list of words I split them and

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,280
backslash N and I just print all the

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,360
words okay what all words did I get it

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,190
so that's that's almost it right so

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,080
inside one filler I like displayed a

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,100
message saying okay like something went

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:23,530
wrong please try again okay next up is

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,480
barcode scanning right so this allows

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,730
you to scan and process barcodes right

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,610
so this is part of Google's vision API

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,230
right so this has only one device API

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,760
available try it it runs barcode

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,410
processing on your device it doesn't

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,660
require internet connectivity to do that

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,460
right so again this is an example app on

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,900
the right side so I scan this QR code it

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,750
showed me okay the data of this QR code

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,089
is this is this only

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,890
so again steps involved exactly same so

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,839
create a firebase vision image single

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,720
line code so there's an optional

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,580
optional step as well that's not

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,290
available in all the api's right but it

00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,600
was available in the barcode scanner API

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,250
so you can determine okay but all type

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,480
of barcodes we want to scan so they are

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,730
more than twenty one type of barcodes

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,530
all right so I also learned this when I

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,690
was making this app that's something

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,880
else that I learned right so let's say I

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,589
want to scan only QR codes I do not scan

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,390
other kind of barcodes right so I can

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,400
specify that in this options object

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,680
right so I created this options object

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,800
object and I said the barcode formats

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,480
put all formats one of scan right and

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,980
inside this line of code I wrote okay I

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,360
want to scan all the format's so it's

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,250
essential it's very similar to not

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,600
passing this options object but I can

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,550
even specify okay but all barcodes you

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,350
want to scan when you want to scan the

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,360
QR codes right there a square in nature

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,670
you want to do you only want to scan the

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,529
barcodes that are like tank

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,899
or there are other kind of backwoods as

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,699
well right so this NV 21 type of barcode

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,959
right there's Aztec format they're more

00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:46,089
formats let's say you wanna only wanna

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,009
scan Aztec format barcodes then you can

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,839
specify that format inside this options

00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,899
object and your app will load and much

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,000
faster right okay so this is optional

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,190
this is not required if you don't pass

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,040
this option object inside this barcode

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:03,399
scanner it will detect all the barcodes

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,139
right that's what it does so next get

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,079
access to the on device barcode detector

00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,250
that was again single end code right

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,709
lastly I run the detector on the image

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,240
again so firebase detected dot detected

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,550
image pass in the firebase vision image

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,519
and attach some listeners so on success

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,769
or on failure listeners and extract data

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,540
from the response so this is how you

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,040
like extract the data so depending on

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,440
the type of barcode so I said okay if

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,089
the barcode contains a URL get the URL

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,380
from that bar code if the barcode

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,579
contains the contact and forget the

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,199
contact info from that bar code let's

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,790
say on a scale once I'm gonna store this

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,100
contact info if it's a URL I won't open

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,269
that URL if it's a driving license I

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,430
wanna see if that driver license I'm

00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,560
gonna validate that with an API right if

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,949
that's why if I I wanna connect to that

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,230
by five right so these things are

00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:49,839
available out of box i with firebase I

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,180
make it so that was the barcode scanner

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,910
API right next up you have the image

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,709
labeling API right so it works like

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,810
Google linz right so how Google dents

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,040
works not exactly like Google dance but

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,470
it's quite close to how Google dance

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,110
works so you take an image and this API

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,299
returns a list of objects or items or

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,799
emotions or colors or features that it

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,270
thinks are available in the image for

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,730
example I took an image of my headphones

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,140
right so it gave me a list of items it

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,880
said okay this image probably contains

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,500
headphones or it has it is related

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,010
technology or it has an electronic

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,900
device

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,730
or there's an audio equipment and all

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,520
these things right so again this has

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,079
both so it identifies objects location

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,030
activities animal species and all these

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,070
things so this has both cloud and on

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,960
device API available like it's so cloudy

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,419
API has more objects that it can

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,929
identify the on API has limited number

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:39,880
of objects that it can identify right so

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,679
yeah so steps involved are the same so

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,330
create a firebase vision image you can

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,500
optionally specify how many labels you

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,610
want to return how many items you want

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,380
to detect let's say I only want to

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,780
restrict this API to detect 20 items

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,270
right so do you give me 20 top items

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,710
then again get access to the own device

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,330
or cloud image detector

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,400
I run the detector on the image and

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,320
extract the results right it's again

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,570
it's it's exactly the same as other API

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,340
that we just saw so yeah this is the

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,549
crucial part of the CPI that I have just

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,020
outlined right so I got the name of the

00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:10,150
label and I got the accuracy or

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,010
confidence of that label so as you see

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,380
the confidence is listed as well right

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,390
so accuracy is probably 96% so it gives

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,900
you both accuracy and the name of that

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,210
label right so after this you have

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,980
landmark detection API right so that of

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,419
detects the landmark from an image so as

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,590
you can see so I took a picture and it

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:26,830
says okay this is crawley Golden Gate

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,990
Bridge

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,789
so latitude is something longitude is

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,580
something and the accuracy is something

00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:35,530
else right so this thing does not

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,539
extract the metadata from an image to

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,490
determine the location but it tries to

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:41,919
identify the popular landmarks in that

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,350
image right so this works with the Taj

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,909
Mahal or Colosseum or Marina Bay Sands

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,669
if you try it you'll probably get a

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,320
proper response from that image right so

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,090
this identifies a popular and much from

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,440
an image this probably won't work with

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,179
your backyard all right if you try it

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,789
with a picture of it back in probably

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,110
won't work right but yeah it works with

00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,600
all the famous landmarks I think it has

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,390
a it can detect more than 30,000 popular

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,950
landmarks right and this only has cloud

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,190
only API available so there's no on

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,190
device

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:48,200
well let's say you take everything let's

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,640
say you took a picture photo like six

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,610
months back at that time you didn't have

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,160
your location enabled so how it should

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,950
group those pictures so it doesn't rely

00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,290
on the metadata plate it detects the

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:14,030
image from the landmark it is a location

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:15,620
from the image available I mean there's

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:18,380
no way but if you're passing Latin long

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,690
you can use the reverse geocoding API so

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,580
you can extract the location from the

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,840
Latin long you can get the name that's

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,100
in the game too right so no need to

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,500
pause the image if you have the lat and

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,870
long simply go ahead and extract the

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,750
name from Latin long okay it's back

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:34,880
break all right so yeah so I think I was

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,840
at the Landmark addiction API right so

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:44,600
again steps are the same right you ten

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:46,010
minutes okay let's see so you get the

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,110
lat and long available with the response

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,610
right lastly you have the phase

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,170
detection API so that tells you okay

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,110
whether the object in the image is

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:56,690
smiling or is it angry is it what what's

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,510
the dimensions or what are the x and

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,230
y-coordinates of the face so that's lord

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,640
and savior

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,900
no mask so again step the same right

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,760
I'll just rip to the skip to the code

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,930
snippet directly so it's this right so

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,010
you get the right eye open probability

00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,150
you get the left eye open probability

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,400
you get the smiling probability with the

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,750
Aang angry probability the joy the

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,610
surprise probability all these things

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,730
right so you can sort of make an emotion

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,830
detection app using this API right so

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,050
lastly it's custom model study so I

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,360
won't be covering how I made this app

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,190
right because I mean first of all this

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,010
known not enough time I only have five

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:34,460
to six minutes thanks to the person over

00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:36,350
there right secondly it's it's not easy

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,730
to like somewhere a than a talk so I

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,990
have a written a blog post on this I'll

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,100
share the links with you you can go

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,810
through to go through the learning

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,120
process or the creation process of this

00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,740
app right so this custom model what

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,360
tensor flows or what the vibrational

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,980
gate allows you to do is you can sort of

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,100
create a tensor flow model or a tensor

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,200
flight model

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,910
hosted on firebase and five will

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,230
automatically serve that model to you

00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,850
right you don't need to include that

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,559
model in your app that will increase the

00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,850
size of your app just have the model on

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,110
five is five base will automatically

00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,260
download the model to run the model and

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,390
give you output from that model right so

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,070
so tips are for creating a good model

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,080
I'll give you some tips so have a lot of

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,750
image while training your model right

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,000
argument your data by modifying the

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,830
images that you already have right and

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,570
account for real-life use cases by

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,039
adding noise to a dataset so these

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,450
things might not make sense right now

00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,130
but once you go through the block posted

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:26,130
I'll be sharing that'll make more sense

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,780
right so sorry about that I could not

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,610
like expand on this because of the lack

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,770
of time but again so this is something

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,990
that I'll share resources with you right

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,970
you can go through those resources

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,830
okay so takeaways machine learning is

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,450
hard but it can be fun if done right so

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,070
it's hard definitely it's not easy so by

00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,419
doing this by using this API you will

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,870
not become a machine learning engineer

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:49,559
that's for sure right but it's fun right

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,179
and it's easy and it's fun if you you do

00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:53,520
it or you tackle it the right way right

00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,980
so it was fun for me it was relatively

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,080
easier for me because I like use the

00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,640
practical implementation sort of things

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,169
right with machine learning I didn't go

00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,260
through the go through the theoretical

00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:05,880
way so tools in ApS available make the

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,159
onboarding process super easy right so

00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,990
the lot of tools available so that makes

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,270
the process of onboarding our learning

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,740
machine learning very easy so for a

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,780
custom model having a good dataset but

00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,100
should be a primary focus so yeah if

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,080
you're using a custom model make sure

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,210
that your data set is properly right

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,820
it's properly you meant it has proper

00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,450
images and all these things right okay

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,880
so what's next

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:30,600
so after this talk what should you do

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,559
right so so ml kit the thing I just show

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,390
you where it showed you where you're

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,770
right it has all of code labs so have

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,409
you heard of Google code labs anyone

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:40,470
Google code labs so basically it's a

00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:43,080
step-by-step guide that Google has right

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,640
it has starter code it has what next

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,419
steps you should do and it has an end

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,789
code right so what you can do is you can

00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:52,020
try this code labs right so it will give

00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,820
you a starter code download that code

00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,010
then there's a step two I'll tell you

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,960
okay now add this code this code does

00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,669
this thing then add this code this code

00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,280
does this thing right so it's a

00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:03,460
step-by-step guide to making an app that

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,260
uses a milk it

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,000
so their various code labs available so

00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,800
first is there's a barcode scanner code

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,240
lab right you can take the links you can

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:15,250
lick snap some pictures we want right

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,230
that's fine so after that you have image

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,080
labeling API available so there's a code

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,350
lab for that you can like you can have a

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,330
Google in saloon this.x recognition code

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,830
lab available right that you can go

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,980
ahead and try it and play around with

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,000
right so there's a code lab for on your

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,410
custom model with tensorflow

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,030
right or a mill kit that's available

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,130
also the next steps would be so you

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,410
should try this code lab this like this

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,550
is a code lab that you must try after

00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,650
finishing with MLK

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,060
so that's tensorflow for poets so this

00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,160
takes you to the process of creating

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,020
your own custom model or your own

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,970
firebase API so the Pokemon app that I

00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,310
just told you about right so I had made

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,770
that a by following this code lab so it

00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,480
will it like both like walk you through

00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,250
the entire process of collecting the

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,200
data set right training your model on

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,240
the data set and using that model on to

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,190
firebase right so definitely do this

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,460
it's one of the best code labs that

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,450
Google has so far so something else that

00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,740
you can do is you can go through

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,870
Google's machine learning class go crash

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,240
course right so this is ml/cc this is

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,670
meant for developers right so this takes

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,840
you through the mathematical aspects for

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,880
machine learning tensorflow and all

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,710
these things it's again it's just four

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,710
weeks course it's relatively easy right

00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,300
it's practically then if you like what

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,650
you just saw so the apps that I just

00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,690
showed you right all the screenshots so

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,400
they are part of an app or some sample

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,650
app that I meet like that uses all these

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,580
api's it's on my github you can go

00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,290
through that app you can play around

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,540
with that app app is open sourced you

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,870
can go through the source code and see

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,100
okay how the app was implemented right

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,780
so there was a book this another app

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,860
that I just made using machine learning

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,080
five assembly that was talking about

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,670
right so it's pokedex by it so this is

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,740
again open sourced the data set is

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,170
available on kaggle right and it's live

00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,220
on Play Store as well so if you take a

00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,920
picture it'll tell you which Pokemon

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,140
that is right in the picture right so

00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,240
again so I mean there's some proof of

00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,950
the process that I've followed that it

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,660
works so by following the process I was

00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,100
able to make an app that uses machine

00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,870
learning that does not depend on the

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,310
pre-built API that uses a custom model

00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,020
and it's available on Play Store it's

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,700
live people are using it right so again

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,870
that's a validation so initially I had

00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,060
the ideation and this is the valley

00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,280
right so if you need to prove that okay

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,560
this thing what might not work so here's

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,500
the proof that it works try it yeah so I

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,840
think that's it from my side I have like

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,550
a blog post on all of these API is on

00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,110
all the things that I just like showed

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,640
you right there they are available on a

00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,160
medium account you can find me on

00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,380
Twitter and that's my github if if you

00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:44,670
have any questions right do we have time

00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:44,670
for questions okay yeah

00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,550
yeah

00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:57,010
so you can use image magic so image

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,680
magic so it's a it's a photo editing

00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,900
tool but they have a command line script

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,750
for it right so I used image magic to

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,220
sort of like scale and rotate my images

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,160
so initially I had only ten thousand

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,660
images right so I scaled and rotated and

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,360
cropped every image so for a single

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,310
image I had 21 more images so at the end

00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,110
or at the end of the day I had like 21 I

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,450
think twenty two hundred ten thousand

00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:35,500
images right so image magic you should

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:37,810
use them is magic yeah yeah over in API

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:43,870
so firebase has built an API stew call a

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:45,790
model that is one 5ds yeah it's possible

00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,320
so the only reason I used firebase for

00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,120
this verse because I don't have to bloat

00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:58,060
my app because the model is often 15m

00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:59,890
bees right so it won't affect I mean in

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,710
case in fact like deploying it on mobile

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,870
phone it's better because if you deploy

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,490
it on firebase right on firebase is

00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,050
console for the first time you launch

00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:11,440
your app the model is downloaded to your

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:13,060
phone right but and after that it'll be

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,770
used locally it will use from the local

00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,420
downloaded model but if you have the

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,920
model on your phone from the get-go

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,810
let's say you include that modern you're

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,670
in your apps source code from the get-go

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,560
it'll be much faster for you the first

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,990
launch will be much faster right it'll

00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:30,660
be like it will be hassle-free for the

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,660
user is that was attribution

00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,330
okay

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,720
the only battery life that you should be

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,110
concerned about is the camera that's

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,790
always running because I mean so a lot

00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,890
of new phones they have special

00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,720
dedicated CPUs for machine learning so

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,220
the noodle ntp is if your phone is

00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,020
running Android version marshmallow and

00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,250
above so they have a specific API for

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,890
machine learning so they are the neural

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,240
ray DPS so they reduce your battery life

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,130
sorry they reduce the battery

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,170
consumption significantly right before

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,700
marshmallow yeah it's it uses your CPU

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,710
that might affect the battery life but

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,690
after marshmallow that is Android 6.0

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,910
your battery life is like a much better

00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,440
buy when you are using these models but

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,940
again battery life is one of your least

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,440
concerns your main concern should be

00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,960
memory usage because the camera is

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,380
always running right and yeah that's

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,100
about it okay let's say Irish for a nice

00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,840
talk thank you

00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,840
