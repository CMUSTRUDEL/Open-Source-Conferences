Disruptive technologies are game changers especially in medical emergencies, where a few minutes can be the difference between life and death. With blockchain technology democratizing information distribution, Edge AI bringing intelligence to the end device, chatbots powered by enormous amounts of trained data mimicking human beings and machine learning and deep learning making accurate predictions, it has become possible to ensure the best medical care is provided to every individual irrespective of their place of residence. With all these technologies being open sourced, it is easy to focus on how to improve the efficiency, enhance the security and refine the accuracy while reducing the cost.

Automated Emergency Paramedical Response System leverages various open source technologies to provide medical supplies using aerial distribution by drones. It is a multi-functional end to end semi-autonomous system which operates differently in urban and rural areas based on their individual requirements. In semi-urban and rural areas, there is a need to provide access to specialised doctors and medical supplies as these are unavailable in their community hospitals. AERPS  leverages medical image processing and deep learning using OpenCV and TensorFlow to accurately predict the presence of disease like ischemic strokes and based on the diagnosis, allows the community hospital to order for medical supplies. The medical supplies are delivered using a drone enhanced with edge AI to run intelligent algorithms enabling it to ensure that the medicines are only delivered to authorised people and providing accurate obstacle avoidance thus making delivery in hard to reach places easier. In congested urban areas, an interactive chatbot with the ability to predict ailments based on patient symptoms informs the medical personnel who approves the delivery of medicines thus providing quick delivery of medical supplies where traffic is a major roadblock in providing medical assistance. Confidentiality of patient records has been achieved by using decentralised blockchain-based distributed computing to ensure security for the users without involving third-party institutions.

please welcome mushroom and samya that

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,300
will talk about automated emergency

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:11,670
paramedical response system and I guess

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,639
there will come some impact from a

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:19,770
artificial intelligence also here go

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,080
ahead thank you so much I know it's a

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,199
pretty late and I appreciate all of you

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,260
staying back and so this was a prototype

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,600
that we developed some time back for an

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,730
but the title is self-explanatory my

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,790
name is Sonya and this is my colleague

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:44,700
Martian and so one of our row main needs

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,590
is that we know that a lot there's been

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,070
a lot of advancement especially in the

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,100
medical sector in terms of tech but

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,809
there are some systems that are when we

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,510
look at it we feel like it's really

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,000
primitive like you we look at some

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,500
things and say oh this could be done so

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
much better this could be so much more

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,090
efficient if you know it had small

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,490
little tweaks in it and of course we

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,650
already know that a few minutes can make

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:17,040
a big difference between life and death

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:19,470
so that what we wanted to do with our

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,990
prototype of an automated emergency

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,640
power medical response system was to

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,189
fill in some of these gaps that we

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,579
thought was there in the current medical

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:32,640
system one of the driving motivations

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,189
that we had was to provide a feasible

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,540
solution that spans the entire

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,939
socio-economic strata as we know that

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,340
the problems that people in urban areas

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,189
have in terms of medical care is not the

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,409
same as people in rural areas the semi

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,520
rural areas would have in terms of

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:56,520
medical care in urban areas especially

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,369
in countries like India where I'm from

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,729
we do not have a dedicated lane for

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:07,009
ambulances so when we need emergency

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:10,319
medical response there's a lot of time

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,209
it's too late we it's just not fast

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,690
enough

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,910
whereas in semi urban and

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,880
areas reach ability is the problem for

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,120
medical care we need to travel

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,070
kilometers and kilometers there are no

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,450
specialized doctors that can be proud

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:31,930
that can be present in semi urban and

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,670
rural areas what we thought was the best

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,910
way to address these both of these

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:43,240
issues was a drone based para Medical

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:48,570
Response system so our prototype that we

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:51,670
develop has five different main modules

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,830
that will be touching upon in a little

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,060
bit and how they interact with each

00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:01,240
other and make the system whole one is

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,540
blockchain for medical records disease

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,660
detection chatbot a disease detection

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,030
model which is basically an umbrella of

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,850
specialized health care services that

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,540
you could provide to people in semi

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:18,720
urban and rural areas and drone for

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:25,300
medical delivery and facial recognition

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:29,260
during delivery blockchains for medical

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,480
record there are a lot of people who

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,320
have a divided opinions about what

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,800
blockchain means and why would you want

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,780
blockchain for medical record but what

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,500
we decided to do was implement a

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,650
blockchain for our automated let's just

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,350
call it a APRs the name is too long so

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:55,450
this isn't the interest of both patients

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,280
and doctors let me tell you why so there

00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,860
are a lot of times the doctors face

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,110
problems if patients do not declare the

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,540
Americal history in cases of

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,600
communicable diseases like tuberculosis

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,910
or diseases like AIDS we know that

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,640
doctors need to take extra precaution if

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,060
a patient has communicable diseases like

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,830
TB or diseases that can be transferred

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:23,740
through the blood like aids the the

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,810
there is the many patients do not want

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,980
to tell their doctors that oh I suffer

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,600
from TV or

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,360
aids or any of the other diseases

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,720
because they feel that you know they

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,120
would be discriminated again also

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,220
another thing that we found was that

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,770
availability of patients complete

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,420
medical history enables the doctor to

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,550
find out is something that you are

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,530
suffering today because of something

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,070
that already happened to you some time

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,290
ago

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,910
or is it unrelated at the same time

00:04:52,290 --> 00:05:00,190
patients need complete confidentiality

00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:04,810
about dr records and patients don't have

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,600
to carry one thousand x-rays and so many

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,530
forms of different hospitals different

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,230
consultation papers they want that only

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,700
my current doctor should be able to see

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:21,580
what medical data i have see the

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,070
benefits is that patients can choose who

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,100
can access the confidential confidential

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,920
information they are sure about their

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,550
privacy and doctors can take the right

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,550
decisions

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,610
Chad Bach is the detection chatbot so

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,470
what we found is on an individual level

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,760
even in urban areas you want immediate

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,830
you know chart body tech reduction based

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,850
on the chat board thing so for example

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,940
if you're suffering from something and

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,580
you want a committed consultation so

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,320
this not only in semi urban or rural

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,530
even in urban areas what you can do is

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,140
we have a chat board where so you first

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,270
fill in your details you name age and

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:15,400
whatever metadata is required then you

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:17,680
start you know you start interacting

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,870
with uh with the informatica API what

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,760
basically it does is based on your given

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,940
in form information it tries to detect

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,590
the symptoms and so basically what

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,510
happens is so fir first Wendell there is

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,610
no the detection has not been done for

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,560
if every API call there's a follow-up

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,200
question follow-up question so if

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,850
there's a pattern that you know this can

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,880
result to something else there will be a

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,240
follow-up question

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,150
you know given to you and once the

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,400
entire diagnostic diagnostics is done it

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,410
is sent to the admin who can then look

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,780
at your chart history see what your

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,340
symptoms are and and you know then look

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,720
at things like whether whether it is

00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,900
right - did you know deliver the

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,380
medicines to you or not so there are now

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,720
a lot of lot of companies which does

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,820
online delivery of medicines the

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,500
regulation says that there should be a

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,090
prescription prescription but in a lot

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,000
of cases you don't actually have a

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,640
consultation already done but people

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,860
still get it so what does does is act as

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,290
a layer in between that you interact

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,600
with the API have the Charter Street and

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,920
then that mean decides whether it's done

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,670
you know it's for the rightful reason or

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:33,950
not so the third module of this is the

00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,050
business Direction model based on deep

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,460
learning or computer vision this is

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,100
basically targeted for the community

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,770
hospitals so a lot of these hospitals

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,570
have these modalities the city scanner

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,170
and the MRI scanner all these things are

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,120
there but the you know the the

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,500
specialist has passed there's like one

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,660
dr. Lewton you know one billion in a lot

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,460
of cases there are cases like you know

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,440
urology where there's one doctor to ten

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,210
you know perhaps millions of patient in

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,950
countries like India so what does this

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,770
is so you already have the

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,170
infrastructure to take the scans with

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,610
different modalities so if you are a

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,160
community hospital what it does is

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,290
there's a new patient you decide which

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,680
model you want to test it you have your

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,740
DICOM you know taken from the the

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,780
modalities you send it you get uh you

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,400
know inference done and you have the

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,340
results so you have the you know initial

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,280
Diagnostics ready for you at least an

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,320
initial screening is done so for our

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,680
prototype we did it with the stroke

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,810
detection model where we you know did it

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,830
that's detected soaks based on deep

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,930
learning models another module is again

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,080
delivery by drone so once it is

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,580
protected so in case of individuals once

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,800
you interact with the chat BOTS you have

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,040
your like medicines approved or not in

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,009
case of community hospitals are

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,440
having a look at the you know inferred

00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,990
results from the model you can you know

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,519
you can request for some specific

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,709
medical aid to be delivered in both

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,690
these cases you can use the drones to

00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:10,269
use that geolocation and can get

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,000
delivered based on you know which from

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,920
your pharmacy partners or your blood or

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,540
blood or organ or whichever partner is

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:23,259
there based on everyone is having access

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:24,910
level and it can be delivered yes so one

00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:27,970
very important thing specially in case

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,649
of you know individual says you should

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,819
make you need to make sure that the

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,420
delivery is being done to the right

00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:34,120
person

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,949
so for that matter maybe I have an

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,170
account and you know I interacted with

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,850
my chart board but then I'll at the time

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,800
of delivery you don't know which person

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,630
is it at the same time you'll have to do

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,339
it on the fly and like literally on the

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,250
fly your drone should detect it on the

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,470
edge it's very difficult for it to for

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,540
you to you know keep it in continuous

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,910
interaction with the cloud to keep

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,009
sending that actually frames and then

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,779
getting the inference back so what we

00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:02,949
have done is we have used noodle compute

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,779
stick basically it's like fanless very

00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:07,029
tiny device perhaps I'll talk about it

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,130
in the lightning talk and 17th in much

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,920
more details basically what it does is

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,350
you can just you know offload your

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,959
models on that device and it will run

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,850
the model on you know on the edge in a

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,069
very low cost and it requires very less

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,709
power so even with something like as a

00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:26,110
spy it gives me the power to at least

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:29,500
infer or deploy my deep learning models

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,449
so that you know I can perform the

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,430
infant's on the edge another thing that

00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:35,620
is very important is when we are having

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,050
models like these it's not possible to

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,510
have all the faces in the world and then

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,670
train it for example if one of you is my

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,339
new customer I can't train my model

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,660
again to hide you as a class there so

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:50,100
for that what we have done is we have

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,750
used face net basically what it does is

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,939
only only the vector embeddings for your

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,680
face the new face is saved and we can

00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,329
save it as numpy array and while time at

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,250
the time of inferencing I'm just

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:02,589
comparing your vector and you know

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,750
embeddings with the live camera frames

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,850
and if it matches I know that person is

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,990
you and it this requires me you know not

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,089
to train my model for

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,310
every new class that is being added and

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,709
once I find that you know it's the right

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,160
person and it's the authorized person I

00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:20,970
can allow them all that don't do either

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,050
you know deliver you or give you door

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,180
medicines or in case of community

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,459
hospitals again the authorized persons

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:33,880
can only get the medical aids deliver to

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:36,100
them yeah so just these are some of the

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,959
technologies that we have used to what

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,490
we thought was the main areas that

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:46,180
require some little bit of technological

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,890
intervention so I just want to do you

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,560
know tie everything together

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,839
please forgive my bad use case diagram I

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,800
do not pay attention during my software

00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:00,850
engineering lecture so yeah there are

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,010
mainly three different people who can

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,339
communicate with the complete integrated

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,980
system one is an individual and when we

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:13,120
say individual we mean a person in an

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:17,350
urban area or rural area if there is

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,110
enough internet connectivity which when

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,029
you register for the service as an

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,000
individual what you can do is you can

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:27,760
access the dashboard you can register as

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,510
a new user and then as an individual

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,730
what you can do is you can access the

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,810
chat bot the disease detection chat bot

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:41,920
that you say okay today maybe I have a

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,600
little bit of fever or sorry or you know

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,380
I'm not feeling too good

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,589
whatever your symptoms are and your

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,810
symptom you know so if it says oh you

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:56,260
have a fever have you had a fever for

00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:00,910
the past five days or did you break a

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,430
bone recently so it gives that in sort

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,820
of follow-up questions that finally

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,690
gives it you know maybe this person has

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,270
ABC disease and when you get that maybe

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,730
you have ABC disease your admin gets a

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,680
notification that okay this person needs

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,500
medical attention they might have ABC

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,120
disease do you want to approve the

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,260
medicines for this but

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:30,460
kill a person and the admin can approve

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:33,910
or you know project your medicines then

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,040
we have a module for community hospital

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,690
and the community hospital can do a lot

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,970
of things the community hospital you can

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:47,529
say okay we are in a semi rural or rural

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:49,330
area and we have the need for maybe five

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,660
hundred tablets of paracetamol

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:55,300
and can you get this to us without us

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,800
having to travel some fifty hundred

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,140
kilometers and then the admin gets a

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,410
request with your particular geo

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:12,040
location and the admin can say ok yeah

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:16,690
we can give you that again yeah so the

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:22,270
community hospital also has under an

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:27,400
umbrella of the you know of the this I

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:31,600
mean specialization or disease detection

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:37,230
where can upload CT scans or DICOM

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,480
images and it can you can find out which

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,740
disease a person suffers from using the

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,680
CT scans so currently we have only one

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,420
module that we deployed which was for

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,089
stroke detection ischemic stroke

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,279
detection and a person can save the CT

00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,140
scan results what the community hospital

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:04,150
can also do is upload patient

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:08,730
information to the blockchain and as an

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:13,150
admin you can have a complete log

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:15,220
logging information about what

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,180
individuals have ordered which type of

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:24,300
medicines what community hospitals have

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:28,120
asked for and you know help in any case

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:32,010
this was our system architecture if

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,130
anybody is interested there are a lot of

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,860
specifications that are

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,430
that we use that is not necessarily

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,709
needed to be used we tried to keep this

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,389
presentation as impartial to the

00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,000
technologies that we have used as

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,759
possible because we just wanted to say

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,610
that okay this is what we can do this is

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,199
how we can look at Amazon as paramedical

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,389
responses what we thought were the gaps

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:06,050
that were there how we thought we could

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:09,250
fill it and gee I think we have some

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:13,639
time for questions and if you want more

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:17,959
information you can always refer to this

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:21,769
link it has the paper that was published

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,529
in Springer if you need any more

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,170
information that probably dwell delves a

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:32,300
little deeper we just wanted to touch

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:34,819
upon some things yeah thank you very

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:41,480
much first maybe an applause for this

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:45,100
nice presentation and indeed we have

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:50,810
time for questions somebody yeah we have

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:52,519
developed a prototype of this and we

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,680
actually hired a video but in the

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,600
interest of that it's a bit long so if

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,110
you would like to see it later probably

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,199
we can connect I'm just interested the

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,939
tail end the last month where for

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:09,650
pharmaceutical delivery the only really

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:12,140
tested drone delivery we have not

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,929
deployed the regulations again you know

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,839
won't let us you know test it that much

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:20,750
but per device in a restricted

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,559
environment definitely yes so yeah thank

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,480
you do you have any source code public

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,539
source credit available so we're

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,970
planning to so perhaps in a week's time

00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:34,010
the deployment models and all those

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,690
things are just cleaning it up it was

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,280
like it's quite messy we were just

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,530
trying out a lot of things but yeah

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,640
we'll publish a lot of these modules on

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,640
github so

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,179
like informatica is open-source the

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:51,970
models that we're using tensorflow

00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:54,370
that's open source so all of this is

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,960
open source we just wanted to give a

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,200
little bit of an overview how you can

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,120
tie all of these together but yeah well

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:09,700
probably in a week we'll have a little

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:10,960
bit more they can be yeah I have we have

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,020
the github account with that same name

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,850
so like for me the name unfortunately so

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,659
unique it will be very easy to find for

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:24,070
her it's a full name so yeah so it's

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,750
mushroom for me and so on massive enough

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,890
for her on github so we'll have our

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,150
perhaps poster on both maybe step two

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,010
step by step of you know which

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,440
open-source tools and libraries that we

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,020
used how we you know burrow together and

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,570
even whatever components we developed

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,760
most of it you know that will will be

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,950
you know pushing it you can find also

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,570
the contact information on the schedule

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,539
actually from full Asia there's the

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,880
github and everything available thank

00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,270
you thank you so much thanks for your

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,530
time

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,530
