TensorFlow is Google's popular deep learning library. The upcoming 2.0 version will bring many important improvements, with a strong focus on usability. It will be much easier to learn and use than before (in particular thanks to the Keras API), while preserving TensorFlow's key advantages over competing libraries such as Facebook's PyTorch or Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK): namely its amazing portability, its support for high-end hardware acceleration (including TPUs), its rich API and its huge ecosystem. In this talk, you will learn what's new in TensorFlow 2 and how to handle the migration from TF 1.x.
