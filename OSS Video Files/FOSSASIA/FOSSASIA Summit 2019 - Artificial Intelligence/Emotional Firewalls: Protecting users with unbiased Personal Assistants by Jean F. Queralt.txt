Presentation was not available during this talk due to a power trip. Thank you for your understanding.

The IO Foundation is working on a project intersecting a Digital Rights SDK (aimed at providing infrastructure for a Human Rights centered software design) and community-based, open source Personal Assistants, called Sidekick.

FOSSASIA’s Susi.ai has been identified as a potential element of Sidekick.


We wish to bring the attention to the audience upon:

- The importance of concentration of information;

- The importance of emotions and how user profiling is used to trigger reactions aligned with third-parties interests/agendas and not necessarily the user’s;

- How the right approach to Personal Assistants can help mitigating these issues;

- Launch the questions:

- Could this be the birth of a distributed knowledge paradigm?

- How could this approach shape stateless communities?


The session will follow a flow presenting a bit of history of information search interfaces, move into the relevance of emotions in our decisions, how information is used to profile users and how all those ingredients bring up a scenario where the line between an informed decision and an imposed decision is getting more blurry than ever.


Agenda:

- Searching for information

- Search engines

- Chatbots

- Personal Assistants

- Friends (that are not looking out for you)

- Data collection

- Linkability

- Profiling

- Choosing a Personal Assistant

- Enter Digital Rights

- Features

- DR SDK

- Case scenarios

- Access to information

- Refugees

- A peek on future systems of (e)Governance.


Expected outcomes:

- Raise awareness on the importance of Personal Assistants and their choice;

- Spark the conversation on this project;

- Identify stakeholders interested in implementing a PoC of Sidekick using Susi.ai.

- Create a PoC to be applied in the case scenarios described in the talk.
