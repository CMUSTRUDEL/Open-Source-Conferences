Title: Emotional Firewalls: Protecting users with unbiased Personal Assistants by Jean F. Queralt
Publication date: 2019-03-27
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Artificial Intelligence
Description: 
	15 March 2019 15:35, Event Hall 2-1

Presentation was not available during this talk due to a power trip. Thank you for your understanding.

The IO Foundation is working on a project intersecting a Digital Rights SDK (aimed at providing infrastructure for a Human Rights centered software design) and community-based, open source Personal Assistants, called Sidekick.

FOSSASIA’s Susi.ai has been identified as a potential element of Sidekick.


We wish to bring the attention to the audience upon:

- The importance of concentration of information;

- The importance of emotions and how user profiling is used to trigger reactions aligned with third-parties interests/agendas and not necessarily the user’s;

- How the right approach to Personal Assistants can help mitigating these issues;

- Launch the questions:

- Could this be the birth of a distributed knowledge paradigm?

- How could this approach shape stateless communities?


The session will follow a flow presenting a bit of history of information search interfaces, move into the relevance of emotions in our decisions, how information is used to profile users and how all those ingredients bring up a scenario where the line between an informed decision and an imposed decision is getting more blurry than ever.


Agenda:

- Searching for information

- Search engines

- Chatbots

- Personal Assistants

- Friends (that are not looking out for you)

- Data collection

- Linkability

- Profiling

- Choosing a Personal Assistant

- Enter Digital Rights

- Features

- DR SDK

- Case scenarios

- Access to information

- Refugees

- A peek on future systems of (e)Governance.


Expected outcomes:

- Raise awareness on the importance of Personal Assistants and their choice;

- Spark the conversation on this project;

- Identify stakeholders interested in implementing a PoC of Sidekick using Susi.ai.

- Create a PoC to be applied in the case scenarios described in the talk.

okay everybody we go on with the session

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,290
the next speaker is jean francois cara

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,170
and he will tell us more about emotional

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:18,630
firewalls protecting users with unbiased

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:21,000
personal assistance hi sounds good

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,699
no mixing with other sessions or

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,769
anything alright so my name is Jacques

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,849
wah most people call me junk it's kind

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,090
of difficult to pronounce my name

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,590
properly and that's fine by me I work

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,870
for an organization called the yo-yo

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,110
foundation we essentially work on

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,809
digital rights and that is roughly human

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,160
rights applied to new technologies we're

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,540
going to be discussing a couple of

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,480
things or mostly everything we'll be

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,969
discussing today in this session is not

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,039
that much technical okay and it might it

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,680
might not be the typical topics you guys

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,239
are confronted with on a daily basis

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,160
that's going to come with some

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,170
challenges and some friction let's see

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,300
if we can actually go past that because

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,260
it is the role that you play in how all

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,119
of this is going to be managed in the

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,330
future is way bigger than you normally

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,970
come to think of okay so first I would

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,030
like to do a small test on the on the

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,700
crowd can programmers stand up for a

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,770
second those who are active programmers

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,450
let's not be shy I work on the

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,920
development community so we actually do

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,869
this kind of icebreakers and whatnot

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,930
okay those who are not concerned with

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:37,860
how the data is used by other companies

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,420
sit down those who don't care they have

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,479
my data they can sell me any product I

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,810
don't care all right I'm going to assume

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,850
those could remain do care those who are

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,470
standing up who are familiar with the

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,630
concept of human rights just a concept

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:59,310
those who are not sit down okay you

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:03,030
heard about it right who of you have

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,369
ever heard about the UDHR the Universal

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,229
Declaration of Human Rights those who

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,530
haven't sit down okay

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:20,300
and which one of you has actually read

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:21,680
the UDHR those who haven't sit down okay

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,310
it's two more than what I expected

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,959
and actually three three all right and

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:33,500
that's kind of the elephant in the room

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,090
programmers are essential on the way you

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,200
can yeah I can see that yes yes sir

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,319
thank you thank you

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,840
round of applause for actually all right

00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:47,329
thanks programmers are essential in how

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,980
technology infrastructure is built all

00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,690
right a lot of people are complaining

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,549
about big companies using our data

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,560
collecting data linking profiling

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,030
whatnot and then in the same breath they

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,500
realize hey you know I just realized

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,440
with this new app that I can do I'm

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,200
going to monetize my customers data they

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,420
don't seem to be linking the two things

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,579
okay you have a lot of influence on that

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,739
you're going to have the decision to

00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:11,870
make on how do you architect your next

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:18,079
applications so this respect your data

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:21,530
and your customers data now I'm going to

00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,209
be trying to get some pieces of elements

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,069
all together and through the

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,139
conversation you will see that they're

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:30,680
actually start converging to the topic

00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,660
of of today right it may not sound very

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,489
very logic but just this there's a

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:40,910
method to Matt minus a few warnings

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,450
though I'm going to ask you to keep an

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,160
open mind

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,780
for the whole thing like I said this is

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,380
gonna be topics that are not usually on

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,609
the table for on your daily lives

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,109
English is not my mother language even

00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:54,889
though I'm kind of fluent but sometimes

00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:57,109
I get stuck so bear with me I'm

00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,180
suffering a bit of jet lag from from

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:05,780
coming up and trying to get with it so

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:08,359
again bit of patience all right what do

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,650
we essentially do when we are

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,669
interacting with devices most of the

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,810
time we are trying to obtain information

00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:16,390
right okay how do we start back in the

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,859
days before we had devices

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,109
obtaining information so we had two

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,660
systems we first started going

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,070
peer-to-peer we just went to the caveman

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,050
door and ask him you know we're gonna

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,490
find deer I'm I'm hungry I need to go

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,840
and hunt and they will tell you this is

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,780
the best present in the Prairie to go

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,340
and hunt then someone figure it out if

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,870
we put all the information together in

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,570
one place then people don't have to go

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,160
asking around and we can actually

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,750
centralize all the knowledge that we

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,300
have as a village as a community and

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,120
have it there as a reference so kami

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,330
libraries now the interesting part is

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,880
libraries were designed with one

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:57,830
specific objective impact they were

00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,330
designed in a way that you as a person

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,280
could go there obtain as much

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,080
information as possible as fast as

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,740
possible and the information that you

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,330
wanted okay now moving forward turns out

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,700
that there's this cool thing called

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,320
search engines we start getting into

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,210
digital area we have access to all of

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,330
that and we have essentially libraries

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,000
who are digitalized and search engine

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,100
school all around they start crawling

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,230
they start indexing information and they

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,660
have their own algorithms to index that

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:33,020
information now the big difference is

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,920
that those algorithms are not designed

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,290
for impact

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,470
they are designed to make money and

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,300
that's a big shift in so shift that most

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,880
of the term has been very transparent or

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,030
very Placid sorry the opposite very opac

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,220
for us it hasn't been communicated to to

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:54,160
users in a very upfront and honest

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:57,290
manner how did we start interacting with

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,540
with websites well we basically went to

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,860
our website so search engine we went to

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,680
a website and we started figuring out

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,230
keywords okay when we needed to find

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,890
ways to pinpoint exactly the information

00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:13,280
that we wanted and try to refine all of

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:17,720
that until we found the results that we

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,600
thought we were looking for has anyone

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,890
gone in the last year's ever beyond say

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,500
Google for instance I'm not gonna assume

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,530
most of you use Google has anyone gone

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:33,410
past page number five of any search

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:35,410
result okay at least someone tries all

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:39,170
right so imagine

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,240
how all of a sudden if you are not on

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:45,200
page number five essentially didn't

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,050
exist most people don't even go to page

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,700
number three and I would bet some money

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,760
here that most of us don't even go past

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,260
page number one how you're reducing the

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,050
view of the world and how you are

00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,800
skewing that it has a lot of dire

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,270
consequences and how the algorithm is

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,740
deciding what you want to see on what

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,130
they think they want to see on what they

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,270
want to present to you change it a lot

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,620
how is going to be your perception of

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:14,450
things all right now enter chat BOTS

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:20,000
has anyone been here developing chat

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:24,380
BOTS lately okay has anyone really

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,730
thought about what a chat bot is I mean

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,350
I I'm a person who doesn't really like

00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,140
hype words and I don't like you know

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,190
marketing and whatnot the way I see it a

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,780
chat board is a guided search engine

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,300
okay the same way as you were before

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,680
looking for keywords all of a sudden you

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,380
get a software that is providing you

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,210
those keywords to search you are tapping

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,640
a certain term and then the chat about

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,260
ask you where you refer into this or

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,900
were you referring to that it is

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:56,720
essentially guiding you towards a much

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:59,990
more targeted result which is cool I was

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,020
last year in this low tech hackathon in

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,550
in KL I live in here and it was

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,890
interesting because they were trying to

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,560
bring technology into law and they were

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,419
providing a number of tracks and people

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,610
were basically developing an omental

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,020
solutions and in around 80% of the

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,090
solutions that were presented by all the

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:23,960
teams were chat BOTS and of course the

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:26,240
question came like why well because when

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,030
we interact with the chat BOTS we feel

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,730
as if we interacted with someone else it

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,860
feels much more natural it's engaging a

00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,960
number of emotions that makes us feel

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,080
much more relatable to the product has

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:43,099
anyone here try the this uncle buzz chat

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,740
bot it's funny as hell don't you heaven

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,960
just look for it and have a have a talk

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,649
with him it really interact with you in

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,660
a way that

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:54,319
is very natural using natural language

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,720
expressions and it's engaging okay so

00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:58,490
it's way less cold and I'm using my

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,769
turns very very on purpose than a

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:13,339
typical website now yeah telephone is

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:16,939
not I'm looking for a few years now we

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:21,439
have all of these companies especially

00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:23,119
Amazon Google Samsung lately who have

00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:25,850
been trying to push these personal

00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:30,139
assistants Apple with Siri into our

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:36,019
lives okay we kind of got a costume to

00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:39,829
it it's interesting because the way we

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:42,740
are interacting with those personal

00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:46,670
assistants it's even more potentially

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:50,149
engaging because well done it feels like

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,439
we're talking with the body now the only

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:59,149
difference that that body is not really

00:09:51,439 --> 00:10:01,519
a friend okay so when I was mentioning

00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,249
before about the amount of pages that

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:08,689
you have when you go for a query and you

00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:10,309
don't go beyond five pages if you say

00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:13,309
for instance Siri where can i buy

00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:15,679
potatoes for my stew tonight do we

00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:17,720
really expect Siri to say I'm in a draw

00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,610
I got five pages of results for you 50

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,939
hits each or one of them let me read one

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,529
by one you don't want that you're

00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:27,980
expecting a much more fluid conversation

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,420
telling you this tops two options one of

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,459
the grocery downstairs in other words

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,769
somewhere else okay that would be an

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,100
optimal result for you something that

00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,899
really is what you're looking for and

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,220
affordable and you know available for

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,959
you to resolve in five 10 minutes

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,009
because you know nobody has free time

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:49,420
apparently but when we are talking about

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:53,899
these companies who are putting this

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,939
personal assistance which is the model

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,189
that they are following are they're

00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,319
following the old-time library system of

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:02,180
impact why are they following a business

00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:06,950
model trying to sell you

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:10,670
part of my French the second one and

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:14,839
here comes the question can I be sure

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,120
that the information that they're

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,160
providing me is the one that I really

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,220
want and I really need or just the one

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,649
that they want to push into me it's a

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,830
very simple question it's just not the

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:33,279
one that they want us to to talk about

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:33,279
so again please don't do this to me

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,540
let's go back a little bit on how this

00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:43,490
is played out by the looks of what I'm

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,100
mentioning it would sound like I don't

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,950
like data I actually like data okay

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,020
data's good we need data to be able to

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,300
make informed decisions in order to do

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,310
plants even if sometimes that data can

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,310
be very sensitive the problem is never

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,160
to have a data set is to make it so that

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,050
we cannot attach the name in a face that

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,510
dataset so that information cannot be

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,350
used against someone that's a basic

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:11,330
principle of data protection the typical

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,000
example would be that say if I'm a

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,779
government I would like to know how many

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,459
people have HIV in my region okay

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,430
because I need to know where they're

00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,420
going to be my contingency plan how many

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,870
antivirals I'm gonna have to buy for the

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,350
next season and and whatnot now what I

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,279
don't need to know exactly who has it

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,529
because otherwise I can actually use

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,970
that information against that people in

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,830
the case for instance Malaysia if you're

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:43,900
a civil servant and you are known to

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:43,900
have a HIV you can be kicked out now I

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,829
don't think this comes to really

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,160
surprise to anybody of you any

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,420
interaction that we do online is

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,600
essentially creating digital breadcrumbs

00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:03,020
about who we are okay you bros you by

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:07,100
your date you go watching the biggest

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,240
repository of nothing and essentially

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,670
all of that is collecting a lot of

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,370
information of yours now company loves

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,260
to do what's called link ability which

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,889
is trying to figure out ways smart ways

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,239
as possible

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:19,309
to connect all of those different

00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:23,119
separate databases and start creating

00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:26,389
profiles profiles that says a lot of you

00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:28,819
not only your personal features but most

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:33,919
importantly how you think how you feel

00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:36,799
and what are your preferences okay we

00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,540
tend to disregard all of that but

00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,169
essentially what they want to know is

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,790
what are your potential emotions what

00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:46,369
are the buttons that activate those

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,279
emotions and how to play those buttons

00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:51,889
and if you think that emotions are not

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,179
so important think about right now about

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,189
how you're feeling about this talk

00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:56,989
whether is engaging you or whether is

00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:00,439
boring you but that's one emotional

00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:02,299
plate and if I knew exactly how to talk

00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:06,859
to each of one of you in the right way

00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:09,980
to engage you bingo I'm selling myself

00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:12,549
here all right

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,720
at any given interaction that we have

00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:16,160
emotions are always going to be at play

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,669
that's exactly how we are defined as

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,379
people there's no escaping that and we

00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,939
have to be very aware on how is that

00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,679
playing out with the technology that we

00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:26,540
are using and how is that being used

00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,119
against us to follow a certain agenda

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,949
whether it is commercial whether its

00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:34,100
political can be generally teeka anybody

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:36,350
okay

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,419
and that's just the beginning I mean III

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,499
I want to guess as most of you knew that

00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,269
camis analytical

00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:44,809
even though we didn't know the name did

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:46,339
exist already I don't think anybody who

00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:48,439
was more or less following the trends of

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,199
things god oh my god there are some

00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:54,369
people trying to use data against us in

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,369
terms of changing our political views

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:59,839
the problem is coming idea is not even

00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:02,269
the problem they were in the spotlight

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,339
because it was very mediatic and and

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,649
whatnot but there are bigger companies

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:08,269
who have much more information not even

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,119
only public information as these guys

00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:15,109
did and we all know the names of these

00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:20,269
companies they know exactly what we

00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:22,660
don't want them to know and and here's

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,660
the funny part

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,010
so let's say for instance what happened

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,899
with a a a bit back in the in the days

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,990
in into into marketing which I tend to

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:35,870
demo nice but if I was a guy who wanted

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:39,440
to sell vacuum cleaners okay I needed to

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,690
first marketing pool and have a look at

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,190
my current research and try to figure

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,839
out the demographic where I can sell

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,019
this particular vacuum cleaners in the

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,850
world and try to manufacture the right

00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:53,380
amount to make a profit and not to you

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,380
know lose money with the manufacturing

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:59,899
that was a lot of money and as I work

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:03,320
now we are providing them the only with

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:06,110
the information but actually also with

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,890
the channel to reach out to us and we

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:16,790
were just buying them there was this guy

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:18,890
who he made a talk on on TED talk kind

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,029
of a funny talk about him pretending to

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:25,339
follow one of those email scams the

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,019
Algerian prints and whatnot he was just

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,370
pretending and you know replying and

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,899
it's really really funny I recommend you

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,870
to have a look at it he said something

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:34,430
very very interesting we got into the

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,760
internet and we thought oh we have

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,410
access to all of this fantastic what we

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,100
didn't realize is that now all of that

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:48,680
has access to us and we were not

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:51,230
quantifying that before so here we are

00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,500
now with personal assistants I pushed

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,160
into us that talk to us directly that we

00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,990
think our bodies and that when they

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,850
provide us with solutions and with

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,470
answers are we expecting that they are

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,799
providing the ones that we want or the

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,319
ones that they want and so who is going

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,459
to be actually being the result

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,740
essentially two types of of answers one

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,390
those who have a specific agenda to be

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,169
there and to those who can pay to be

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,150
there because when your world is reduced

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,829
this very small amount of options and

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,260
because it's convenient we actually just

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,530
stay there who is going to go and double

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,150
check unfortunately every since we're

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,990
kids no one at school was telling us you

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,150
know you should double-check your

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,690
sources most of us don't go through

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,730
general is

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,860
training for instance and try to be very

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,740
accurate and double-check things that's

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,350
not really what happens and think about

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:51,700
how that effects the freedoms that I was

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:55,970
mentioning before in UDHR Human Rights

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,440
all of a sudden data is you know I'm

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,870
giving away my data

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,330
well data belongs to you and one of the

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,190
principles in a in Human Rights is that

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,800
you have the right foot possession and

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,720
to retain possession technology is not

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,850
really providing us right now with a way

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,740
to make sure that if I request for a

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,320
company to delete my data the data is

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,780
actually deleted what we have is

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,260
something much more akin to if you ever

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,320
heard about gdpr for instance

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:33,350
yes okay what we have is much more keen

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:36,680
as to so here's a brick please make sure

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:40,090
that the brick follows the

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,770
specifications build your building and

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:46,010
if it collapses here are the laws that

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,300
I'm gonna use to sue you but they're

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,510
always going to go and check that the

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,040
building on itself okay gdpr is

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,780
essentially a law that allows you to sue

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,630
a company if after you requesting the

00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,140
data later on you discover that they did

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,460
not delete the data but the the request

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,720
doesn't come attached with the team of

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,970
specialists flying all the way from

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,330
Brussels to whichever server anywhere in

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,010
the world

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,350
and make sure the data is actually

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,790
deleted nevermind how many times have

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,290
been copied that never might have been

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,650
that times has been sold to other

00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,910
companies there's no such thing and here

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,360
comes the paradox when it comes to

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,090
technology

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,670
you guys know very well you get to

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,140
decide how the software works so if you

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,360
wanted to provide a technical

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,670
reassurance to that you could just the

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,870
industry it's not really supporting that

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm not getting as I see your face off

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,970
of that I'm not saying this is easy or

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,940
hard that's another story okay

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,560
but it's a matter of will and the moment

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,410
that you proceed there's a game and not

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,640
necessarily economical there's always a

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,260
way to do it and if the transition

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,190
requires five years then you go for five

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,890
years GDP

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,390
in fact was was approved in 2016 and

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:59,500
they gave two years well for

00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:04,580
implementation until 2018 so well again

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:07,580
now how does that come together to what

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,920
I was mentioning before out of this

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,320
concern what we identified in our

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,290
organization was that the big thing that

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,760
we need to protect people in terms of

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,800
personal assistance which is a good idea

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,200
I mean it's very nice if you think about

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,300
it a personal assistant is sort of the

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,890
pokémon evolution of what we wanted ten

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,170
years ago when we started with devices

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,330
we had we bought this very cool computer

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,030
put it at home and thought I want this

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,670
computer to help me I wanted to do

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,400
things for me and to assist me and to

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,650
make me gain time and to provide me with

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,060
very cool services and whatnot and I'm

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,470
going to install this web server and I'm

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,830
going to be providing you know I'm gonna

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,540
install mastodons and whatever cool all

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,120
right and it will be even easier if you

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,430
can actually read remove this very

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,810
clunky interface which is a screen in

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:58,160
the keyboard itself is a pretty slow

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,050
interface you don't really communicate

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,450
with your video devices at the speed

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,790
that you would like I mean here comes

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:09,950
with a mask wanting to connect our heads

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:13,700
with with neuro-link now we see as

00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,870
personal assistants as potential device

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,480
that's going to do this these kind of

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,360
things but do you really want to

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,150
surrender all of your capacity of

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,510
rational rationality into those devices

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:28,190
so we believe that the only solution for

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,920
that and actually the the big companies

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:34,730
are pretty known as recorded yzma

00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,400
they're scared shitless about this kind

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:41,590
of models that could that could appear

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:44,720
where by supporting open-source unbiased

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:48,530
non-business biased personal assistance

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,080
such as SUSE delay I would probably be a

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:55,550
solution for this and how you could

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:59,990
apply to that is you would have a base

00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:01,880
of of people using this kind of personal

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,210
assistance open-source peer reviewed you

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,789
name

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,249
you know all the advantages already and

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:09,320
start using gossip protocols by the way

00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:12,889
by which you would be obtaining

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,659
information a distributed manner and you

00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:19,700
will be the judge of how the information

00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:21,259
is actually reaching to you you can

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,299
imagine that's not a business model that

00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:24,710
really interests big companies and so

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,590
they are doing all they can to actually

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,070
push their alternatives into into our

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,029
houses and honestly who wants to have

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,220
Alexa listening 24/7 at home I

00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:39,200
personally don't feel like it if you

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,149
guys want to think about the kind of

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,960
unintended consequences that that can

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:47,350
have I guess some of you are familiar

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:53,389
with football and the Spanish La Liga

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:56,659
okay I'm from Spain about two three

00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:59,240
months ago turns out that the official

00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:00,470
application from from Malaga that people

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,610
were installing in their phones and I'm

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,259
not even talking about all the way to

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,240
personal assistance just an ad that you

00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:06,710
were installing the what they would do

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,539
that well they didn't know was that the

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,330
app was activating the microphone of

00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:15,289
their phones during times of the matches

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:18,559
to try to figure out which bars which

00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:22,159
venues were not paying taxes for

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,909
broadcasting the matches and of course

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,529
no one knew about that it came as a big

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,860
scandal and of course you know people

00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:36,379
started uninstalling and and whatnot but

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:38,269
that is without you even knowing on top

00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:40,580
of that you gotta buy a product and have

00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,139
it 24 hours knowingly in your in the

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,820
living room recording almost everything

00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:46,850
you do it with no control whatsoever

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,499
with those recordings yeah you can

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,779
subpoena them and you can send a request

00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:52,610
for it yeah yeah yeah whatever let's see

00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,559
how long it takes and let's see how much

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,299
information to actually give you because

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,059
the mind will be providing you all the

00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,470
metadata for instance they can provide

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,820
you with the raw data but very likely

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,529
not with a meter and specifically know

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,629
what they have learned from you when

00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:10,730
they when when Facebook came with this

00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:12,529
can I say I said already sorry

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,019
when when Facebook came with this

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:16,010
 tool about you can download all

00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,040
the information that you

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:22,790
that we have about you well you can

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:26,390
download is the raw data yeah sure but

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:29,630
not everything they know about you dad

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,919
they don't share the type of preferences

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,799
that they think that you have the type

00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,980
of salaries that you may have the people

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,900
you might be related to none of that

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,540
what really matters that they are not

00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:51,710
telling you

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:55,220
so resuming and almost almost under yeah

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,580
almost with the dot when it comes to

00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,900
personal assistance we don't think

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,970
organization don't think that commercial

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,309
ones are going to be any good I'm not

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,660
saying that they are totally evil most

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,309
of the time even the programmers who are

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,270
involved they're just not aware about

00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,530
the things that they're doing they are

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,630
not thinking long-term they're nothing

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,280
at about counted consequences part of

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,929
the of the work that we do in in the IO

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,549
foundation is specifically try to train

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:18,440
programmers into human rights and

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,970
digital rights so they get to have a say

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,280
in a voice in the project that they

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,850
develop but it's very very important

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,340
that we support open source movements by

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,470
which we know exactly what's the code or

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,960
at least we expose the codes peer-review

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:36,169
can be done we can try to avoid as many

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,230
biases as possible it always comes down

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:41,900
to this question where is the line

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:45,169
between an informed decision and an

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,900
impose decision it's a very difficult

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:50,210
answer to be to be had I personally

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,470
don't have you know I have an opinion

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,780
but I don't have an actual answer to

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,520
that it's up to you to guys to think

00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,140
about what part of responsibility you

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,730
have and try to collaborate in these

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,900
kind of projects and maybe try to do

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,900
some good thank you

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:14,019
Oh Flo so we have time for a question

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,090
probably the discussion will be a

00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:25,659
continued tonight at the pop troll I

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:26,710
assume can questions so one of the

00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:28,960
things I was thinking about as you're

00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:33,240
talking is I think one of the core ideas

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,340
you're expressing is is that being

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,779
cognizant of that we should be cognizant

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,639
of the potential for these apps and

00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,999
applications to manipulate us in ways we

00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:45,369
wouldn't be comfortable with and I was

00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:47,019
thinking that I mean all interaction

00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:50,340
with the external world could be

00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:53,080
construed as manipulation to some extent

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,539
insofar as when I buy into an ecosystem

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,019
I agreed to be pushed and prodded in

00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,700
certain ways why should I care about the

00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,799
way Google does it or the way that

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,019
Facebook does it I still have free

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,669
agency and I have the responsibility to

00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:09,700
be aware of the way that they're doing

00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:11,710
these things so you know why remove

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,990
myself from that service so there's two

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:18,159
elements on that on that I would give

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:19,869
him my answer one not everyone has

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,299
access to the same education that you do

00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:25,480
or to the same opportunities to actually

00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:27,789
grow into their education and if you

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,470
think about it let's call it away from

00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:31,779
from coding and from from tech all

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,350
education is basically a sort of

00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:37,059
interpreting doctrine ation okay so if

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,749
you don't provide the right tools for

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:42,700
people to be able to think and to exert

00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:44,769
logic and to double-check facts

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,789
whichever information you have give them

00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:50,710
at birth that's the vision of reality

00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:52,090
they don't go beyond that if you haven't

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,480
been sparking questions you have a mean

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:59,799
sparking interest curiosity okay and oh

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:05,009
yeah thanks and the second part of what

00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:10,419
you tell you I just forgot oh yeah

00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:14,230
relation of of cost I was mentioning

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:16,920
before it took me so if I want to be

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:19,720
pushing a certain idea into you okay

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,370
how effective I'm going to be is very

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,080
much related to how much money I have in

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,240
my bank to actually push for the idea

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,530
and how much it costs me to actually

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,390
implement those things think about the

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,510
example that I gave before about selling

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:36,670
the vacuum cleaners okay I don't have

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,160
enough of a picture and specifically I

00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,860
don't have a direct channel to you so I

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,900
need to maximize my impact trying to

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:47,770
talk to a variety of people with a much

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,210
more broader language okay but all of a

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,390
sudden now I have technology that allows

00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,750
me to talk to you to the very much you

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,430
too

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,470
because identify that you have enough

00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:59,500
things in common and I can create those

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,490
ads on the fly with software I don't

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,680
even need to need a graphic designer

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,140
anymore and I don't even need to produce

00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,560
the product beforehand I can print it

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,490
out in 3d for you directly so the cost

00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:17,080
for me to put push anything that I want

00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:19,420
it's ridiculous the dangers on how much

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,590
more attempts to try to manipulate and

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,740
to push things that you may not really

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,750
need without looking into the final

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,760
consequences of it I just way bigger

00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,760
nowadays because of the cost

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,760
and of course you need to ask yourself

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:47,770
what kind of planet you what do you want

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:49,710
to leave that that's okay so real good

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:53,470
talk

00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,900
personal assistant is interesting but if

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,210
you look a few years later when we move

00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,820
to augmented reality we go from

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,040
searching that asking a question to

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,230
actually entire reality being pushed at

00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,840
us and there is device to do a good job

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,700
we'd have to know who you are and and

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,100
push

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,080
entire layers of realities this issue is

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,220
not going away it's going to get much

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,280
more important where you actually

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,890
control what people see now on the

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,510
slightly more positive notes there's

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,030
another way there is open source as you

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,240
mentioned but if you think of a product

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:31,540
like tinder all right tinder you pay for

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,370
it and they make money if they are

00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,230
successful in matching you if somebody

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,790
you like because then you're going to

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,970
tell all your friends and they get more

00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,920
customer so the quality of their product

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,570
need to increase for them to be

00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,590
successful if tinder was a completely

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,390
free product yes I agree with you but

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,370
something with personal assistance if

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,830
you pay for it then you're going to try

00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,660
to find the best possible one and this

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,400
one will be motivated to find what's

00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,410
best for you not what's best for you

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,230
with an agenda of course what they do

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,840
with the data is a different discussion

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,460
first is who is the owner of the data

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:11,530
companies believe they are the owners we

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:13,950
don't believe that's that's the case one

00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,950
two yeah

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:25,670
we don't believe that's always the case

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:27,280
actually never and second yes the

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,840
conversation was for the talk was about

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,350
personal assistance no it's not the

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,630
endgame

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,120
okay the endgame is actually to Train

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:38,030
programmers I was trying to not really

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,980
you know be heavy on that but the fact

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,870
that all of these services that you are

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,050
mentioning including augmented reality

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:47,060
are going to be coded by programmers we

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,470
identify them as the the next generation

00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,610
of human right defenders because they're

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,140
going to be just the forefront of

00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,460
developing the apps that we are so much

00:31:51,140 --> 00:32:04,150
concerned about there's no escaping that

00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:06,830
any more questions I think we are

00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:10,190
probably know okay it's working yeah so

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,770
uh my question is basically about what

00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,650
is this called regulatory regulation and

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,030
regulatory arbitrage because basically

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,430
most of what you're proposing in order

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,830
to make any record regulatory headway

00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,120
you need kind of a global approach

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:27,260
because all of these companies are

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,480
basically global companies amassing data

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,550
from all over the world so there's

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,890
there's two things to to be considered

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,790
one software industry is one of the less

00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,580
regulated ever

00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,770
and when I say less regulated is I am

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,550
not aware if anyone can correct me of

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:45,140
any technical regulation as in software

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,280
should be behaving respecting this

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,320
particular rise of this particular

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,540
services under this particular code and

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,010
we as bodies of governance were

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,140
endorsing this particular thing so if

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,490
you want to release software in our

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,190
jurisdictions you're gonna have to be

00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,650
able to make sure that these things are

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,710
done in this way using these api's or

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,700
whatever this might sound very crazy but

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,130
imagine what's happening in this

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,510
building for this building to be

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,820
accepted it goes to a number of

00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,650
regulations and we all assume that they

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,420
are done there to be to provide us the

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,770
safety of being able to walk into the

00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,750
building and it's not gonna crumble onto

00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,220
us

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,650
for some reason software hasn't still

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,210
fall into that logic and I can just

00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,160
craft a new software that I want put it

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,540
out there collect all the other I want

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,540
and come and find me

00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:37,330
yeah I don't believe so if if you

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,710
restrict yourself into the specifics of

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,780
protecting the rights of users I'm not

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,670
talking about you know curtailing

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,400
businesses but the thing is if you have

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,710
businesses whose business model is based

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,210
on breaking human rights where is

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,590
actually the problem that I'm not giving

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,960
them business or the other breaking

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,640
human rights I mean let's have the

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,650
conversation there and when it comes to

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,720
business itself just so you know this

00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,040
initiative from the UN called guiding

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,660
principles on business and human rights

00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,880
which has been pushed in the past year

00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,820
specifically to try to provide this kind

00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,300
of approach for organizations thank you

00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,300
thank you very much

00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,389
