Technological advances in the last decade have led to a resurgence of interest in AI for solving critical business problems and enabling new & transformative business models. Along have come common fallacies in the implementations of AI systems leading to mounting technical debt and infrequent, unsustainable deployments. IBM has brought together a set of industrial AI capabilities and tools that provide a robust open AI platform for the enterprise, built to consistently leverage a wide choice of open source libraries and data science runtime environments. Do not miss this session on the latest IBM announcements bringing AI capabilities to the data -- wherever it may exist in hybrid and multi-cloud data estates -- and infusing the trust and transparency needed from industrial AI into any business processes with confidence.
