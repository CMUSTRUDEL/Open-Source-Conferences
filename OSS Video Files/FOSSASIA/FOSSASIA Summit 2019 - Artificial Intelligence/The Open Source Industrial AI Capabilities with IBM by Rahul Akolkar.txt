Description: 
	15 March 2019 11:00, Lecture Theatre

Technological advances in the last decade have led to a resurgence of interest in AI for solving critical business problems and enabling new & transformative business models. Along have come common fallacies in the implementations of AI systems leading to mounting technical debt and infrequent, unsustainable deployments. IBM has brought together a set of industrial AI capabilities and tools that provide a robust open AI platform for the enterprise, built to consistently leverage a wide choice of open source libraries and data science runtime environments. Do not miss this session on the latest IBM announcements bringing AI capabilities to the data -- wherever it may exist in hybrid and multi-cloud data estates -- and infusing the trust and transparency needed from industrial AI into any business processes with confidence.

important to open this session with one

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,309
of our key sponsors IBM and so I'm gonna

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,320
introduce Raoul from IBM who leads the

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,580
world wide data Sciences and AI

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,529
technical sales at IBM so roll first got

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,600
involved in open source communities more

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,640
than 15 years ago and contributed to

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,180
numerous open source projects and

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,340
industry standards he's an elected

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,699
member of the Apache Software Foundation

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,710
so that's itself is very impressive and

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,270
in the related space role is done work

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,520
on standards with the World Wide Web

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,469
Consortium he represented IBM in

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,309
multiple working groups and he's an open

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,230
group certified distinguished architect

00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:44,940
Raoul is also an IBM master inventor

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,120
with a dozen of research papers and

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,910
issued patents and so already brings us

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,410
closer to AI because this feature

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,239
sessions the latest of IBM's

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,899
announcements bringing AI capabilities

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,960
to data wherever it exists in the cloud

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,879
or hybrid data environments and so

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,400
infusing trust and transparency needed

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,619
from an industrial AI perspective into

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,030
any business process with confidence so

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,150
rule

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:17,400
over to you and in the session thank you

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:22,020
thank you so first of all I want to

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,920
welcome you all from IBM and thank you

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,009
Apple when I was told that there's a

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,189
chance for me to talk at the Lifelong

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,990
Learning Institute in Singapore to an

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,750
audience that is interested in open

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,420
source and artificial intelligence it

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,189
seemed like all of my key interests had

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,200
come together and it was nearly

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,110
impossible to say no to this opportunity

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,549
so I am thrilled to be here and I'm

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,119
thrilled to be speaking to an audience

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,909
of technologists and developers for a

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,329
long time we have been underappreciated

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,219
in many ways but this venue itself is

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,219
symptomatic of the changing landscape

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,780
from developers right this this takes me

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,479
back to when I was teaching graduate

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,360
school students and by virtue of just

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,370
the layout of this room we are forcing

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,260
all of the speakers to look up to their

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,330
developers right so this is

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,750
this is just an indication of how the

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,430
world is changing and more and more the

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,670
developers and the technologists are

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:27,510
leading the way so I want to talk to you

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,420
about IBM and IBM's contribution to AI

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,670
and if there's one thing that you can

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,640
take out of this talk is at the end of

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,500
the day I hope that I can show you how

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,180
IBM is essentially synonymous with

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,099
open-source and it's adoption for the

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,650
cloud for data and for AI so given all

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,299
of the powerful open source capabilities

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,450
particularly in the artificial

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,420
intelligence landscape you know what is

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,030
IBM stand why do clients need IBM to

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,950
participate in this particular landscape

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,260
and one of the ways to clearly depict

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,139
that is through what we refer to an IBM

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,060
as the AI ladder and this is sort of the

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,400
prescriptive guidance that we give to

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,250
our clients in terms of adoption for

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,139
artificial intelligence in computing we

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,780
often use the term garbage in garbage

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,870
out right artificial intelligence in

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,329
some sense is just as effective as the

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,849
data the training data the models and

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,440
the approaches that we take to it and so

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:34,019
you don't get to artificial intelligence

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,109
you know sort of as a as a boolean state

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,049
it's a transition from the current state

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,780
of a large enterprise or a large client

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,790
so there may be a lot of data you start

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,799
with collecting the right data making it

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,750
simple and accessible there's a

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,819
governance model that has to be layered

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,690
on top of that right who can access the

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,180
data how is it cataloged how do we get

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,799
the data scientists the data stewards

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,470
the application developers to

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,780
collaborate and work together to decide

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,209
what the right business outcomes are and

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,180
then the analytics that sits on top of

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,639
that and finally infusing the artificial

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,590
intelligence in existing business

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,220
processes and workflows so you could

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,849
have the best possible predictive model

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:23,909
for a certain business case but if you

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:26,600
don't apply it in the right workflow to

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:29,960
the right end user in the right user

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,600
texts it is often going to not be used

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,810
as effectively so the AI ladder really

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,590
helps you know large companies who have

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,050
large data estates transition up to

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,390
higher value to get to artificial

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,130
intelligence and we believe in a multi

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,960
cloud world right so towards the like

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,240
the right hand side what that graphic is

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,100
meant to illustrate is the reality of

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,770
the world is for most large companies

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,080
and large clients your data doesn't

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,330
reside in a single cloud or doesn't all

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,020
recite on-premise right it's often a mix

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:09,070
and it's scattered and we help help them

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:12,290
bring it together so there's two sort of

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,270
you know fundamental fallacy is that we

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,280
often help and we we use a lot of

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,840
open-source capabilities and I'll talk

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,150
about that through the rest of the talk

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,170
but the two common fallacies that we

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,690
talk to clients very commonly the first

00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,970
one is what I call moonshot or nothing

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,830
and this is where you know you have a

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,200
lofty goal in terms of the AI

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,180
capabilities that you want to bring but

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,310
you forget that there's a there's an

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,350
iterative collaborative journey to get

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,680
there right you you have to work hard

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,780
towards with your data with your cloud

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,060
infrastructure to deliver the AI in the

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,160
right form and that journey is often

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,860
overlooked and so we help clients with

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,930
that journey and the second thing which

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,600
is equally important as a fallacy is

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,100
what I call the one-and-done which means

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,590
because you built a predictive model

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,780
that that works within the data set that

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,610
you trained it on doesn't mean you're

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,650
done and you declare victory on your

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,960
artificial intelligence initiative right

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,850
you have to there's a care and feeding

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,700
of those systems that has to happen

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,040
consistently it has to be retrained it

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,170
has to be kept up to date with the real

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,350
world and we have a lot of those

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,920
capabilities all in the form and built

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,720
on top of open source tooling and

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,750
libraries and we bring it together our

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,420
fundamental central tenant as part of

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,120
our three principles for IBM's approach

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,860
it stands on open and this is not a

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,740
chart that was created for this

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,290
particular presentation this is part of

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,890
you know IBM strategy and an openness is

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,040
central and fundamental I'll give you a

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,890
few data points around that those of you

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,350
who have followed some of the work that

00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,030
IBM has done in in the context of

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,220
natural language understanding and

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,440
artificial intelligence are familiar

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,450
with our Grand Challenge which was the

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,940
Jeopardy Grand Challenge where the

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,740
Machine kind of competed with you know

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,010
two of the grandmasters of the best

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,320
folks at jeopardy but the important

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,300
point that I want to make as part of

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,270
that story and again this is almost 15

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,490
years ago at this point is even some of

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,160
the work that contributed to that Grand

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,460
Challenge was based on fundamentally

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,950
open principles and software that was

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,660
available in the open source community

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,170
so the unstructured information

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,820
management architecture or urema that

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,150
was part of something that we had

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,750
donated to Apache it was one piece of

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,920
the puzzle that went into the the

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,560
development of the jeopardy initiatives

00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,960
so we've been leading with contributions

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,830
to to open source just as we have been

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,440
consuming a lot of open source software

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,780
this is our sort of information

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,090
architecture a very high-level view that

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,560
you know from an IBM perspective the way

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,710
we talk about artificial intelligence

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,670
and openness is focused on all of these

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:12,710
layers so we believe that the future

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,960
relies very heavily on open communities

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,510
and open source and you will see that in

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,820
each layer of this architecture whether

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,580
it's the cloud layer at the bottom where

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,850
we're focusing on again open

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,040
infrastructures containers kubernetes to

00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:31,100
the data layer where a number of no SQL

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,650
databases and other data technologies

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,410
that are open source to the artificial

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,840
intelligence layer where we leverage a

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,660
lot of the open source tool kits and

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,660
libraries our entire stack from the

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:48,350
cloud onwards to delivering AI is all

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,200
based on open principles and and a lot

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,590
of opens that are software in tooling of

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,560
course

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,680
the IBM differentiation is to provide on

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,070
top of that a services consulting and

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,200
support a capable set of capabilities

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,720
that some of the largest companies and

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,330
clients really need so it's hard for a

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,060
very large enterprise to just pick up a

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,360
few open source libraries and manage the

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,020
entire lifecycle of taking AI into their

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,270
products the support that has to follow

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,070
beyond and really the the help in terms

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,020
of making the best use of some of the

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,300
open source capabilities and that's

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,130
where IBM helps with best practices

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,880
helps with support services and

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:35,340
consulting if you look at the top

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,070
workloads that IBM is involved in on our

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,570
IBM clouds and particularly workloads

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,310
that have to do with artificial

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,200
intelligence capabilities so that's

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,620
predictive models you know deep learning

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,630
models decision optimization type of

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,520
models you will see that all of those

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,160
workloads again

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,740
IBM leads with developing open

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,770
communities and leverages the the open

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,530
source software that exists so if you go

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,900
sort of clockwise from the top right and

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,880
blockchain of course the Linux

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,790
Foundation and the hyper ledger project

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,920
where some of the biggest contributors

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,260
if you look at the data fabric I talked

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,300
about you know no SQL and other types of

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,210
databases a lot of these have very

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,450
vibrant open source communities when we

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,440
talk about essentially cloud native

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,270
applications and modernizing

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,980
applications into microservices

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,520
architectures I mean we're talking about

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,200
containers and container orchestration

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,420
projects like kubernetes even though

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,100
VMware is proprietary you know when we

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,690
talk about embedding AI into these

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,850
processes there's a lot of open

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,430
communities that that we are involved in

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,430
and of course the the core machine

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:48,120
learning and AI capabilities and finally

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:51,060
IOT is another space which is you know

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,820
very vibrant in terms of in terms of

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,130
open community so IBM plays a pivotal

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,380
role in in some of these communities and

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,480
making these contributions and really

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,089
again helping our clients with the

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,620
adoption of open-source in the context

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:08,260
of cloud data and

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,030
this is just a simple illustration you

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,830
know I'm a member of the Apache Software

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,590
Foundation but there's a lot of other

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,990
contributors within IBM and you will see

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,000
that you know we really focus within the

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,560
data and AI space in particular on

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,390
making some of these contributions

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,760
widely available to the community

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,500
there's some statistics at the bottom

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,140
out of the Linux Foundation Kaggle and

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,630
Gardiner and you will see how you know

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,050
open-source is really fundamental in

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:39,280
terms of in terms of quick acceleration

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:41,080
and adoption of these technologies this

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,240
will be preaching to the choir so I'm

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,490
not going to actually talk about this

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,830
chart other than to say that we all know

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,190
that development of AI and development

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,080
of predictive and deep learning models

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,120
involves a very sophisticated and

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,250
iterative process something there

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,110
there's a lot of due diligence

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,880
especially that you have to look into in

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,220
order to make sure that the models that

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,650
you're building are essentially fair and

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,850
essentially are explainable and you can

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:12,310
show in in a regulatory or other context

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,470
why certain decisions were made and all

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,950
of that has to be really governed in a

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,290
very well orchestrated fashion so the

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,210
way IBM actually helps with that and

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,690
that previous life cycle was true

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:28,060
irrespective of you know what tooling or

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:31,240
libraries you're using where IBM helps

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:35,110
is with that end-to-end governance for

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,750
AI we provide a set of tools including

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,020
you know Watson studio if you heard of

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,120
it

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,630
if you're not I would suggest you you

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,240
certainly check it out it is essentially

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,880
you can think of it as your IDE for AI

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,880
right it allows you to bring together a

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,190
variety of open-source capabilities as

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,070
well as IBM proprietary capable that is

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,170
together in terms of the development of

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,360
your predictive and deep learning or

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,700
decision optimization models and it

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,560
allows you to do that in a collaborative

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,420
fashion where you can work with your

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,970
data scientists your data stewards your

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,830
application developers and your your

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,650
business analysts to deliver the right

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,540
outcome now some of this when you

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,709
essentially get started with with

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,470
hacking together

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:23,410
a imodels you know it might seem very

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,540
far off in terms of interacting with all

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,480
of these different personas but when you

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,149
talk about large companies and large

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,980
enterprises this is very much a real

00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,559
problem right most of those are not

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,769
single person or two person shops

00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,809
there's there's very you know there's

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:43,269
very much a collaborative model that has

00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:45,129
to be put in place and we provide with

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,709
that end-to-end tooling that allows for

00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,199
that once you use Watson studio to

00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:52,360
actually build your models you can use

00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,069
Watson machine learning or any number of

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,319
our new model serve engines to

00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:58,869
essentially serve those models to deploy

00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:00,910
those models so that they can make start

00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:03,850
making those predictions either in cloud

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,809
or on your premise and there's obviously

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,689
a cycle of continuous learning that has

00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:12,309
to happen when your model is deployed

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:14,379
part of it is in Watson machine learning

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,199
and part of it is in what we call Watson

00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:20,920
open scale and what open scale does is

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,449
as at run time not at Build time for the

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,189
models not when you're training the

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:25,959
model but when you have the model

00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:28,899
deployed and it's making the product

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,839
predictions it allows you to monitor

00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:35,350
that runtime performance of that model

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,449
and give you you know subtle indications

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,790
as to when you know some part of that

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,519
model might have drifted away and you

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,910
need to retrain the model it also allows

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,589
for all of those capabilities around

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,199
being able to explain the decisions that

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:52,059
the model is making as well as showing

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,699
that your model is essentially fair

00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:56,290
across all of the feature spaces that

00:14:54,699 --> 00:15:00,240
are involved in making that prediction

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:03,279
and these are very very much

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,059
fundamentally important principles for

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,399
any enterprise to adopt AI and you know

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:11,439
we provide the tooling built on top of

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,980
all of the open source capabilities to

00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:18,040
do that this is a slightly different

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,049
view of the same picture but this view

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,709
actually talks a little bit about the

00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:27,339
IBM portfolio right so IBM cloud private

00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:30,399
for data is essentially our

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:33,100
data infrastructure layer and it sits on

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,209
top of any cloud so you can take this

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,160
entire stack to Azure you can take it to

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,560
Amazon you can take it to the IBM cloud

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,160
or you can take it on premise on your

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,559
own hardware it allows for that sort of

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,809
portability if you will in terms of the

00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,029
deployment infrastructure and sitting on

00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:53,709
top of that I talked about studio and

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,199
machine learning and open scale right

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:58,240
now and the value that it provides but

00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,800
we also provide in the context in the

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,470
spirit of transfer learning and

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,649
pre-trained capabilities we have a lot

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,829
of pre trained api's that can really

00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:11,019
accelerate the development of AI based

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,300
applications and particularly if you're

00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:17,079
looking at things like natural language

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,689
understanding right so I did project

00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,819
where we used some of those AI

00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:24,149
capabilities to really understand the

00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:27,100
tax code and it's it's a pretty enormous

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,279
piece of work but we were able to do

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,199
that because we were able to train our

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,959
AI and our natural language

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,089
understanding capabilities using custom

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,910
statistical language models that were

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,670
built using our tooling that understood

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,949
what you know a deduction means in the

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,870
context of personal income tax or what a

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:51,339
move means in the context of personal

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:54,699
income tax right so it really has a lot

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,620
of you know potential in terms of

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,689
accelerating how you get to end value

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,879
and those are the services that sit on

00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,329
top all of these of course are available

00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,600
as api's you can try them out today on

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,449
the IBM cloud you can you can get a you

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,909
can subscribe there's a 30-day trial and

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,559
you can try out all of these services

00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:17,319
there's a hackathon three-day hackathon

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,579
that's planned as part of this event and

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,100
I would certainly welcome you to

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,929
participate in that and finally on top

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,140
we provide some essentially what we call

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,149
applications which are a set of

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,909
capabilities that are focused on

00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:33,520
delivering certain AI against certain AI

00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:37,440
use cases so what's an assistant for

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,400
example allows you to very easily build

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,630
conversational AI solution

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,600
where you're essentially having a

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,059
dialogue or a back-and-forth with with

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,260
your end-users and discovery allows you

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:52,660
to really search and explore into large

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,670
document corpora which would otherwise

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:58,840
be very hard for you to make sense of

00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:03,760
and extract insights from it now the

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:06,309
entire what's in AI suite or the IBM

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,410
data in AI suite leverages through

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:12,370
Watson studio all of these open source

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:15,370
capabilities so it's not a you know

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,380
either use the proprietary capability or

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,360
the open source capability right it's a

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,429
harmonious relationship and using our

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,520
tooling like Watson studio it comes

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:26,440
together so if for you use case you can

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,170
use the open source libraries and that's

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,420
all you need that's great if you want to

00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,309
leverage some of the Watson API is those

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,890
are available for you and there may be

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,480
some cases where all you do is you use

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,190
the Watson assistant or some other

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,440
Watson API is because that's what you're

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,140
interested in so all of these models of

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,429
interactions are fully supported using

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,590
using the tooling now I mentioned that

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,390
you know it's one thing to use Watson AI

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,400
capabilities and open-source

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,050
capabilities and how our tooling is

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,309
based on open source and you can

00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,830
leverage a lot of open source

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:02,620
capabilities but what about give back

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,050
right I mean how what are we doing to

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,910
really advance the state of the art with

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,400
respect to artificial intelligence and

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,929
the way most of our communities open

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,100
communities look at artificial

00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:19,270
intelligence so we donate a lot of our

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,520
technology in various open source for us

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,380
and these are just few examples that I

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,050
have on the screen of libraries that we

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,630
have essentially made available in an

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,120
open source capacity the first one is

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,210
the AI fairness 360 toolkit that you

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,300
know is I talked about model fairness

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:41,050
these this is really critical

00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,600
a lot of AI today is making decisions

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,150
that really affect people's lives in

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,140
fundamental manners right you may have

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,970
heard about AI that makes decisions

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,570
about whether people get some type of

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,700
more

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,149
you're alone you may have heard about AI

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,620
which is involved in the decision-making

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,409
process about whether somebody who is

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:05,309
incarcerated gets out on parole you may

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:09,669
have heard about AI where it's really

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:11,620
advising an oncologist in terms of what

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,889
possible treatment models may be

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:18,809
available to to a particular person with

00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:21,639
cancer and all of these are really

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,860
really important decisions and the

00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:26,980
aspect of fairness around some of these

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,809
decisions you cannot under play that one

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,720
bit right so that's what the fairness

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:35,529
360 toolkit does the adversarial

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,720
robustness toolkit is really around you

00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:40,179
know how do you protect your machine

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,610
learning and predictive models against

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,220
sort of malicious attacks and you know

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,230
all of you have probably seen the lion

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,840
example where you know it's you're

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,000
trying to classify whether something in

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,559
an image as a wolf or a dog and you

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,559
actually find out that the machine

00:20:53,559 --> 00:21:00,519
learning image recognition algorithm is

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,080
really focusing on snow being in the

00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:06,000
picture and if there's a lot of snow

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,919
it's it's deemed to be a wolf and if you

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,929
find ways in which you can extract these

00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,529
type of deficiencies out of model and

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,169
then exploit them in various cases that

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:20,049
obviously can lead to some very unsavory

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:21,759
outcomes in the real world and so we we

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:24,340
provide this toolkit to be able to

00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,950
mitigate against those types of those

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,809
types of attacks and finally our fabric

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,879
for deep learning we want to democratize

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,440
deep learning deep learning still the

00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:36,460
development of you know deep neural

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,230
networks is it's hard to access some of

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,600
the the hardware and the infrastructure

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,059
capabilities needed to run and train

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,370
these models at scale and we're making

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,440
all of these available on the on the IBM

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,779
cloud and indeed other clouds and we're

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,710
making it such that the toolkit is

00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:57,789
available as a fabric and an open-source

00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:01,240
library yes so one of the last things

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,549
and this is is the we create a

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,310
repository of models to allow for

00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:09,700
sharing of predictive models and

00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,680
this really almost always you have to

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,530
use a fit for purpose model that is

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,520
trained by data and for the right

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,040
algorithm and perhaps it's an ensemble

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,050
model for the purpose but you can get

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,710
started quickly through this model asset

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:27,250
exchange so I'll end on this chart again

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,740
I hope that having seen some of this

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,230
when you think of IBM you think of

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,710
something that is synonymous the entity

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,300
that is synonymous with bringing

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,330
open-source to the enterprise in the

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,850
context of Cloud Data Nai right that's

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,300
where IBM's you know it's a fundamental

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,010
central tenant to IBM's mission and

00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,020
there's a lot of opportunity for you to

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,390
engage with us more deeply beyond this

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,370
this talk we have number of speaking

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,220
sessions we have two hands-on workshops

00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,010
I would very much recommend that those

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,440
workshops focus on aspects that we have

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:05,560
talked about and finally I did mention

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,480
the hackathon the hackathon is actually

00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,300
something that we are supporting through

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,300
a period of three days there's an

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,300
interesting contest in and some prizes

00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,130
at the end of it so I would certainly

00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,540
ask that you check it out thank you so

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,950
much for your time it was great to be

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:27,509
here

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:27,509
