Natural Language Generation is positioned as one of the next generation of disruptors in the data consumption space. Rather than have analysts interpret data, we remove the gatekeepers and use machine learning to summarise insights and convert them into textual narratives and stories.

Today, this technology is nascent, but very much a reality. Weather forecasts, financial research, stock market data, sales data, medical research -- all of these have seen applications of automated narratives. Recent research includes an experiment which showed that users sometimes preferred computer-generated weather forecasts to human-written ones, in part because the computer forecasts used more consistent terminology.

This talk shares some of the successful examples of natural language generation, the techniques and libraries behind these, and how you can incorporate narratives into your data analysis.
