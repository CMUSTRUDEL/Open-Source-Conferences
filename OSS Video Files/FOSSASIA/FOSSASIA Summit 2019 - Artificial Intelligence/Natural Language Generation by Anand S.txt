Natural Language Generation is positioned as one of the next generation of disruptors in the data consumption space. Rather than have analysts interpret data, we remove the gatekeepers and use machine learning to summarise insights and convert them into textual narratives and stories.

Today, this technology is nascent, but very much a reality. Weather forecasts, financial research, stock market data, sales data, medical research -- all of these have seen applications of automated narratives. Recent research includes an experiment which showed that users sometimes preferred computer-generated weather forecasts to human-written ones, in part because the computer forecasts used more consistent terminology.

This talk shares some of the successful examples of natural language generation, the techniques and libraries behind these, and how you can incorporate narratives into your data analysis.

photos photo up I'd like to introduce

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,929
Anan s he's one of India's top data

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,420
scientists and he's here to talk about

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,549
natural anak language generation

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,440
one other note I'd like to remind

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,840
everybody at noon after this talk

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,390
there's a group photo in the main

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:36,960
lecture hall which if we just follow the

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:40,050
crowd will find it I know a little soft

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,719
okay I can be a little louder maybe

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,160
about that loud

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,480
great thanks so we're going to be

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,649
talking about natural language

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,180
generation but first we're gonna be

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,980
talking about why we need it in the

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,930
first place we love creating some fairly

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,120
complex visuals at random and one of the

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,270
things that we did for a client who

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,120
asked us tell me why my workflow is

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,760
delayed was put together this little

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,430
visual which said look your process goes

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
from a draft stage to a submitted stage

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,960
and then to waiting for approval and

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,580
then plat and so on so these are the

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,880
stages that your document goes through

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,710
and the size of each of these circles is

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,320
how many documents are waiting at that

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,270
stage and the color represents how long

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,640
the documents have been waiting there so

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,170
the red circle which is completed is all

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,880
of those documents that I've gone all

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,560
the way to competed but haven't been

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,720
closed and I'm just sitting there for a

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,270
very long time and the flows here

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,100
represent the transitions from one state

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,689
to another so from planning there's a

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,549
whole lot of stuff that seems to be

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,890
going into in progress and from in

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,750
progress they largely go to complete or

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,390
to closed when going forward but there's

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,299
a big chunk that's going backwards all

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,579
the way to submit it meaning that they

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,409
go right to in progress and then get

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,450
resubmitted which is clearly a problem

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,700
and this is also a relatively slow step

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,729
and with this what they were able to

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,770
figure out was that all of the forward

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,020
flows the ones that were on top that is

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,450
documents going from left to right those

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,400
seem to be going fast and the documents

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,080
that were going from right to left that

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,410
is where they're going backwards they

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,030
seem

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,310
be going slow so this was an

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,620
organization that had a problem where

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,930
the forward flows were fine they were

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,580
doing things fast but the trouble was

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,260
they were doing things they were doing

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,500
the wrong things and therefore stuff had

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,720
to get resubmitted now what I've done is

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,460
compressed approximately half an hour's

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
worth of explanation into about a

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,650
minutes worth of explanation and there's

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,270
just no hope in hell that anyone has of

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,220
being able to figure out this visual

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:47,340
without that explanation it's cool but

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,740
it's not simple and this is among the

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,040
more complex explanations I have had

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,660
people stare at simple tab tables simple

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,120
bar charts uni-dimensional bar charts

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,010
and ask the question so what am I

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,980
supposed to do with this in fact there

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,350
is an entire industry of people whose

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,450
job it is to take the analysis at

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,820
somebody's jump and interpret it for the

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,860
app for the other person and the boss

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,710
just says look tell me what I should do

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,060
and then if I disagree I will ask you

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,280
why and then give me the supporting

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,560
evidence and if you need to go deeper

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,380
we'll do that

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,209
question is can we automate that can we

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,060
take the stuff that the person is doing

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,910
in the middle and communicate that to

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,220
the end audience well what does the

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,660
person in the middle do well half the

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,670
time for most of the time they're really

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,140
just talking so it's words more than

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,510
anything else which is where the natural

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,640
language part comes in but it's not only

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,080
words this more to it than that but what

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,180
I'm gonna be focusing on is just the

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,360
words part of it let's start with some

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,120
simple stuff we were working with the

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,370
state of uttar pradesh and they said we

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,360
want a dashboard that shows what we

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
should be doing from a health

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
perspective it showed a series of

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,840
metrics like what's the ratio of

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,489
pentavalent 3 to BCG percentage of pw

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,230
screen for HIV I have no idea what these

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,510
measures are I'm not a medical person

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,760
but it effectively showed what the

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,890
performance of each of the districts was

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,900
and what the district health

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,660
administrator said was apart from this

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,310
just give me a summary that tells me in

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,470
English what's happening

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,810
so this summary says based on the latest

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,729
data refresh in Jan 19 so that tells me

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,180
how old or new this is othor Pradesh has

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,330
a

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,880
it's core of 0.41 your best indicator is

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,440
the ratio of this to this which

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,750
hopefully they'll understand that has a

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,160
score of one point zero three as compact

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,479
the last month now ideally this should

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,310
have been worded as three percent higher

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,229
than last month right that's how humans

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,490
talk but this isn't a particularly good

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,370
reporting that's why I'm starting with

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,410
this a very base one the next best

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,300
performing indicator is this which has a

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,120
score of thirty five point five five as

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,650
compared to last month here are your top

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,110
performing districts here are your worst

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,530
performing districts now the reason I'm

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:05,009
showing you this is because these five

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,479
lines where the five things that the

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,639
district health administrator said they

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,470
really wanted to know when we asked them

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,289
why are you looking at all of this data

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,849
what action will you finally take they

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,889
said see we want to know where we're

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,570
doing well so we can tell our bosses we

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,280
want to know where we're doing bad so

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,720
that we can drive the people we wanna

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,990
know how we're doing compared to our

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,669
peers that's it these are the questions

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,620
we want answered and if you can just

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,320
give us those answers the rest of it is

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,479
just proof which we'll get to when we

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,090
want to talk to somebody that's a real

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,490
simple templatized summary because we

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,340
said we're gonna put this in generate

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,229
this using a program and the numbers are

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,760
reasonably straightforward the text is

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,550
fairly straightforward generate but for

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,220
grammatical errors and numerical errors

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:55,199
this can be done in a way that you can

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,970
see how it can be done from data let me

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,060
take another report that we created

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,560
there is a doing business report that

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,810
the World Bank generates this is a

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,940
report it has information around how

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,740
easy is it to do business how easy to

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,320
start a business how easy is it to deal

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,080
with construction permits and so on

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:24,570
across various countries so I searched

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:26,550
for Singapore for instance which let me

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,710
take the answer to the question how easy

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,479
is it to start a business now each of

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,699
these little bubbles represents one

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,800
country and the country that's easiest

00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,979
to do very easiest to start a business

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,719
in is New Zealand which is in East Asia

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,889
and the Pacific followed by Canada

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:43,650
followed by Hong Kong

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,449
and so on and that's the quantitative

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,219
information but apart from that there's

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,659
a little summary here and I'm gonna

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:50,219
focus on the one on the bottom right it

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,900
says that the time taken to complete a

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:54,060
procedure with regards to starting a

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,650
business is half a day in New Zealand

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,039
whereas in Venezuela that would take you

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,729
230 days an interesting side tidbit that

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,349
augments what we are in this or for

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:06,180
instance India is among the bottom ten

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,729
with regard to dealing with construction

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,889
permits or when it comes to getting

00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,629
electricity setting up an electricity

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,310
connection in South Korea it takes less

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:16,439
time and effort but the process is very

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,330
painful in Bangladesh and Venezuela

00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,129
which ranked the lowest electricity is

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,500
gold to Venezuela and it costs you about

00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,680
seven and four cents per kilo kilowatt

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,330
hour whereas the next highest is where

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,240
it costs just 67 cents and that's a

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,240
factor of ten reduction already there

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,159
these are not entirely automatically

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,050
constructed there is a certain amount of

00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,300
manual intervention in two ways the

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,340
first is we know exactly what these

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,110
categories are so this is related to

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,819
electricity so we have the option of

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,589
talking about electricity related stuff

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,479
and coming up with anecdotes that are

00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,550
specifically electricity related

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,629
secondly the data doesn't change oftener

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,940
than once a year

00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,830
so what we can do is have a base layer

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,169
and say throw out some automated stuff

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,360
but then on top of that allow people to

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,370
override with comments and corrections

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,110
that they want in specific area so you

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,120
have a base case which at least

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,979
generates some meaningful stuff if not

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,240
interesting or useful and we have

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,430
specific areas where people can

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,830
intervene and put in interesting

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,439
observations on top of that we're still

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,870
at the realm of semi automation I kind

00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,610
of get some basic stuff but we are able

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,029
to go a little further than that and

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:26,400
improve on it manually is there a way in

00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:29,250
which we can make this dynamic that is

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,719
what we have is for static data the

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,640
option of creating these kind of stuff

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,860
these kind of templates could this be

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,630
done entirely dynamically let me tell

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,219
you a fairly interesting scenario that

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:45,990
we were working on we had data in it for

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,339
about 200,000 students for whom there

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,990
was a large survey that was done the

00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,029
survey effectively had information on

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,120
that performance which is the marks as

00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,630
well as on their behavior how often they

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,340
watch TV

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,020
how often do they play games what are

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,500
their parents educational

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,840
characteristics what are their let's say

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,940
reading habits and so on so these are

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,680
some of the factors that were there and

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,720
we started exploring these so for

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,600
example what is the impact of watching

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,610
television on let's say pick a parameter

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,580
science turns out that children who

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,440
never watch television tend to score the

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,840
lowest whereas children who watch TV

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,140
once a month do a bit better once a week

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,150
do a bit better and watch every day tend

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,400
to do slightly worse so which means that

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,410
TV watching in moderation seems to be

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,110
the answer roughly once a week which is

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,790
also the answer for social science watch

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,100
TV once a week seems to be about the

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,320
best but that is not true

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,790
for reading habits because the more you

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
watch TV the better your reading ability

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,530
becomes and these are statistically

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,120
significant incidentally mathematics is

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,840
perhaps the more interesting one it

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,600
turns out that TV just kills your

00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,670
mathematical ability between watching TV

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,010
once a week or once a month or never

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,390
watching TV every day is even worse this

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,400
is particularly surprising because the

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,420
children who don't watch TV at all are

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,980
usually the ones that don't have

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,290
television and they are economically

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,390
disadvantaged in any case watching TV

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,610
every day puts your mathematical ability

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,030
worse and even those kids that's saying

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,740
something but now this is narrated in a

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,450
simple templatized way below saying

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,560
watching TV can improve your maths marks

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,720
or the right kind of watching TV

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,510
behavior by as much as 1.5 percent

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,250
that's the gap between here and here

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,840
the once-a-week watching TV is best

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,670
students score about 33 point 4 whereas

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,530
every day is the worst student score

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,870
31.9% you can see how this is

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,940
constructed just say what's the best

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,490
what's the worst what's the gap and tell

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,560
people what's happening and this kind of

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,940
an annotation is present for every

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,040
single one of these and you also make a

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,950
commentary about whether this is common

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,960
so it turns out that for watching TV for

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,330
reading watching TV every day is the

00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,860
most common behavior 66 67 percent of

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,240
the students exhibit that behavior and

00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,410
you add a comment saying luckily every

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,930
day is the most common

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,160
whereas for mathematics every day is the

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,560
most common and that is the worst

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,900
behavior so you see sadly this is the

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,490
wrong behavior that you exhibit so we

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,720
bring in a certain amount of emotion

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,880
to this as well and I will be talking

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,060
more about emotion generation as we go

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,550
and still an experimental topic now this

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,850
can be abstracted out into a master

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,740
summary which says that if I look at how

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,930
much each of these factors influence so

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,700
watching TV turns out that it influenced

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,410
between two to five percent of your

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,390
marks playing games

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,410
influenced about two to five percent of

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,750
your marks but the factors that

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,700
influence your marks overall father's

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,130
education occupation mother's education

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,690
and occupation the fact make the largest

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,580
difference and that's another kind of

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,810
summary that says here are the factors

00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,330
that influence your marks

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,860
as an administrator I would just look at

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,330
this column on the left and say here are

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,060
the factors that influenced me most here

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,100
that influence least and these are the

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,380
subjects that are influenced by the

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,930
various factors which can be filtered

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,210
dynamically based on students that are

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,310
below poverty above poverty so if I want

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,380
to look at just the boys is there a

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,090
difference between boys and girls in

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,830
terms of what are the factors that

00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,280
affect them it turns out that there is

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:14,370
we go to the details of that and the

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,700
template and the narration automatically

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:21,120
get adjusted for these statements so all

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,550
of this stuff that's coming in since its

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:29,850
automated you can do it at any level of

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:32,370
data for anything there is not that you

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,100
create that cannot be annotated at least

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,590
by a simple summary that explains what

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:46,590
it is like this to the next logical step

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:48,360
before that is it okay how we solved our

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,690
original problem which is this plug

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,600
graph right at that one had a bigger

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,670
issue so we were also looking to explain

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,740
what are the factors that were driving

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,710
the cause of delay so it turned out that

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,690
for example the service requests that

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,760
came from certain divisions certain

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,070
customers certain entities where huge

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,930
problems and it didn't matter which

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,310
organization they came from which side

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,520
they came from which country they came

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:17,430
from so we put in a summary of what is

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,080
really causing the delay in text which

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,360
made it a whole lot easier for people to

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,649
read understand and figure out and they

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
the day all they had to really do was

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,410
read the summary and just say okay

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,570
here's some pretty picture I don't

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,029
really understand it but if I get the

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,880
text that's fine that's in fact how it

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:37,290
ended up getting used but we can't take

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:50,019
this forward to a dynamic space as well

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:52,990
actually I'm gonna skip this one on the

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:56,680
right hand side is a visualization of

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,420
the impact of the budget of the budget

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,930
that was announced in India every year

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,370
on the day of the budget so the budget

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,990
is announced during the day the stock

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,820
prices move during the day the

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,260
difference in stock prices between the

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,810
morning and the evening ought to be

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,240
precise the market capitalization is

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,700
what the chart on the right shows now

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,529
the size of the box here represents the

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,820
market capitalization of the industry so

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,750
this is banking and financial services

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:25,450
within which there are asset companies

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,699
these are the oil and gas companies and

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,709
that's the sector so the size represents

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,660
the market capitalization and the color

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,000
represents how much it's changed whether

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,209
it's increased or decreased so it turns

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,970
out that in this graph on the 28th of

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:43,720
February 2005 which is the budget day

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,730
the market grew by about 1.6 percent 18

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,649
of these sectors crew that's in green

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,649
and four of them shrank that's the ones

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:54,370
in red or orange BFS I grew the most by

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:55,360
about 3% oil and gas grew by about 1.7

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,980
percent that's the second largest

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,800
services was the one that was most

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,220
impacted by detail and real estate which

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,140
shrunk by about 1.4 percent the one that

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,750
had the highest growth the greenest one

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,720
is food and beverages followed and the

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,120
one that had the drop was services which

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,459
is the reddest what I'm doing is

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,829
literally reading off off the left which

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:19,990
is exactly the way in which we want

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:22,600
people to be talking through a visual or

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,670
a set of numbers as well so what this

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,940
does is more than the technology behind

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,190
it it's really something that makes it

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,420
independent of the interpreter the

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,760
person who sits in the middle

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,040
understands the analysis and says

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,930
something needs to follow a script

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,280
so that brings in a certain amount of

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,100
standardization people say the same

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,100
thing and you don't need much by way of

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,900
training to have to read this stuff what

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,270
this means is that it also makes it

00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,550
possible to put this kind of stuff to a

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:54,400
much larger audience the public for

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,230
instance media we are working with news

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,840
organizations in the media to see if we

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,930
can create visuals on television digital

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,790
as well as print that are entirely self

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,230
explanatory to the point where no one

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,790
needs to interpret them but at the same

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,040
time don't compromise on the

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,270
sophistication of the message the way in

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,950
which we communicate the message it

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,180
could be complex analysis it be complex

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,970
numbers it could be complex take a

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,850
complex charts but provide the

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,680
annotation along with it in preferably a

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:25,150
manual way because automated way because

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,400
that saves the effort and this can be

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,830
taken to an extreme one retailers said

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,860
look what we do is create PowerPoint

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,120
presentations out of these charts there

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,760
is a chart system we create a

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,200
presentation can you automate that we

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,780
said well there's a couple of ways of

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,120
doing that one way is to automate the

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,160
generation of PowerPoint itself which is

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,670
interesting so I'm going to give you an

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,860
aside on that it is entirely possible to

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,980
come up with an interactive PowerPoint

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,180
presentation that can tell a story this

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,350
one doesn't have narratives but I am

00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,630
still going to talk about it this is a

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:02,050
dynamically generated presentation where

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,900
the the sales revenue of a retailer is

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,329
broken up by geography within which by

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,949
channel within which by product against

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,079
which you have how well it's doing in

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,720
that region the red is not so good

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,579
yellow is kind of ok green is you're

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,010
doing well and you can see that for

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:21,130
example in UK in the stores channel

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,390
product 9 is not doing so well so we can

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,800
ask the question why is that happening

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,290
is it because product lines generally

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,780
not doing well click on that that does a

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,760
drillin in PowerPoint into product nine

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,200
shows a breakup and if we find that

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,970
product line is not doing well almost

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,710
anywhere the only place where it's kind

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,750
of doing well is in the US stores

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,060
channel is that because US is generally

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,550
doing well click that takes you to the

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,810
US and shows your breakup of the US and

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,840
you can click on pretty much any spot

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:48,070
and get in there or another way of

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:55,240
looking at this

00:17:48,070 --> 00:18:06,640
is let's take that of looking at

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:08,410
interactive visuals in PowerPoint okay

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,140
what we have here is the breakup of

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,910
downloads from an app store by geography

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,010
most of the downloads came from the US

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,200
followed by China followed by Germany by

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,270
model Android for versus iOS 4 and you

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,890
can see that Sarah little behold visual

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,780
by category where games mostly

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,550
downloaded or was it educational apps

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,780
that were downloaded and so on and we

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,060
can start exploring where these

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,570
downloads came from so Android for

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,610
downloads mostly came through games the

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,200
games downloads mostly came from the

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,420
newbie segments and the double income no

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,360
kids segment and these two are segments

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,890
that are not growing now this allows us

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,600
to perform pretty much full-fledged

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,970
sophisticated explorations in PowerPoint

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,640
itself so the challenge of generating

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,620
PowerPoint that does sophisticated

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,320
interactive visualizations is not the

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,170
problem the problem however is that this

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,060
still requires an explanation and can we

00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,980
provide that explanation which is what

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,210
PowerPoint does manually so we put

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,660
together a dashboard like with this

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,800
which mirrored what our clients normally

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,440
used for their an hour for their sales

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,820
analysis it says look retailer number

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,980
six that's the anonymous name of the

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,930
retailer here are your insights for the

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,210
week for week number one in 2015 your

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,340
sales improved this week but it's dipped

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,310
compared to the same period last year if

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,110
you look at the US retail division then

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,790
your sales improved but again has dipped

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,040
compared to the same period last year if

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,140
you look at where your growth came from

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:34,210
by product it mostly came from this

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:36,760
brand 0 to 4 Inc last form 50p whatever

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,860
that product is and if you look at one

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,990
other subdivision then it's mostly your

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,730
ring view binder that grew that

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,180
increased your sales now we can start

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,920
drilling in into this which could answer

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,630
the question how exactly did my sales

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,090
improve but dip compared to the previous

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,620
week that has a set of narratives that

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,070
go into the next level of detail my

00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,490
sales grew by almost 150% this week but

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,549
the same week last year it was eleven

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,169
point two percent higher

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,929
we're less and you can see the numbers

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:08,539
against in the charts just here and

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,129
there which allows me to drill down one

00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,779
level further so what exactly was a

00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:13,100
growth driven by which were the products

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:17,169
that grew which were the products that

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,169
