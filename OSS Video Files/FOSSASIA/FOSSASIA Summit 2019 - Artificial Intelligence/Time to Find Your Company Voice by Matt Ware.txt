Description: 
	16 March 2019 13:30, Event Hall 2-1

This session is dedicated to answering the important questions companies need to ask before deciding to build a Voice Assistant and then talking through the journey to deliver one to market.

The most important questions to ask before you start are:

·       Do you even need a Voice Assistant

·       Which Platform should you build yours on (Alexa, Google, Apple etc)

·       What is the company Objective

·       What Problem are you trying to solve for your customers

Once the above have been answered a plan needs to be developed for building and measurement of the Assistant:

·       Which internal Stakeholders need to be involved (IT, Marketing, Customer Service etc)

·       What is the Call to Action (CTA)

·       Do you have a defined Brand Persona/Voice and how do you bring this to the Assistant

·       What APIs are available and, if you don’t have any, can you use Live Data

·       What does Success look like for this Assistant

·       How will you Measure performance

·       Who will own the Assistant post launch

Lastly we will then walk through the Conversational Development Process to show:

·       How to write conversations for Assistants

·       What a Context is and how to use them to anchor conversations to customer Goals

·       Examples of Voice Intents and how to craft customer journeys in a Voice environment

·       When Screen devices can be used and how to build Rich Cards to complement Voice interactions

·       Other functions in Assistants such as Transactions, Email Sending, Video Casting, Map Directions, Pre Ordering (Voice to Collect) and other Actions

Attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of the Voice ecosystem, how it can be applied to their business as well as the building blocks to go back to their own company and start a discussion about where Voice may fit into their company plans plus how to start developing an Assistant

around determining if you actually need

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,700
one or not there's been a small

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,500
adjustment to the presentation in

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,480
between when this was accepted and now

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,880
we actually had one of our clients which

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,290
is came up out of Australia for those of

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,199
you who aren't aware it's a very large

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,730
bricks and mortar an online retailer and

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,119
they gave us permission to be able to

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,039
actually use the use case that we built

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,320
for them as the foundation for the

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,390
presentations this means that instead of

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,369
just talking theory there will be some

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,960
examples given of what was built why it

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,410
was built the process that's been gone

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,120
through use case design development

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,120
conversational design tracking learnings

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,200
and next steps so I'm hopeful that

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
that's going to give you a little bit

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,170
more insight than me just talking about

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,640
what the market itself looks like

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,530
usually I give this presentation in

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,020
partnership with my creative director

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,520
and we try and get people to figure out

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,590
which one of us each of these is

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,539
obviously with him not here it'll make

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,399
it easier and I'll just tell you I am

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,129
the one who obviously as a child thought

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,870
maths was cool but in down the street

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,520
with a t-shirt on math you can imagine I

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,380
was a very popular child so just to give

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,299
a bit of background around the industry

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,850
as a whole and why it is that we

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,430
actually even started doing this we as

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,580
an agency started out in 99 primarily

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,670
doing SEO and then we moved over into UX

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,580
design and development so software and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,430
website development however Australia

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,920
had smart speakers and Google launched

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,380
in the middle of 2017 it was actually

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,670
presented in partnership with us the day

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,590
that it was launched Google and I were

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,329
on stage we were supposed to be doing a

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,610
presentation on machine learning for

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,930
retail and that morning they told me

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,100
they were launching Google home into

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,079
Australia and they were taking the

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,790
presentation and doing that instead a

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,689
little bit of a pain because we'd spent

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,820
a lot of time developing that

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,200
presentation but we got the chance to

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,350
present it and launched into Australia

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,060
which not many people get so Australia

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,189
is actually the second fastest when it

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,719
comes to adoption of smart speakers or

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,360
more correctly digital foreign

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,460
assistance we managed to get to around

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,560
about five percent penetration inside of

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,500
one year so this was q1 2018 we have

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,360
just completed a

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,060
and consumer adoptions abroad for

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,130
Australia and now in the capital cities

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,860
it looks like it's closer to 30 percent

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,200
as an adoption rate so this is an

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,940
important step because these are people

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,950
who have actually gone out and made a

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,459
conscious decision to buy a smart

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,280
speaker now when we talk about digital

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,750
assistance and the medium of voice I

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,450
always like to touch upon the fact that

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,280
this is a little bit of a misnomer

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,410
digital assistants live inside of

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,090
devices and can be accessed via voice as

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,270
one of the mediums however they're also

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,090
able to be accessed via text anybody who

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,670
has a Android phone will have Google

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,650
assistant as a native device Apple

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,260
phones of course have Siri but you can

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,360
also add on to that the Google assistant

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,300
is an app Samsung devices are now

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,940
rolling out bixby by Drew has its own

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,400
voice speaker system says does Ali genie

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,040
for the Ali Baba side of things

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,230
they're also Cortana out of Microsoft so

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,970
these are devices that are able to be

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,680
accessed through speakers that are more

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,430
correctly a digital assistant they're

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,080
multimodal so when it comes to

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,910
developing these though the thought

00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,769
process that needs to go through is what

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,920
are you actually going to be doing for

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,600
your consumer or your user and we tend

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,630
to think of these things primarily as a

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,370
utility most people were kind of

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,450
conditioned by Amazon with the launch of

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:42,170
Alexa to go and do a single task turn on

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:45,220
a light change the station reorder paper

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,930
these are utility based tasks however

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,910
the secret to these actually lives

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,130
inside of the name their digital

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,239
assistants so as you're building them

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,190
you want to be able to build something

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,180
that can go under the process of tell me

00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,040
or help me or guide me or find me so

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,120
what this means is that you're building

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,250
something that can tell you a simple

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,769
piece of information it can help you

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,660
achieve an outcome it can guide you to

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:12,549
be able to do something or it can find

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,470
something for you if you talk to it and

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:18,290
as I mentioned earlier it's a heavily

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,700
multimodal system the assistants

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,950
themselves allow you to be able to

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,570
transition across the device as and when

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,509
you want to be able to do so and

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,460
continue the process of your discovery

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,050
volvo cars are now rolling off the

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,479
production line with Google assistant

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,520
already enabled inside of them

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,960
there are numerous speakers and

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,160
wearables that have actually got these

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,039
inside of them already

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,050
Bo's being the obvious one in addition

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,729
to that there are televisions LG have

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,600
actually got assistance natively built

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,120
into them as well

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,789
so over time we're going to see the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,620
consumers are going to expect to be able

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,660
to both conduct a conversation with

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,130
these devices and expect that the way

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,539
that they converse or the way that they

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,430
get their information presented back

00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,289
from those devices is going to be

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,930
different based upon what device it is

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,220
so examples of this are if you are

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,590
speaking to somebody or you're

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,570
interacting via a speaker the answers

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,099
that you give need to be shorter they

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,169
need to be something that can be held

00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:13,550
onto and understood by a user if you're

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,590
giving them options you only have to

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,599
give one or two otherwise the cognitive

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,160
load becomes too much and the consumer

00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,139
will only remember the last option that

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,490
we've given to them if it's on a screen

00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,470
device you can give them three or four

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,150
and allow them to scroll through it if

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,620
it's on a television then obviously you

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,780
can alter the video and things along

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,490
these lines and if it's in a car then

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,050
you need to take into account the fact

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,070
that the user is driving they're not

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,800
going to be able to pay as much

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,180
attention and also usually somebody

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,770
who's driving is looking for something

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,000
that's going to be near them so the

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,710
answers that you give from an assistant

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,810
perspective of a conversational design

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:50,570
aspect needs to be reflective of this so

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,039
not many of these will mean much to

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,590
yourselves over here in Singapore

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,139
however this is some of the clients that

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,770
we have built these actions for office

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,419
works is a very large I suppose the best

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,419
way to describe them would be stationery

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:07,280
and electronics business timox is a

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,620
bookseller came out bricks and mortar

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,930
retail target bricks and mortar retail

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,060
Suncorp financial services banking

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,759
double ami and real insurance of both

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,190
insurance companies laser sight is an

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,620
eye repair so the people that do surgery

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,050
to remove cataracts and so forth finder

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,729
is a comparison sight Woolmark is the

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,370
peak body for the wool growers of

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,509
Australia bizarrely enough they actually

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,099
were very excited about the process

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,960
building this because it enabled people

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,360
to be able to understand the process

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,880
that goes into textile design New South

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,920
Wales Rural Fire Service this one here

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,470
was designed around bush fires and the

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,150
to actually have plans in association

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,010
against them also for people to be able

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,450
to identify if fires were near them and

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:52,030
what the current status of them was and

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,030
jb high fires and electronics rita palin

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,170
so the gift finder what was the process

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,350
that we went through for actually

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,660
developing one of these firstly we sat

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,280
down with Kmart and said and the basic

00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,650
premise behind developing one of these

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,450
is is the task that the consumer or the

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,490
user is going to be able to perform via

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,920
this digital assistant something that

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,080
they can't do via another existing

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,090
method or something that if they can do

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,950
it via that existing method it's faster

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,310
to actually do it via this form of

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:26,150
interface so we went through the process

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,680
with them we were given a brief as with

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,380
all clients the brief started with

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,730
inspire into light I don't know where

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,200
this came from but I don't think I've

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,460
ever been inspired or delighted by

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,650
anything that I have to say from a

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,110
company so this is always an exciting

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,670
one for everyone involved experiment

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,490
with a new platform on behalf of it

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,070
engaged in proactive client inspire the

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,560
home environment build a recommendation

00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,810
engine provide general information talk

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,940
about local stores enable full searches

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,400
of the shopping feed allow for faceted

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,260
searching send transactional emails and

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,460
do something than a simple one task

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,870
action so obviously that's a lot we

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,270
basically said to them this is probably

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,130
a little bit too much but surprisingly

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,930
enough in the end we actually managed to

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:13,100
build almost all of those functions into

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:16,760
it now being a company that comes from

00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,520
design and UX obviously we have a very

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,620
strong and robust approach to the way

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,060
that what we call it voice user

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,890
experience in this instance here but

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,990
it's just a traditional user experience

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,660
and design process it goes through the

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,090
four days discover divert define design

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,890
and deliver and obviously this involves

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,350
sort of research so you have the brief

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,570
you have your researchers search history

00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,430
one of the best and fastest ways to be

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,500
able to develop a conversational

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,610
interface is to be able to go back and

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,190
look at search queries that are

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,690
performed upon a site both external is

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,330
somebody going through a google to find

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,580
the site and on-site because what you're

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,420
tend to discover here is what people are

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,190
after what

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,480
questions they are asking and once you

00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,310
can discover the questions that they are

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,930
asking then you can begin to look at

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,820
ways that you can answer those questions

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,380
which is what conversation is really all

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,670
about

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,440
then there's the summarization of the

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,649
methodology and the development of a

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,839
persona customer journeys interactive

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,180
looking at the API is developing a

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,360
prototype usability testing so that's

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,860
the more traditional approach it ended

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,180
up being something a little bit more

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,730
like this

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,339
we got the flourish data we investigated

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,600
the api's to see what we could expose we

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,500
workshopped where people were actually

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,769
looking for

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,730
we spoke to customers and staff

00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,620
obviously people who are on the ground

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,790
dealing with customers on a daily basis

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,709
and some of the best to be able to give

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,980
me this information and then we did the

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,510
persona development and brand voice for

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,949
this particular side of things it's

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,370
probably a very important aspect to

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:48,470
think of for most organizations except

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,269
for potentially a brand ambassador or a

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,250
voice artist or somebody who's been

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,769
hired to be a part of for example a

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,990
television commercial most times people

00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:58,880
have not got a voice of a company

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,230
however when building a digital

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,000
assistant especially one that's going to

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,699
be spoken to via a conversational

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,410
interface such as voice itself you're

00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,949
actually developing for the first time

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,170
what this company sounds like and the

00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,690
sound and tone of this is very important

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,570
for the first time as a consumer you are

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,459
actually then assigning this voice and

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,140
this person to this brand and that will

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,459
be in place then for at least a couple

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,459
of years it's hard to turn that around

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,769
once you've done it and people tend to

00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,529
develop and associate certain traits

00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,060
based upon voice people will infer age

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,920
they'll know gender

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,680
they'll in foreach occation they'll

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,970
infer social status there's a number of

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,709
different aspects that will come from

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,540
this so when you're developing the

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,370
persona side of things all of that needs

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,839
to be taken into account because that's

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,670
the way the consumers are now going to

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,550
perceive this company within that moment

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,089
Ford's then of course we moved over into

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,800
the development of lists of core intents

00:10:52,089 --> 00:11:00,019
prototypes review of intense and

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,120
building the logic so as I mentioned

00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,529
earlier going through and developing the

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,959
use cases has done in a workshop

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,100
environment so we had to understand what

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,230
customers were asking

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,750
our customer service teams were telling

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,490
people looking at SEO side and looking

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,020
at the tone of voice and the persona

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,550
that was actually going to be developed

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,660
for this when I mentioned earlier if

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,670
you're looking for things that can be

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,050
performed better or faster via this

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,970
medium as the best approach that we're

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,770
looking for it's also time and context

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,480
so once again as I mentioned if somebody

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,680
is in their car their context is going

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,270
to be different from somebody who is in

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,500
the home and it's different once again

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,880
from somebody who's looking on a mobile

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,700
device because we all know from their

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,470
GPS where they're located so when you're

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,690
looking at these things we need to say

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,850
okay can it be performed better in this

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,560
environment is it useful to the consumer

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,820
to be done in this environment and are

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,380
they going to be able to get enough

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,610
information in a snapshot that we can

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,800
give them for them to be able to

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,690
actually make decisions those are what

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,250
you have to actually look at so when we

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,650
eventually developed and design for this

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,810
one here a gift recommendation guide it

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,400
came out of the fact that on a website

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,260
the way that you search doesn't really

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,240
allow you to be able to search for a

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,930
goal-oriented outcome that isn't

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,050
predefined by categorization brand

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,730
attributes SKU etc and number of users

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,250
were coming in with the challenge of I

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,930
have a birthday party coming up it's a

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,470
five year old I have no children of my

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,480
own

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,250
they're my nephew what do I buy them I

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,380
have a birthday party coming up

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,030
something else I have a gift I had a

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,890
housewarming these are the kinds of

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,170
environments where they're non usual

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,450
buys and they're a buy that is not for

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,830
yourself and so as a result of this it's

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,750
a lot harder to be able to make an

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,640
informed decision as to what you want to

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,140
buy for another person but websites

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,910
inherently don't allow you to do this

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,980
you can't go into the search bar of a

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,810
website and say I need to buy a gift

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,640
there's a true way conversation that

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,560
needs to happen to be able to understand

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,540
what you're looking for much the same as

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,850
if you're going into a store to buy a

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,220
television you have into the store the

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,140
person comes up to you they say what's

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,460
the size of your room what do you

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,140
actually do with this television you're

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,390
a gamer do you like sport do you watch

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,370
movies do you stream a lot yes this room

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,050
got natural light how far away do you

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,460
sit from it this is the conversation

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,740
that's had been you buy a television in

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,600
store when you go onto a website it is

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,550
what size is the television

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,100
what's its definition and what's the

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,690
brand this is the only information that

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,800
it gives you so the development of

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,840
something that's going to allow for that

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,980
conversation is probably a very good use

00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,260
case when it comes to voice conversation

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,380
design conversation design for these

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,180
environments is not like a chatbot a

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,830
chat pod is a very linear process it

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,690
doesn't utilize natural language in the

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,060
same way this here is a full natural

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,190
language processing system so this means

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,700
that the conversation can either be as

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:46,010
simple as step by step or as convoluted

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,580
as and to give the example for a gift

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,820
finder

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,990
I need a gift for a five-year-old active

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,240
child for under $20 now there's three or

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,880
four entities inside of that you have

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,890
child you have age you have price you

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
have active and all of this needs to be

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,790
interpreted to be able to give an answer

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,170
a chatbot is incapable of doing that

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,630
because the chap what expects you to say

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,120
yes no button click what the next step

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,280
is going to be so the conversation

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,320
design really needs to be able to really

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,050
step somebody through the process or

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,030
understand all of those concurrent

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,500
pieces of information and give an answer

00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,170
that's going to be correct without

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,330
actually then saying who's this gift for

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,190
how old is this person it's already been

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:35,480
told don't make the mistake of avoiding

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:38,090
that step so I'm going to give a small

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,250
demonstration of what these actually

00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,680
look like how we've built them what they

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,190
actually perform like I don't know if

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,540
the sound is going to work if it doesn't

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:54,290
that's okay I can walk through it anyway

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:59,110
the other part of it is just bear with

00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:02,430
me a second here let's see if this works

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,920
then we're going to begin to go into the

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,360
actual utilization of location which is

00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:00,470
probably one of the most important parts

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:04,669
of this as well where is my closest

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:06,319
store to locate your closest store I'll

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:13,339
just need to get your current location

from Google is that okay yes as you can

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,870
see your clothes came and Broadway

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,850
anything else I can help with today

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,260
so now that we've said where the store

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,449
is located what time does it open

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,339
yesterday it will actually keep the

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,350
context of this store so from now on any

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,460
question mark Broadway is open from 8:00

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:33,380
a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday anything

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,740
else I can help with today will always

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,960
be about that store what time you open

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,210
this Tuesday

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,700
once again combination of terms to

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,860
locate your closest store I'll just need

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,720
to get your current location from Google

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,720
is that okay sure

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,610
Kmart Broadway is open from 8:00 a.m. to

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:05,179
11:59 p.m. on Tuesday remember the

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:09,140
context of being Tuesday I want printer

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:14,450
paper alright for that you might like

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:15,530
office works wanna give it a try so I'm

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,100
just going to pause on this one for a

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,780
second the fact is that unlike the other

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,210
assistants that are out there Google's

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:26,330
one is designed around discovery so

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,070
Alexa is designed around tasks these

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,990
tasks are either called out by a

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,030
consumer or it's going to be a retail

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,500
based environment but Google's one is

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,809
actually around people being able to

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,630
find things this here is called an

00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,490
implicit invocation you can build an

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,290
assistant to actually be indexed by

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,700
Google much the same as websites are

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,290
built to be indexed by Google from an

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,330
SEO perspective so that you can actually

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,250
get serviced and presented customers

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,809
that don't know who you are so the

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,429
majority of digital assistants that are

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,179
accessed through these are named by the

00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,639
brand

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,830
talk to Kmart talk to demux talk to Ober

00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,419
so on and so forth in this instance here

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,879
all the producer have said is I want

00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:03,229
printer paper and in return Google has

00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:05,269
said for that you might want to talk to

00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:07,399
office works so what we've actually

00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,259
begun to see by this is that through

00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,659
building this correctly and allowing for

00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:14,419
the interface to be in the same mode as

00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:16,609
the consumer is looking in ie we're not

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,009
trying to push a static website into a

00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:21,739
voice or a digital assistant environment

00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,809
Google is now recommending brands that

00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:26,779
have actually built products for it with

00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:28,940
the correct service built in so now in

00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,440
Australia anybody who's actually talking

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,919
to an assistant and just asked a printer

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,179
paper is being recommended one company

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,009
it's a very powerful thought when it

00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,869
goes around that which is exactly why

00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,609
when websites are first built SEO became

00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:48,979
such a big aspect to everything this is

00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:52,669
SEO for voice yes sure what size paper

00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:53,989
are you looking for for so now you've

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,580
been taken straight into the office

00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:56,929
works assistant the environment has

00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,159
changed you're no longer out citing

00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,200
Google you're now into a closed

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,609
environment and not only that it's

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,099
remembered the context that what you've

00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,719
come through on was printer paper so the

00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,729
first statement is not welcome to office

00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:09,109
works what can I help you with today the

00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:11,119
first statement is actually taking you

00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:12,440
straight into the flow of continuing

00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,619
with your journey of wanting printer

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,619
paper

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:25,140
okay I found J Burroughs 90 GSM pro a

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,320
for copy paper 500 she cream for five

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,080
dollars and 49 cents add to shopping

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,970
list now we can move over into the

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,100
transaction side of things this product

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,020
has been added to your shopping list you

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,940
have one item on your shopping list

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:45,810
would you like this email to you now all

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:48,180
can I help you with anything else so

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,800
what this shows as well is that there's

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,570
the ability to not just build these to

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,010
be able to service product there's the

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,060
ability to be able to then take this

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,130
through to the next stage which is

00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,780
transaction and completion which means

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,400
that you can develop an ROI around it

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,540
which is why it is that organizations

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,510
are beginning to look at investing

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:09,110
inside of these so what we learned these

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,960
things aren't simple to build

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:16,920
conversation is actually really complex

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:19,350
with the example of office works we were

00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,760
finding that people were asking for I

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,750
want I need tell me about and buy so I

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,880
want printer paper

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,790
I need printer paper tell me about

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,920
printer paper buy printer paper so all

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,480
of these are very different goals that

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,360
the user is after but they're a very

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,490
similar statement and the continuum word

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,780
in there is printer paper so because of

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,280
the fact that initially it was getting a

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,810
little bit confused with the fact that

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,460
which of the printer paper one it was

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,410
looking for so when we were training it

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,240
in the conversation side it was having a

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,010
little bit of a challenge we thought we

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,400
would get more prescriptive so we

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,810
thought instead of utilizing the full

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,540
machine learning side we'd put it on

00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,290
Rails so we would actually write I want

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,210
printer paper

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,280
tell me about printer paper I need

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,260
printer paper buy printer paper as

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,020
completely separate conversations with

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,890
different outcomes would be against it

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,020
the problem with that is when you're

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,180
looking at a database of a couple of

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,330
hundred thousand s KU's and you suddenly

00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:17,010
have four different aspects against

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,070
every single one of those and in the

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,930
category level the conversational

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,840
machine learning piece then begins to

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,730
put weight upon I need I want tell me

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,340
about and Buy It Now begins to see these

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,230
as entities not just as the product as

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,429
being what it wants so then what was

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,379
happening is when

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,690
somebody was saying I want printer paper

00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:38,639
it might be going away and saying I'm

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,259
gonna give you laptops because more

00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:42,539
people previously when they said I've

00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,100
want have searched for laptops so in my

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,600
waiting system that I'm giving into the

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,190
machine learning aspect of what I think

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,570
is the correct answer to give because

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,549
it's always just an informed guess with

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,139
these things since as they learn the

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,700
process to be able to get better

00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:55,529
it's an informed guess that they put

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,059
forwards and then if it work then they

00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:58,980
know they've done well if it didn't they

00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,809
try and fix it the next time around so

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,789
now I want is something that it's going

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,529
to go with just to fall to the most

00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:06,539
often one that people have gone for so

00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,769
now the most searched-for product

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,769
becomes the default answer for

00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:12,869
everything so we actually had to go back

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:14,850
strip all of that prescriptive aspect of

00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:16,379
it out and go back into conversational

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,850
training with it which meant that we

00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:19,619
actually had to have people sitting in a

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,970
room talking to these for a very long

00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,830
time so that it actually began to

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,080
understand and learn what it was almost

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,460
like with a child and that is the

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,820
process that you have to do with these

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,350
things

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,730
if you don't do the training of the

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,929
conversation correctly you just turn

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,669
them on and expect the machine learning

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:37,830
to do it for you it's going to fail

00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:39,570
don't write anything before you've built

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,940
and tested the triggers is exactly the

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,100
one that I'm talking about there also

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,600
you need to be able to look at how you

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,429
begin to find choose those as you're

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,279
going through you're going to fail

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,749
you're going to have intense that don't

00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,919
work you don't have conversations that

00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:53,970
don't seem to quite answer what they're

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,059
looking for you're going to have to

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,529
learn to pair things out cut them re--

00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,720
splice them and go back and find the

00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:02,909
conversation again these things can't

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,059
actually just be turned on and left they

00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:07,470
don't work like an app it can't be built

00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,610
downloaded to somebody's phone left for

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,340
six months and have a new version

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,169
released you need to actually go into it

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,309
and look at the conversations look at

00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:16,649
what it's doing look at what it's

00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:18,119
answering identify the fact that it's

00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,490
not answering what the consumer wants

00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,340
and then try and write an answer or try

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,409
and guide it into a better outcome the

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,149
other part of it is these things don't

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:32,669
have everything in them already you know

00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:33,629
Google assistance Amazon Alexa Bixby

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,700
Siri

00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:38,519
they've got upwards of ninety five

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,110
percent recognition and correct response

00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,970
when somebody talks to them but that's

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,529
because they have a complete list of

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,340
every single conversation that has ever

00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,810
happened to them

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,220
and as a result of this the database

00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,780
they're going back to is huge in the

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,850
training aspect of it it's gigantic

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,870
you don't get that instantly inside of

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,950
yours so it can't answer everything

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,540
you'll see people come in and do this

00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,070
you you can break one of these things

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,290
very simply you open it up and say I

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,300
want a banana and it won't answer

00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,190
because if database doesn't have a

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,690
banana and less it's a supermarket so at

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,580
that point there it goes into a loop

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,590
sorry I can't help you with that can you

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,330
try saying something else milk please I

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,940
can't help you with that chocolate and

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,110
then it drops out so what you need to do

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,270
when you're looking at this is you need

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,980
to then go are these conversations that

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,580
are being had with it that are making it

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,260
drop out useful so when we're actually

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,730
looking at that it needs to be okay this

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,020
person's come in and said jobs that

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,000
office works maybe we should put a

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,590
careers feed in there this person has

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,330
come in and said what's your returns

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,920
policy now we're putting a fake use in

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,150
so the conversations need to be

00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,740
something that's going to be a benefit

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:42,210
to the user now I'm going to go into

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,680
technical notes so I'm sure a lot of you

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,850
were going to get very excited about the

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,440
fact that we're now getting into

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,690
something which is technical I am NOT

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,720
technical so I'm going to go through

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,070
what we did the police don't expect me

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,840
to understand what we did we had a

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,760
development team that did that piece and

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,070
I originally was going to have my senior

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,260
developer here to present this one but

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,180
his son's birthday was on this weekend

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,590
and didn't want to leave Australia so my

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:10,110
apologies you have a mud so we

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,330
integrated with the retail database came

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,700
up provided us with the api's not all

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,920
the information was supposed to support

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,690
him for the custom solution so what we

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,580
were looking at doing was we would be

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,770
given all of the data and the data was

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,930
completely unstructured it was in the

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,720
way that they had it so SK used the

00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,530
items would be listed as brand

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,350
subcategory category

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,990
make model information about the product

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,050
itself imaged so on and so forth that

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,420
would reside in the product SKU listing

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,850
we would then have a database which

00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,700
would be locations moved then have a

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,470
separate database which was availability

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,970
in store and we heard another database

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,070
on the other side which would have store

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,450
opening hours and store information but

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,970
as we mentioned earlier a lot of these

00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,950
answers require three or four bits of

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,840
that information so we had to develop

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,660
middleware we

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,190
surprisingly enough we utilize Amazon's

00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,900
system even though we're running a

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,720
Google system on this one we don't use

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,090
cloud Google are aware of this and like

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,110
it but Amazon's one is more robust when

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,630
it comes down to what we can actually

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,850
pull out and use it for and this enabled

00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,560
us to be able to take into requirements

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,350
that we needed out of each of these

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,570
siloed databases and present them in one

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,040
coherent response so what we're actually

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,420
doing is pulling little bits of

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,370
information out of different locations

00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,770
to be able to give one centralized

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,600
answer so when somebody says I want

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,250
printer paper from my local store what

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,570
time does it close tomorrow we are

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,580
actually taking that out of five

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,980
different locations pulling it back

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,020
together answering and this all has to

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,520
happen inside of seven seconds because

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,590
if it takes any longer than seven

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,300
seconds Google says this is too slow to

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,820
respond then it cuts out so send it from

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,860
the speaker into dialogue flow which is

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,120
the tool that actually runs out the the

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,150
machine learning in the conversation

00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,040
into actions on Google which is the back

00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,420
end piece of that one out into the

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,920
middle where out from the middle where's

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,420
in the database you have to have the

00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,590
database respond and then it has to go

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,320
concurrently all the way back through

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,760
those again so it has to be very well

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,830
structured and built to be able to

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,330
ensure that all of that can be performed

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,860
from the multiple databases and still

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,490
come back inside of seven seconds with

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:21,180
the conversation

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:24,390
pretty impressive really the information

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,850
of location services so as I mentioned

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,020
local store data feed smart presentation

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,790
of the opening and closing hours

00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,010
availability of product at that

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,900
particular store and suggestion of a

00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,100
product in another one so this is where

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,960
we did a theory which we are now called

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,840
concentric recommendation so what this

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,390
means is if you ask the question is this

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,370
product available in my local store most

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,400
cases most systems will answer that

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,920
question but we considered that to be

00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,570
the wrong question to answer if somebody

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,060
is asked about a product and they've

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,490
said do you have this product yes I do

00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,870
is it available in my local store it's a

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,080
closed question if it's not in that

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,790
store all you say is no but instead what

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,560
we said was well if it's not available

00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,890
in this store how far away is the next

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,440
door

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,670
and can we actually say yes it's not

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,830
available in your near

00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,360
store but it is available in this one

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,800
which is five kilometers further away

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,570
would you like to know more information

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,950
about that and then allow the consumer

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,930
themselves to actually make a decision

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,610
and a determination if they would be

00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,900
prepared to go an extra three four five

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,830
minutes out of their way to be able to

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,420
actually get the product they were

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:33,000
looking for just find our logic we had

00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,010
to develop a flow which allowed people

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,710
to both be able to step through the

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,320
process and be able to skip or jump over

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,850
parts so as I mentioned earlier we don't

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,740
have to follow every step in the process

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,660
if the consumer has actually given us

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,850
pieces of the information all we

00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,620
actually have to ask for is the one

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,350
piece that's missing so by that what I

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,970
mean is I'm looking for a gift for my

00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,400
dad which means that I'm looking for a

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,200
gift it's a man and it's an adult so in

00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,810
that case all I need to ask is do you

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,910
have a budget and once again that's an

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,280
interesting one because we wrote all of

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,020
these budget questions then we launched

00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,000
it and on the first day they give to

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,040
find a broke over and over again and we

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,450
had no idea why then we went in and we

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,700
had a look and to see what it was doing

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:19,050
and when people were being asked do you

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,670
have a budget people were saying no we

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,740
of course built it to answer with a

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,690
number so we'd built it so somebody

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,830
would say ten fifteen twenty dollars and

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,330
it was going to know and it just

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,640
couldn't answer it because as far as its

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,230
concerned no it's not a number so once

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,180
again it's these little simple things

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,500
which to us as humans seem very

00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,840
reasonable at a conversational

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,300
perspective but to a computer is really

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,710
confusing and this is why you know to go

00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,420
with the long theme of a number of

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,280
people are saying AI and machine

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,230
learning in the near term is not going

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,790
to replace people because it's just too

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,650
hard for them to be able to take these

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,760
very basic things that we take for

00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,620
granted and understand them without

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,160
somebody explaining it to them and

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,880
they'll go into a loop otherwise you

00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,530
need to track everything we use three

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,550
different reporting tools to be able to

00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,290
actually make this work

00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,330
dialogue flow which allows us to be able

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,710
to see the conversation the the

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,140
transcripts of every single conversation

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,870
that has been had with the user chat

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,550
base which is a chat bot oriented

00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,190
reporting tool which allows us to see

00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:19,140
flow if something is succeeding and if

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,450
something is failing and then we utilize

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,790
GA so we put Google Analytics on the

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,290
background of it the reason we put GA on

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,270
this is twofold

00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,650
one is because of the fact that GA

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,810
allows us to be able to get session

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,310
information and it allows companies that

00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,650
have it to be able to roll this up

00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,820
across their entire network so they can

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,530
see returning users that have

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,720
transitioned from a website to a mobile

00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:42,240
into voice the other part of it is that

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,160
the conversational reporting won't show

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,820
what information is pulled from an API

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,380
so what it'll show is user came in they

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,240
said I want a gift and what's your

00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,600
budget fifteen dollars and then all you

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,060
will see is event an event at that point

00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,140
there is all that picks up so you're now

00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,790
going well I wonder what was presented

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,900
and so for a long time we couldn't

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,550
actually see what the product was we

00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,920
didn't know what was being presented so

00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:07,740
instead of that with GA we actually ping

00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,660
or pull the API report as it's coming

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,670
out and push it into GA as a custom

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,830
dimension so what this means is when the

00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,510
API is returning a product and pushing

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,130
that into the conversation we are

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,990
actually pulling that product putting it

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,940
into the session information so that we

00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,400
can go in and say this conversation

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,900
resulted in this product being

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,280
recommended even though we can't

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,280
actually see it in the conversation flow

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,990
so why did we do it that way well as I

00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,530
said smart ecosystem will do the heavy

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,930
lifting the link linking simple use

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,510
cases together and Google knows who

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,420
where when third parties know what and

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:48,150
what I mean by that is Google is

00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,270
actually really really bad at voice at

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,800
the moment in fact all of them are

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,660
Alexis bad at its Ceres bad at it and

00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,990
the reason is this they are trying to

00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:00,210
index the static web and the static web

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,580
was designed to trick search engines

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,860
into sending users to their website so

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,990
everything was built around you know top

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,400
ten things that do this because that's

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,840
what people search for and then Google

00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,370
would index that they'd appear at number

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,740
one it was really spammy it's a horrible

00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,420
experience so because of this when you

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,310
go into Google now or you go into any of

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,990
them and speak to them the response that

00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,550
they give you is horrible because it's a

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,920
static web being represented and

00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,900
rendered in an incorrect form and an

00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,750
example of that is this if I go to

00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,240
Google assistant and I say gifts for men

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,710
I'm not in a third party action I'm not

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,990
sure if you can read this the first

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:38,970
result is our space soap so you know

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,070
basically speaking Google is reckon

00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,660
that every single man who has been asked

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,360
about a gift should have asked face soap

00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,440
bought for them now I don't know about

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,850
you but I'm really not looking forward

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,040
to getting that brown and white bar of

00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,530
soap on my birthday

00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,390
so what Google wants much like Google

00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,220
wouldn't exist without websites to

00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,370
actually provide it with content Google

00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,980
wants businesses to build interfaces and

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,540
experiences that are better for the

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,760
actual environment that these users have

00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,950
decided to interface with so they wanted

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,510
companies to build voice and digital

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,250
assistants so that when a consumer comes

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,320
through and does this they're actually

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,680
able to get surged with a response in

00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,970
the mode that they have chosen now the

00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,240
other part of this is going to be the

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:23,040
long-term play and we have a very close

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,110
relationship with Google we've been a

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,610
Google marketing platform reseller for a

00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,980
number of years we're a Google premier

00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,980
partner we started out as an SEO agency

00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,280
in 99 so we've seen a lot of what it is

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,440
that Google does in their evolution

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,970
Google is going to want over time for

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,520
these experiences to be as much

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,500
first-party ie inside of the Google

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,240
ecosystem as it can possibly be not

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,590
transitioning out into third party which

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,720
is what we've built with these they're

00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,970
the Kmart action the office works action

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,830
there's a third party you you pass out

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,870
of being in the Google world into a

00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:58,770
closed Walt environment that is owned by

00:34:54,870 --> 00:35:00,120
the brand but what we see is Google is

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,740
going to want these assistants to

00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,620
perform tasks without the consumer

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,790
having to think about it and this is

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,650
where they are going to start to do

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,690
monetization because monetization for

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,610
them will not be advertising it'll be

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,920
fulfillment of the action on behalf of

00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:16,920
the consumer with one step so what I

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,030
mean here is the example I'm heading to

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,320
San Francisco this is actually a

00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,000
conference that I went to for business

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,810
of bots earlier on in the year that I

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,450
spoke at and in this environment here

00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,730
over time you self-select or you link to

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,200
brands and you tell Google these are the

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,430
brands that I use and they have an

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,430
action that enables you to perform a

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,290
task so think about it Qantas is the

00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,810
airline that I almost always fly with so

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:42,510
if I link my action to Qantas as digital

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,040
assistant that's my airline kills and

00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,650
honors I tend to stay at a Hilton Hotel

00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,120
I tend to use uber so here's three

00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,370
pieces of information that take place

00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,530
here we can see in the future where you

00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,290
just say ok Google book mate

00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,910
to San Francisco it's got my calendar

00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,890
it's got my email address it's got my

00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,300
itinerary and whilst I'm there I say I

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,190
want to catch up with such-and-such and

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,900
have dinner so at that point they're

00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,850
Google goes and books my flight because

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,620
it knows when I have to be there Google

00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,600
actually transferred me to and from the

00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,460
airport utilizing uber who can book me

00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,780
into the hotel Google knows who the

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,550
person that I'm meeting with is because

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,260
they have my contacts they have my diary

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,970
they know where I'm located they know

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,080
where the conference is located so at

00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,670
this point here they're able to actually

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,990
then send an email to that person with a

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,670
meeting invite saying do you want to do

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,590
this this night there's probably only

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,540
two or three steps in here that it can't

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,040
complete and that's the restaurant it

00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,450
might know the kinds of food that I buy

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,820
so it could come back with two or three

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,920
recommendations or it could actually

00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,630
just sell me to that restaurant those

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,950
three restaurants offered to buy me is

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,560
sitting at a table at that moment in

00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,420
time and that moment Google says well

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,590
they like Chinese there's three Chinese

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,420
restaurants we put them out of those

00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,340
three one of them offers $10 one offers

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,990
50 and the other one offers 18 Google

00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,270
goes you're going to the once $18 now

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,070
the restaurants booked and then addition

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,910
to this that then says hey while you're

00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,880
there do you want to go mountain bike

00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,860
riding so it now begins to introduce

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,360
something else into the process that's

00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,370
the way that we can see these digital

00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,330
assistants transitioning over the course

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,240
of the next couple of years

00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,950
so when people talk about you know 50%

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,190
of all search is going to be performed

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,860
by voice and these kinds of stats that's

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,360
interesting but not exciting the fact

00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,890
that a lot of these companies and that's

00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,840
why it is that all of these big players

00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,120
are heavily investing into these digital

00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,800
assistants now is because this is where

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,110
they're going to be going with it they

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,970
want to be able to own large aspects of

00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,350
everyone's lives and almost be able to

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:33,300
complete where they're going to go with

00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:35,160
it so the last part that I would like to

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,480
say is if you're going to be going down

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,830
this path that it's something that

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,660
you're going to be exploring either for

00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:43,290
yourselves or for businesses that you

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:46,830
work with or in the typical one of make

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:49,530
a plan but assume it'll change trust me

00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,090
it will but don't do it unless you've

00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,610
actually spoken to customers or people

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,380
who deal with consumers on a regular

00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,240
basis or your customers because that's

00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,680
the conversation otherwise what you're

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,690
going to do is you're going to write

00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,280
something the way that you think it

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,300
should go and then customers are going

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,960
to come in and have a completely

00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,780
different viewpoint of it

00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,460
have a big idea we explore them but

00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,680
don't try and put everything into them

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,320
at once like I said earlier these things

00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,480
get confounded they get confused for

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,550
insurance brands we are actually

00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,740
building a different action for each

00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,210
insurance type because the word

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,800
insurance will confuse it so home

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,940
insurance life insurance so on and so

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,880
forth will be in a different one each

00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,040
time insure that you track everything

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,870
insure that you go in and actually check

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,850
things report against them see what's

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:38,150
not working and try and tailor it and

00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:42,380
try and train it again and speak to

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:45,350
Google or Amazon or on this note here

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,840
Apple three weeks ago now just purchased

00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,820
a company called pull string pull string

00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,460
was founded by an ex disney/pixar writer

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,810
he's a conversational designer and his

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,600
technology enabled you to be able to

00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:59,000
create conversations Apple didn't have a

00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,980
third party set up for Siri previously

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,390
we believe the purchase of pull string

00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,220
will mean that Apple will now open up

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,050
Siri to third-party developers inside of

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,800
the next six months which will be a big

00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:11,150
step so look at the network that you

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,290
want look at the reach that you want

00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,970
look at the partner that you want to

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,220
work with determine which one's going to

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,140
be the best one talk proactively to them

00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,730
and then make sure that you go into this

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,440
knowing that this is something that's

00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,690
going to be at least a one-year project

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,090
from start to the point where it's going

00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,380
to be sort of okay to work with and then

00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,380
