This session is dedicated to answering the important questions companies need to ask before deciding to build a Voice Assistant and then talking through the journey to deliver one to market.

The most important questions to ask before you start are:

·       Do you even need a Voice Assistant

·       Which Platform should you build yours on (Alexa, Google, Apple etc)

·       What is the company Objective

·       What Problem are you trying to solve for your customers

Once the above have been answered a plan needs to be developed for building and measurement of the Assistant:

·       Which internal Stakeholders need to be involved (IT, Marketing, Customer Service etc)

·       What is the Call to Action (CTA)

·       Do you have a defined Brand Persona/Voice and how do you bring this to the Assistant

·       What APIs are available and, if you don’t have any, can you use Live Data

·       What does Success look like for this Assistant

·       How will you Measure performance

·       Who will own the Assistant post launch

Lastly we will then walk through the Conversational Development Process to show:

·       How to write conversations for Assistants

·       What a Context is and how to use them to anchor conversations to customer Goals

·       Examples of Voice Intents and how to craft customer journeys in a Voice environment

·       When Screen devices can be used and how to build Rich Cards to complement Voice interactions

·       Other functions in Assistants such as Transactions, Email Sending, Video Casting, Map Directions, Pre Ordering (Voice to Collect) and other Actions

Attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of the Voice ecosystem, how it can be applied to their business as well as the building blocks to go back to their own company and start a discussion about where Voice may fit into their company plans plus how to start developing an Assistant
