Vast and fast growing ecosystem of opensource components enable developers choose appropriate components. Along with the vast choice of opensource components, developers need guidance to choose secure, license compliant and appropriate dependencies that match the "intent" of the application(s) being built.

Powered by Machine Learning algorithms, Dependency analytics platform  ingests vast number of opensource components and right inside your VSCode editor, provides complete health check for all the opensource components (Security, License compliance and flag any usage outliers) along with specific guidance to choose appropriate opensource components matching the intent of the application being built.

The platform performs in depth analysis of application dependencies and provides developer with a report which has below features and are the major topics for our talk:

1. Suggests a project level license, check for conflicts between dependency licences.

2. Flags a security vulnerability (CVE) and suggests a remedial version.

3. Shows GitHub popularity metrics of dependencies along with latest version.

4. Recommends dependencies based on the current set of dependencies used, using machine learning techniques.
