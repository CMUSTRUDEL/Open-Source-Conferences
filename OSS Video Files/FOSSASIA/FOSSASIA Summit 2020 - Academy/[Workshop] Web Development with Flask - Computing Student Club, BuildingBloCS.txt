you have access to Wi-Fi

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,040
so welcome to web development in France

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,740
workshop today we'll be learning how to

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,100
create a simple application using button

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,899
or more specifically applause so before

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,030
we get started you can exist

00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:27,090
which are parts of them might have and

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,810
if you wanna get a slide

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,810
is that you

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,950
jean-francois some of them might not

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,950
that come everything's

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,409
and you

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,409
kvl my

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Pikul

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,790
all of those points

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,849
also my

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,050
slightly be what everybody but most of

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:42,100
it will be hands on soul

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,100
the slice Mohini

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,870
most of a will be hands-on first you may

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,840
have a war program learn how to handle

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,540
the Atari simple forms displaying such

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,240
equal statement time we learn how to

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:21,190
post it online through button anywhere

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,190
and hopefully

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,710
so twice plus plus is a web framework it

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,389
provides you with tools like we send

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,720
technologies they allow you to build a

00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,699
web application what's the difference

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,919
between web applications and web sites

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:42,770
well applications are interactive for

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,530
web sites are static what every patients

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,690
can take users input and dynamically

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,880
change the web pages is a two-way

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,960
interaction with it I sent for viewer to

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,199
server and so what we were it's a simple

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,199
work

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,110
also said we give Ellen

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,170
you felt all right

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,450
requested it on two different methods

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:30,100
either get more books which I will cover

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:33,250
more vintage so now that we know what

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,880
Plus web applications are let's get

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,910
started

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,480
here are some requirements before we

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:44,070
start our do you guys have already

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,080
installed your laptop

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,080
haha he's just real quick

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:57,560
I wind up using Visual Studio code woman

00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,130
in fact are not bad class pass but if we

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,130
can't get it

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,650
this idea yet

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,060
maybe

00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:02,549
depending on what version it is

00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,240
between recording isn't it

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,990
on your desktop you can create a

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,620
and inside his for the

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:53,270
we start off with a simple hello world

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:56,680
vacation to get familiar with HTML and

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,680
little CSS

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:11,779
inside the flask folder you can create a

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:14,360
hello world inside a folder

00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:16,290
installed me about my

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,890
and so be y'all

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,890
drive a Volvo

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,430
to get started

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,420
the following function

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,180
crossing both capitalized us

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,900
request

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,370
so that you're gonna create the

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,370
application

00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,039
and people to floss

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,130
you can name it anything you can even

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:27,770
bend on my application but

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:31,190
it's simple simply because you wanna

00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:33,730
gonna disturb me Father

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,730
Krishna

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,550
so what these lights does is basically

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,150
tells the

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,250
says that this is

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:45,179
disappear

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,179
definition fall

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,730
next thing you wanna do is

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,770
I get to search for this round at the

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:59,160
end of

00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,850
which is disability for Nassau video

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,850
homepage

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,840
things

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:10,840
finds it you write this function index

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,840
returns

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,920
to run this application to change if

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,560
it's not

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,700
I think

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,890
maybe get to y'all

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,890
a mobile folder

00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:58,379
once you decide you want to run the pie

00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:58,379
apple pie also quite

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,540
you should stop

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,540
web application in locals

00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,770
because s s anyway

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,900
and after day who might want to study

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,900
all

00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:36,309
so moving on our foreign assistance

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,200
upholstery

00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:41,230
so it's taught it can't really do much

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,809
so why you wanna do is most of the time

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:48,040
you wanna you wanna wear a vacation to

00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:51,900
return html5 and to do that you change

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,900
the written hello work to be done

00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,870
in HTML file which we are creating so

00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,870
less fully indexed

00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:28,530
so what's your rather day can say our

00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:31,980
hello world we also need a mother folder

00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:34,950
for you to start HTML files so we have

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:38,340
to limit templates because that's the

00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:41,609
default if you wanna change your this

00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,220
folder it's not HTML you can

00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:46,659
specifying the last one for simplicity

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,239
sake

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,649
I'll make sure is templates with an

00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,649
Isetta back or else even on

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:07,500
inside the templates for the create HTML

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,500
all HT indexed on each table

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,920
can start 15 how HTML

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
things

00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,530
this is a HTML file

00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,750
samo

00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,609
in sales

00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:12,609
with all will cotton

00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:15,269
customize the HTML page so that you can

00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:15,269
bustle

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,660
so you have a wall

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,870
so once you've created HTML file you can

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,950
restart

00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:57,119
Mission Control co-terminal

00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,119
and just rerun it

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,680
that

00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:51,890
so right now our web application does is

00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:54,710
gives you the HTML why done do is pass

00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:58,840
on some variables to this HTML so they

00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,840
can change depending on users input

00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,900
let's see Rihanna itself just have a

00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:08,460
wall when I said welcome the users or

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,460
hello Sydney

00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:17,140
so poor software placeholder well now

00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:20,489
with a double curly bracket and the name

00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,489
of a variable inside

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,480
- pasta available to this HTML file

00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:59,640
and roll

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,240
swish

00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,240
you'll get

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,099
because

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,700
what request also get basically things

00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:22,010
such as the URL for this argument new

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,569
and

00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:27,269
you get whatever name

00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:30,359
where I was

00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:35,519
you get a value in the URL sleeve the

00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:38,539
URL is named equal to Alex you get Alex

00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,539
inside this neighbor

00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,950
and once you happy inside your amplifier

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,950
you have to pass

00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,950
into HTML

00:43:54,289 --> 00:44:00,469
so the first name is what's inside our

00:43:56,929 --> 00:44:02,560
HTML if inside HTML it's helping people

00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:04,890
yes

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,970
hi for example

00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,970
you can set this one

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,290
say we start

00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:28,329
but you fault there's nothing in your

00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:28,329
URL so then

00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:36,560
by middle slash

00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,560
question mark people

00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,450
you can change your name

00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,650
one more thing

00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:12,500
in case the city's but you saw us not

00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:16,690
this nothing to name so just

00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,690
displacement we can sell before

00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,099
so we just added an appeal from Krishna

00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:28,369
locks again see there's no argument in

00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:28,369
him you just give

00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,090
wanna be like a piece

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,590
myself

00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:11,559
at CSS where it basically makes it

00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:14,140
myself but you can set box or make the

00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:16,390
buttons nice change their colors a lot

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,930
of things but we won't dive into details

00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:23,700
for that you can you can search online

00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:28,230
and find a lot of things about

00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:31,160
so inside I have a wall you wanna model

00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,160
for the homestanding

00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,209
inside static you wanna stalls

00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,660
for you to spoil you all the CSS phones

00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,260
knowledge

00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:59,239
but step across my school is for storing

00:49:54,379 --> 00:49:59,239
JavaScript CSS

00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:06,000
you can always specifies what folder

00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,520
these things will be inside if you have

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,030
no mind

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,030
philosophically use

00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,520
yes

00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:21,130
now we wanna you CSS you know web

00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:24,360
application so it's a hello world

00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:29,280
you know folder called static that is

00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:31,900
for you to store your JavaScript and CSS

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,990
so it's a setting you want to create a

00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,530
stars folder for you to put your own CSS

00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,530
fonts

00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,580
huh

00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,040
so what

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:07,030
all the CSS mom

00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:10,550
you can rename it what I'm following

00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:14,270
since we only what CSS song just name it

00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:18,370
stone if you have different files for

00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:18,370
different pages then

00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:27,150
it's like lost all those CSS let's say

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:27,150
you wanna make your own color

00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:40,180
anything

00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:42,550
you want everything inside your body

00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,160
package they're known to be allied to

00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:47,120
the center

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,120
thanks Eliza

00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:57,339
then also change of one of your own

00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,770
so for each one you are

00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:08,560
so once you have paid your CSS file you

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,720
want your HTML to link to the CSS form

00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,720
so inside it

00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,290
and it was also them

00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:34,390
if all that is working you can study all

00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,390
like that

00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,710
you should

00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:46,089
you know think should be like this and

00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,089
then you all make out college

00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,830
ideals therefore just all

00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,700
the operation

00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:21,310
five thousand

00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,870
and specify which 41 in

00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:36,110
suppose what people

00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,110
Oh

00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,460
but lady Felice

00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,570
so

00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:59,220
right now you should be soft familiar

00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,619
with our plus links to HTML so now

00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:06,750
you'll move on to creating a form and

00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:10,039
then receiving this beta form so here a

00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,039
separate folder for have a

00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:14,070
same things still in selfless work

00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:33,840
so inside registration for the same

00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,840
thing you wanna

00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,930
it's all that simple just now

00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,300
many days fall

00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,719
the HTML

00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:05,870
we see the same ps4 Medina's now is a

00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:09,170
for the lesbian

00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:11,440
it's a registration create templates

00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,440
photo

00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:26,020
it's

00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,560
I didn't lose

00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:40,730
- that me thanks

00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,730
you can express this city

00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:46,239
remember

00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:52,520
Mississippi you can set it down you can

00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,520
also set a steppin

00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:04,280
but in Folsom

00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:04,280
so you can start rethinking all form

01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:40,099
positions

01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,940
you want a pitiful

01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:57,140
their form you are not

01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:59,400
I detect a specific text box for you -

01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:02,670
and tell me

01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,299
the memo is footballs

01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:05,299
oh yes

01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,930
we're also well- dropped on is select

01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,930
all costs

01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:22,150
what is

01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,150
Nasus

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,820
when it blows the phone this will be

01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:29,100
done before select the one but

01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,730
one user

01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:35,100
submitter for me yeah process cross so

01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:38,640
we disable it so I think click on the

01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:40,740
drop-down selecting

01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,030
we can also like plaza they will have to

01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:47,030
choose ABC ot

01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:49,060
must be in a forum we also our submit

01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,060
button

01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:01,150
which is what's inside your submit

01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,150
button

01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,020
register

01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:51,859
so you have the phone now over you are

01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:54,740
at you is when the user submits this

01:04:51,859 --> 01:04:58,210
form you have to you need say let's send

01:04:54,740 --> 01:05:01,210
it back to your web server so form

01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,210
picture

01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:14,440
this time use the Force member

01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:14,440
they'll get

01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:48,130
we're suing I submit is form

01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:53,520
go to this slash register so next thing

01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:53,520
we do is free another round

01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:02,680
and we also that methods

01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:10,619
but default methods will be set again

01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,839
that's why early on we didn't have to

01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:15,869
explicitly say that methods we go

01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:18,589
together but since we are using posts

01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:18,589
now we have

01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:09,589
so when the foreman said to this smash

01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:09,589
range that we want to get the values

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:19,279
we want to get a very useful

01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:19,279
that name + ID

01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,500
yes

01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,740
early on we did request an obstacle but

01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,770
that's true

01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:36,320
again matter because we are receiving

01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:39,620
the attack should have post method

01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:42,340
use requests on phone organic state and

01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,340
me mother

01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:11,729
No

01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:23,430
there's two ways to send information

01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,430
from

01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:31,739
is scattered most so we get your request

01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:35,270
on our stocking and with force

01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:35,270
request or for market

01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:42,790
not necessarily car fonts you can also

01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:49,060
use to get by

01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:51,730
like slowly up before get method I do we

01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:54,850
explain your URL so you displayed your

01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:59,850
browser history other people can easily

01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:59,850
see but us is not so

01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:06,620
people commonly see

01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:12,400
so next you want to ensure that the user

01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:12,400
did give me a class idea not just a MP

01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:41,069
if they did give the name and class ID

01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:41,069
one

01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,780
success stories camera

01:09:56,749 --> 01:10:04,889
because this is a function if it reaches

01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:07,820
a return rate you would just stop it one

01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:07,820
you can do else

01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,940
but

01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:20,190
no ghosts

01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,250
doesn't trigger is you just skip this

01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:22,250
part

01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:48,210
Oh

01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:05,410
so follow

01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:09,570
you said well you've got a chi Edna

01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:09,570
by it so

01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,699
so they'll have to

01:11:13,179 --> 01:11:21,520
or you can also make use of javis room

01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:21,520
Bob all of it but

01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:37,960
there's a folder inside our workshop

01:11:34,309 --> 01:11:37,960
there's the geometry button

01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:51,570
so I have to create a feel success story

01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,570
tml

01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,950
success

01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:29,790
this way

01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:56,449
for my Jesus

01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:05,190
you

01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,580
you

01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:49,290
I wouldn't even show cultureless or in

01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:52,590
your daytime CSP it's unreal one body

01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:56,330
I'll explain why they expel us how much

01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:59,460
time we just keep it right so right now

01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:02,880
you just change this name and class ID

01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:05,370
and it really a success like you realize

01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:09,750
that the data is not actually going

01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:20,640
anywhere so one way to do is create an

01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:22,980
RV whenever form is something that you

01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:24,600
just have been to disarray but the

01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,980
problem with that is when you restart

01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,260
the application

01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:31,470
you know we run the whole thing and we

01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:34,730
initialize students as a theory so

01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:38,280
basically you are lose all your data so

01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:44,940
to actually spoil data you can use

01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:48,620
databases or CSV CSV this is secured by

01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:54,810
a simpler and less time-consuming so

01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:59,060
you're going to that you want to also

01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:59,060
import CSV

01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:19,939
from France in class peace is important

01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:22,639
CSV means it you just import the whole

01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:26,229
thing so you have access to everything

01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:32,659
but when you call when you use it you

01:27:26,229 --> 01:27:35,419
say CSV gone save it in sorry Peter if

01:27:32,659 --> 01:27:39,559
you wake up by this slide you just do

01:27:35,419 --> 01:27:42,489
one plus you can also do the same thing

01:27:39,559 --> 01:27:46,780
but this time that will be plus plus

01:27:42,489 --> 01:27:46,780
plus this plus

01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:37,710
so just import this what I mean we need

01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:47,460
the first line in fast they might be

01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:51,150
modules for connecting I'm not really

01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:59,250
sure I don't think so because what we

01:28:51,150 --> 01:29:00,360
learn is sp liar okay CSVs and whenever

01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:04,430
form is submitted

01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,430
you want to write to the CSV

01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:52,329
it is a very well it's the way if it's

01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:56,530
not exactly on the folder you know but

01:29:52,329 --> 01:30:00,040
that doesn't mean single also you can

01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:02,610
even write some other languages one

01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,610
character

01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:13,280
when you do we want to pass it on itself

01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:22,220
with a name come up a sign inside I'm

01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:34,170
sorry but this should be after you have

01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:38,640
checked then you safe give it a name and

01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:40,920
precise so put it under the hospital

01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:42,720
what's your on the first checking the

01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:59,490
user give an email plus I eat before

01:31:42,720 --> 01:32:02,880
writing it we use a tactic already

01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:05,360
treated yes we will just recreate the

01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,360
side

01:32:13,219 --> 01:32:22,820
why you looking yes

01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:29,000
besides just storing the data also on

01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:48,110
its few quests registered so to do that

01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:50,780
we'll create another this time you are

01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:53,480
read from the phone so you can also do

01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:56,120
the same thing follicle open itself a

01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:59,000
pen we were just used up but it's

01:33:56,120 --> 01:34:02,620
another way that doesn't require you to

01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,620
post a file with that

01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:31,620
so what this does is people open their

01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:36,690
registrants on CSV be whatever's inside

01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:39,450
and turn it into a list its colonies

01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:42,090
than students then will pass these

01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:44,570
students into the registrants HTML which

01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:44,570
will create

01:37:01,889 --> 01:37:17,260
find with Oakland and whatever you put

01:37:08,139 --> 01:37:21,610
is seeking to file right into identify

01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:24,999
us it is the virus to Daisy

01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:27,249
you can actually me me cause I realized

01:37:24,999 --> 01:37:30,869
something he mean name is registrants

01:37:27,249 --> 01:37:35,139
your pleasure this function so I just

01:37:30,869 --> 01:37:41,229
named students you're done whatever is

01:37:35,139 --> 01:37:42,099
inside a CSV into a nice yes and then

01:37:41,229 --> 01:37:44,349
the passes

01:37:42,099 --> 01:38:05,010
- that's variable into this registrants

01:37:44,349 --> 01:38:05,010
HTML because young so no matter what

01:38:17,719 --> 01:38:28,460
I see ah the CSV let's say you me me a

01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:30,590
students dots yes us there to do this so

01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:41,719
how we want to make the registrants to

01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:44,690
HTML so inside a template before we

01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:48,260
start I think that you might realize

01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:52,190
that it's all repeated every time you

01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:56,030
create HTML which require this doctype

01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:58,520
HTML I shall hear what you so we can

01:38:56,030 --> 01:39:02,180
actually just do that once in a layout

01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:06,170
of HTML and link all the other issue of

01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:08,380
edges to the food Israel table using

01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:14,540
this templating engine called teacher

01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:18,850
it's also power flux so inside me on

01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:22,930
HTML no one know what is usually written

01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:22,930
inside our HTML

01:39:33,739 --> 01:39:41,670
you may use on ginger to create a long

01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:46,699
before with with the stuff inside other

01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:46,699
HTML we just put it inside

01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:04,690
so it's Connie briefs person

01:40:47,010 --> 01:41:07,650
something just see them for the body you

01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:07,650
can actually call this another tip is

01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:15,510
you can have multiple of this or

01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:18,580
different yeah you can have multiple so

01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:22,350
it's another blonde I let's see the

01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:22,350
hidden or somewhere else

01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:29,430
now that we have this inside other HTML

01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:52,690
files itself having all this we either

01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:59,430
have we face percent expense whatever

01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:59,430
you want to be to the neon HTML

01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:16,290
so what I was inside here

01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:23,040
we brought inside this one annual

01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:23,040
weather is holy technology oh just

01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:53,030
come on the falsi H inside the workshop

01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:56,650
for everything I'm explaining now it's

01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:56,650
inside you might be slightly different

01:43:16,420 --> 01:44:03,079
but earlier you had this thing so

01:43:19,940 --> 01:44:06,980
ideally it's just wise shows on this

01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:09,469
part of your time so if you want

01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:15,020
different pages show different title you

01:44:09,469 --> 01:44:17,210
can ngn another one for C Python and

01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:21,170
inside of either the HTML you can have

01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:22,190
another section similar body came

01:44:21,170 --> 01:45:05,300
through long

01:44:22,190 --> 01:45:07,900
body change of title air inside yo al so

01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,900
having this

01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:36,559
but doing is also it is long HUP there's

01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:40,059
nothing here you just skip this one so

01:45:36,559 --> 01:45:40,059
we just hit we don't

01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:24,630
so all the stock registrants same thing

01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:24,630
you can just expand

01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:56,210
anyway water unordered list of all the

01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:59,880
students of the registrants

01:46:56,210 --> 01:47:02,429
which stands for Model T's we also made

01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:08,670
oddities oh well they were just not very

01:47:02,429 --> 01:47:11,280
one to reach me so early on in my pie we

01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:16,369
assign students to this traditions

01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:20,420
general so to display all the students

01:47:16,369 --> 01:47:20,420
again use ginger

01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:12,110
yeah you can check for language they do

01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:16,469
a lot similar to bite that counting my

01:48:12,110 --> 01:48:24,480
computations inside your HTML using Kim

01:48:16,469 --> 01:48:28,739
Jong so this PC check our things every

01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:32,489
student and create this item on student

01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:36,679
0 which is the name for buy from

01:48:32,489 --> 01:48:36,679
student 1 which is the class I think

01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:40,360
we completed this each element in the

01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:42,580
list will have a class ID is so fast

01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:47,800
today students you are taking on each

01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:50,800
element in students this one access to 0

01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:54,790
which is the first one which is a name

01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:57,010
and one which is the cosine so

01:49:54,790 --> 01:50:06,670
alternatively you only one the first

01:49:57,010 --> 01:50:09,250
student you can leave students so this

01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:12,640
will access the first student students

01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:23,220
and access the name of it because you

01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:23,220
wanna display everything everything

01:50:49,800 --> 01:51:16,170
you will see that as so these clean

01:50:52,510 --> 01:51:20,039
registrants OCSP inside separated venues

01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:20,039
so my xbox

01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:38,730
you can still complete without CSV

01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:17,630
chichi and everything is possible but I

01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:21,100
thought I think in databases there you

01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:21,100
just need to important ask you like

01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:34,490
another workshop or high school I think

01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:43,240
100 you can use it to do so to do a bit

01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:43,240
second workshop fast so that uses SQLite

01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:03,010
I'm pretty sure you can

01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:20,460
if you wanna make it easier for a user

01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:30,660
to navigate inside success you are now

01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:36,320
you mean link 202 the registrants this

01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:42,500
piece increased suddenly brings you to

01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:42,500
register / registrants

02:01:05,889 --> 02:01:08,889
hi

02:01:18,739 --> 02:01:28,159
be possible honest people checks whether

02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:28,159
is a Python

02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:42,160
is the mean for them start our web

02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:47,560
application so in email projects there

02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:50,820
might be multiple by 10,000 so if you

02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:57,780
run that you go on into scuttle

02:01:50,820 --> 02:02:03,330
something else so there is finally

02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:18,010
respect I still think we should send me

02:02:03,330 --> 02:02:20,680
before I change one absolutely it

02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:23,340
doesn't have to be me empty we can be

02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:23,340
anything

02:02:42,199 --> 02:03:09,989
five thousand yeah it is a tiny web

02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:13,440
server so in other words when you open a

02:03:09,989 --> 02:03:18,679
browser to find out which is a static

02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:22,980
file it won't run it links to the yeah

02:03:18,679 --> 02:03:31,530
you're running a small website so you

02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:33,770
press command-c in publishing this for

02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:49,850
the world

02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:55,760
it means that when I close my post event

02:03:49,850 --> 02:04:00,510
called services they can help you poster

02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:05,340
where vacation is Amazon Web Services

02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:07,520
little virtual by the anyway that's what

02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:21,350
you learn in school

02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:24,670
there's a straight boy and I think so

02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:24,670
what is just

02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:37,689
[Music]

02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:23,689
[Music]

02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:43,210
if commented to have your chemistry

02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:48,179
inside HTML is she better to put inside

02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:52,080
us are your static and scripts and

02:05:48,179 --> 02:05:57,270
JavaScript files but it is just like

02:05:52,080 --> 02:06:07,260
Shawn yeah it's just doing one thing

02:05:57,270 --> 02:06:11,500
just plain HTML what discussed is when

02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:16,060
user submits the form your carry-on is

02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:21,460
function if not you put not value

02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:24,489
meaning that if this people is happy but

02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:28,030
that's not bad you know about it you

02:06:24,489 --> 02:06:44,050
must provide me and you do the same

02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:48,280
thing for the neck so you get more

02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:52,080
people then you can use in and select by

02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:52,080
I I do

02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:07,440
so we believe in what you put packets

02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:19,560
getting the ID sign

02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:32,860
she's not very used to JavaScript I

02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:36,370
start expanding the process of all

02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:39,190
stepping paper for me

02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:42,330
ingenious money at the place so what is

02:07:39,190 --> 02:08:00,330
funny the cosine maybe you could even

02:07:42,330 --> 02:08:03,850
triggered a so this is done by a

02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:07,690
prompt icon which I am watching on

02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:10,600
technology that s the issue of falseness

02:08:07,690 --> 02:08:15,900
as far as in a good you are pick from

02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:15,900
their head send it for show the user

02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:47,670
but issue this is most web browsers you

02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:51,510
can actually disable JavaScript so it's

02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:57,630
time to wait for for validation so also

02:08:51,510 --> 02:09:09,810
the time in your app don't I have I if

02:08:57,630 --> 02:09:12,660
not just is it simpler for the user so

02:09:09,810 --> 02:09:16,530
you won't get redirected net page and I

02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:19,110
may have to go back to the Java stream

02:09:16,530 --> 02:09:22,860
is also faster because he's from other

02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:25,380
users slept on so the data doesn't AG

02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:29,300
get central or civil servant process it

02:09:25,380 --> 02:09:29,300
it's anything just

02:09:41,829 --> 02:09:51,610
so moving on from forms go to display

02:09:47,920 --> 02:10:00,489
and searching off so this one you

02:09:51,610 --> 02:10:03,270
actually need a workshop inside inside

02:10:00,489 --> 02:10:12,760
the workshop class this is what's folder

02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:17,340
inside was this is much fun so for that

02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:17,340
we're doing with words as well

02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:30,630
is lunch following movements so what

02:10:26,969 --> 02:10:34,260
like Jesus is a very very very long

02:10:30,630 --> 02:10:38,370
thanks on what's this object $40 what's

02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:41,489
them so long gonna do it so such from

02:10:38,370 --> 02:10:46,590
this much power and only display said

02:10:41,489 --> 02:10:48,860
that once that started so it's a always

02:10:46,590 --> 02:10:48,860
fun

02:11:50,350 --> 02:11:59,210
so simply as before twelve o'clock in

02:11:55,430 --> 02:12:11,120
the web and sexually strong generator

02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:13,970
and with a deep exhalation post

02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:41,570
disability using one or two new HTML 4

02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:43,790
sound music we need to put HTML in one

02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:46,840
folder it doesn't have to be templates

02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:49,280
but if by default flash sexiness

02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:51,440
definite so when you run a fashion

02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:55,070
better definitely will automatically

02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:59,180
search harder for all templates you can

02:12:55,070 --> 02:13:02,140
explicitly say say which folder we'll be

02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:02,140
putting on HTML

02:13:19,079 --> 02:13:24,230
static suspecting one for CSP

02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:32,780
inside a commando perspective since

02:13:29,579 --> 02:13:36,389
techniques were speed to Street

02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:40,139
JavaScript and start on CSS so Java

02:13:36,389 --> 02:13:41,909
skills college I was given years for

02:13:40,139 --> 02:13:42,539
name the file extension is killed on

02:13:41,909 --> 02:14:01,079
chains

02:13:42,539 --> 02:14:11,760
but the folder name it's just images is

02:14:01,079 --> 02:14:16,699
also in silence but when you access

02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:16,699
images idea to explicitly say no because

02:14:17,059 --> 02:14:33,980
we are using HTML commitment even not

02:14:30,179 --> 02:14:33,980
sure also the time ICS

02:14:54,649 --> 02:15:14,669
so thank you Darth such next I'm gonna

02:15:06,619 --> 02:15:17,129
but that goes to itself cause we don't

02:15:14,669 --> 02:15:19,519
mind it to be itself the URL so they

02:15:17,129 --> 02:15:19,519
just use

02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:20,160
so these two are similar to what we did

02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:22,410
yourself first one is Xbox for people to

02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:28,310
have died and the second one is sorry

02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:31,820
button autofocus is when H first loads

02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:35,930
then this input box would be the

02:16:31,820 --> 02:16:43,470
automatically selected autocomplete is

02:16:35,930 --> 02:16:46,200
when your browser suggests based on your

02:16:43,470 --> 02:16:50,130
issue let's say you suffer from it your

02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:53,130
name inform you automatically have the

02:16:50,130 --> 02:16:54,570
option itself you have impacted on by in

02:16:53,130 --> 02:16:58,700
this case because we are searching for

02:16:54,570 --> 02:16:58,700
words we don't want that so we'll just

02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:49,170
thanks for creating a mouthful we want

02:17:33,329 --> 02:18:00,989
to get a value then since this time is

02:17:49,170 --> 02:18:06,749
my cap itself does this form something

02:18:00,989 --> 02:18:09,840
to get not posted so it's a request or

02:18:06,749 --> 02:18:12,170
form but yet we'll be doing request of a

02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,170
stock

02:18:25,000 --> 02:19:04,160
before that we need to extract all the

02:18:27,200 --> 02:19:10,640
words from the large problem so by doing

02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:17,660
this with all the words this much recall

02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:24,110
words so now we have maybe order what we

02:19:17,660 --> 02:19:28,870
want to filter then so that only the was

02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:38,210
a study Cuba central research so

02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:40,900
included music using this comprehension

02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:40,900
Python

02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:11,480
then we'll pass these ones into this

02:20:08,971 --> 02:20:11,480
situation

02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:52,280
you guys understand how these levels let

02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:52,280
me explain this so what it does is plus

02:20:53,960 --> 02:21:01,730
and one ofone for each one in this array

02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:38,130
the first thing we are excited they were

02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:44,350
what is the word that will be inside the

02:22:42,521 --> 02:22:45,940
other way because it's for working each

02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:48,840
one week every because there's already

02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:54,510
one airing Oh bollocks

02:22:48,840 --> 02:23:00,149
of the Eastern Utah area so what for

02:22:54,510 --> 02:23:04,290
what it was basically if I look through

02:23:00,149 --> 02:23:08,220
the words and then you have to for every

02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:10,859
what's that help study then you will be

02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:13,859
what so you have to put the insider way

02:23:10,859 --> 02:23:25,649
you can just do it so you have to the

02:23:13,859 --> 02:23:28,109
other words for your go inside so now

02:23:25,649 --> 02:23:31,069
that we have the filter we will now

02:23:28,109 --> 02:23:34,079
display our such a nice general

02:23:31,069 --> 02:23:37,100
similarly we will create such HTML in

02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:37,100
order placeholder

02:23:48,811 --> 02:23:56,131
create an order this similarly using

02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:34,771
what we did before is a form of

02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:39,480
community for each one each other to

02:24:34,771 --> 02:24:39,480
create this item in our modernist

02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:40,700
and thanks to these the the time

02:25:37,310 --> 02:25:43,250
meditations forever and if is mummy pig

02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:47,810
your gap like ready slow is there a

02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:57,850
better way of such a quality what if you

02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:57,850
put a plank on everything

02:26:09,800 --> 02:27:28,069
I don't think so maybe by the estimation

02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:32,080
for this convention I think because you

02:27:28,069 --> 02:27:32,080
have to go to done everything sideways

02:27:34,359 --> 02:27:47,810
you can cut out program then they see in

02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:50,780
order if after they say your greasy once

02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:53,260
if we just be you just so you don't

02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:53,260
actually have to

02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:07,199
she dictionary when by for each would I

02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:10,140
even softer than 40 should have done

02:28:07,199 --> 02:28:11,430
like a first aid you had eggs in the

02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:13,920
dictionary than the second one

02:28:11,430 --> 02:28:15,479
three starter in front of sutra if

02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:18,710
you're reading from filing in an

02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:18,710
emoticon you need to be lined

02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:32,010
reprocessing plant only what is written

02:28:24,989 --> 02:28:42,540
the file will prematurely and you sort

02:28:32,010 --> 02:28:45,750
it and then because when you beat from

02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:48,540
the it's line by line to take itself

02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:56,609
would think that went ivory you can

02:28:48,540 --> 02:29:00,420
avoid reading from the power line so

02:28:56,609 --> 02:29:03,000
right now you're such estimating for may

02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:05,180
include severe they were pinging at the

02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,180
other

02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:35,030
so I know when you want to search idea

02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:37,400
this I would let them and it brings you

02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:40,700
to another page so you can actually use

02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:41,150
to jump mastery week inside it every

02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:44,480
time

02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:51,851
press a button the search will be

02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:59,360
refreshed so if you go from zero so

02:29:51,851 --> 02:30:05,931
searched on HTML inside index.html then

02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:22,101
we a Java square in the bottom here so

02:30:05,931 --> 02:30:25,311
just what you say you know so this light

02:30:22,101 --> 02:30:27,530
spots on the keep any library just a lot

02:30:25,311 --> 02:30:32,061
which allows you to basically change

02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:39,860
them easily change the HTML inside place

02:30:32,061 --> 02:30:41,650
on Xbox we all actually saw meeting and

02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:52,601
sending it back to the server each time

02:30:41,650 --> 02:30:52,601
so first all this inside your index.html

02:30:53,170 --> 02:31:01,990
what this does is take this input which

02:30:57,580 --> 02:31:04,660
is a text the search box on here so

02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:09,040
every time you press it like walkie you

02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:13,540
run this function you'll get you know

02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:20,740
okay I'll get out the way if you want to

02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:26,530
use pulse but yeah so you take the data

02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:29,700
from /search q equal to whatever sits

02:31:26,530 --> 02:31:32,979
idle Xbox currently and using the data

02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:36,430
put it inside is an order this over here

02:31:32,979 --> 02:31:40,930
so we need to take a slight change in

02:31:36,430 --> 02:31:43,330
searched on HTML so we don't wanna we

02:31:40,930 --> 02:31:45,900
don't want them to you don't open up on

02:31:43,330 --> 02:31:45,900
this

02:31:56,591 --> 02:32:05,150
so every time you press a button they

02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:07,841
were taking all of this and put it

02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:07,841
inside

02:32:24,170 --> 02:32:27,830
you don't need a father

02:32:39,189 --> 02:32:47,020
it's a bit slow because now every time

02:32:44,359 --> 02:32:50,350
you press a lot of your rather thing

02:32:47,020 --> 02:33:04,970
then pressing our time to rapidly

02:32:50,350 --> 02:33:09,740
backspace it means not week from the

02:33:04,970 --> 02:33:14,260
fall but you'll have to recheck whatever

02:33:09,740 --> 02:33:14,260
you'll see when is retaking the ones

02:33:16,899 --> 02:33:22,910
first we meet from the father's but so

02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:25,450
let me start over your media open

02:33:22,910 --> 02:33:25,450
everything to us

02:33:28,090 --> 02:33:33,560
just keep doing this every time you

02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:37,270
press a button it shouldn't be a problem

02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:48,080
if raised event lot like these cases

02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:50,750
than 40-thousand think about it's quite

02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:53,319
mascot when you appear every user

02:33:50,750 --> 02:33:55,819
experiences so you don't want them to

02:33:53,319 --> 02:34:03,720
press a button and then there's a delay

02:33:55,819 --> 02:34:08,521
or like so

02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:18,860
that's about it basics of bus now we're

02:34:08,521 --> 02:34:30,960
going to have to host it on Python so

02:34:18,860 --> 02:34:32,580
first have to create a column something

02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:37,500
you create an account you can go to a

02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:40,800
file and then create a new directory for

02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:42,320
what you are to upload so in this case I

02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:44,580
really am good at everything because

02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:49,410
takes some time because you have to

02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:50,391
manually insert one by one so this case

02:34:49,410 --> 02:34:55,190
I did too

02:34:50,391 --> 02:35:01,670
so you all know all about high database

02:34:55,190 --> 02:35:01,670
templates since the big it's templates

02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:12,150
one thing is high because on Python

02:35:09,690 --> 02:35:17,190
anyway when you first create or wherever

02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:20,280
you overwrite I have not by yeah mp4 one

02:35:17,190 --> 02:35:28,620
so you wanna copy it so you can easily

02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:32,670
just by the anywhere when you create a

02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:34,980
web site you will override you on a

02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:37,650
blonde file so if you have an existing

02:35:34,980 --> 02:35:42,150
amplify that so that you want to create

02:35:37,650 --> 02:35:44,670
a web app yeah you were just completely

02:35:42,150 --> 02:35:49,410
ddy where you have changes to the army

02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:52,260
form so one way to do is post you can

02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:54,780
create aware and then up one by one and

02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:56,730
change your which in turn helped on high

02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:59,220
quality but since I already uploaded

02:35:56,730 --> 02:36:01,650
everything I just copy why ever since I

02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:03,860
got high so I can just paste it over one

02:36:01,650 --> 02:36:03,860
side

02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:15,130
their rationale for committing suicide

02:36:13,391 --> 02:36:18,490
you know when you create a new kingdom

02:36:15,130 --> 02:36:19,840
people all day for you and me young but

02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:22,450
then not because you really have a

02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:23,410
library to a liquid in your life get out

02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:28,150
there because you're using the same

02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:31,120
limits so do because they do it later

02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:34,900
students I do mine depressing the final

02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:52,330
film overlap the override you know it's

02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:54,960
just the web site settings itself this

02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:54,960
is where you

02:37:15,229 --> 02:37:36,079
yeah they want you if this file already

02:37:17,989 --> 02:37:38,419
exists is contents we open them you need

02:37:36,079 --> 02:37:59,329
to change a few things in your working

02:37:38,419 --> 02:38:15,649
directory just keep it simple we are

02:37:59,329 --> 02:38:22,419
stepping fossa this one CSS images a

02:38:15,649 --> 02:38:22,419
chemistry yes

02:38:22,989 --> 02:38:28,189
so once you're done configuring you can

02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:37,659
go back there

02:38:28,189 --> 02:38:51,469
as you can see you know they were safe

02:38:37,659 --> 02:38:54,829
so you don't have this you can upload

02:38:51,469 --> 02:38:59,509
your course but I don't think you can

02:38:54,829 --> 02:39:00,490
humble for this so yeah it's quite

02:38:59,509 --> 02:39:04,351
serious

02:39:00,490 --> 02:39:04,351
and I'm like it's just this website

02:39:32,431 --> 02:39:44,141
application you can also access it for

02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:56,410
myself it's not only the same well if

02:39:44,141 --> 02:40:19,150
you want to try wanna try it yeah so

02:39:56,410 --> 02:40:33,550
what it's just it's optional innovative

02:40:19,150 --> 02:40:36,521
whether you can tend to me because now

02:40:33,550 --> 02:40:39,560
is you are hosting this one by video so

02:40:36,521 --> 02:40:43,989
this I achieved we have notion of course

02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:43,989
every poll doing potentially I think

02:40:44,410 --> 02:40:49,970
it's not really getting a sub-domain oh

02:40:48,729 --> 02:40:53,540
yeah

02:40:49,970 --> 02:40:58,390
hope I won't give you any more

02:40:53,540 --> 02:41:00,620
yeah it's obvious have obviously take my

02:40:58,390 --> 02:41:06,890
leave let me create a little some

02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:09,710
optional I told you the dopey name will

02:41:06,890 --> 02:41:14,239
be don't fight anyway if you would like

02:41:09,710 --> 02:41:18,010
to change it yeah yeah I'm not sure how

02:41:14,239 --> 02:41:18,010
much you can customized a little bit

02:41:32,020 --> 02:41:50,319
because you log in using flus

02:42:05,439 --> 02:42:14,689
this step-by-step explanation of how you

02:42:09,379 --> 02:42:18,140
can use one effect is small

02:42:14,689 --> 02:42:21,409
plus I think it's good to know where to

02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:26,839
do it you have to create hockey or it

02:42:21,409 --> 02:42:29,199
abysus I just started CSV to do air is

02:42:26,839 --> 02:42:29,199
good because

02:42:54,670 --> 02:43:06,640
so that wraps up my presentation or you

02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:23,810
have any more questions

02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:24,439
oh this this thing already meet the hot

02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:31,810
diner

02:43:24,439 --> 02:43:31,810
