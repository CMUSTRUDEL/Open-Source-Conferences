Humans have been building bridges for thousands of years, we know how to conceive, design, plan and build them well. Computing is on the other hand is a new and relatively
immature field, having existed for less than a century only. At the same time its practitioners have to take up tremendous responsibilities. In this talk I will discuss why some software projects succeed and others don't and how to increase the likelihood of your project's success. An important part in every project is communication and collaboration among team members. Therefore, I will focus spefically on communication
