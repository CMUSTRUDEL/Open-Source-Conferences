Title: FOSSASIA Academy with Open Technologies, Science Labs & Robots - Marco A. Gutierrez
Publication date: 2019-10-19
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Open Tech
Description: 
	Marco A. Gutierrez, CEO FOSSASIA Academy (Spain)

The FOSSASIA Academy is the first educational institution exclusively focussing on Free and Open Source technologies. The three main goals are to educate students, to develop coding skills and to enable participants to get employed or become entrepreneurs to employ tech talents. In the academy programs students learn to solve coding tasks independently through self-guided learning. Apart from courses for programming languages such as Python, Java, Go, Web technologies and Linux, students work with trainers on hands-on projects in science labs, create AI solutions or develop prototypes of robots.

we have dr. Michael gallis

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,710
he's the directors of CEO of the force

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,570
Asia Academy

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:15,990
he's a pioneers in AI and network

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,949
security cyber securities and he's an

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,869
amazing person who come share with us

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,470
the Faust Asia Academy thank you very

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,560
much thank you hello everyone um I'm

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,140
super excited to be here today I love

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,059
Thailand Bangkok I'm happy that force

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,489
Asia is here I'll be presenting their

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,379
force Asia Academy this is also very

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,530
exciting it's a new project that we're

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,079
working on and it's a new thing that

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,559
we're trying to make it grow and it's

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:54,420
for for everyone for every developer and

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,109
the known developers too so as we talk

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,690
today I think Mario mention it if you

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,949
look at the force Asia repositories in

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,479
github this is where we have our

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,189
projects we have the code there's 226

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,229
repositories I don't know if you can see

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,420
the background is very small and there's

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,740
more than 4,000 people register there

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,970
right so by the time that we've been

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,909
working on all these projects and

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,979
getting people on board we've been we

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,290
we've needed to have documentation we've

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,470
needed to have some trainings for these

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,750
people right so sometimes you get people

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,850
that is super new to code they don't

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,490
know how to do anything they just want

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,470
to collaborate so these people need some

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,720
some sort of training they need some to

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,090
get on board some instructions on how to

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,549
do things then sometimes you even get

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,770
people that are developers but are not

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,540
that they don't know that much about

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,490
your project they don't know that much

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,770
about the technology you're using so

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,360
they also need to be trained so we've

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,280
been doing this for many years this is

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,530
not like something new and we're not

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,070
doing anything new here we just realize

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:06,030
that we we might as well make this into

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,580
a more formal way so that is why we

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,209
created the false icy academy forces the

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,770
academy

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,160
it's an f4 on the force a CSI to make a

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,520
for

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,040
more education system for open

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,810
technologies right so we created the

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,190
first Academy for free and open

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,290
technologies so in this in this economy

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,650
we want to focus on three main pillars

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,340
so we want to have a branch for

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,310
education education so we're gonna have

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,840
courses it's not I'm not saying that we

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,000
it's not as I said it's not something

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,010
new this is like just basically force

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,260
Asia Academy it's becoming the glue that

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,730
puts all together because we've been

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,160
doing workshops we've been doing all

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,900
this all the time but now we're just

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,170
putting it all together in a more formal

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,830
more formal way so as I said we have

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:02,490
three pillars we have education and we

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:06,720
have coding coding part where where the

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:09,660
students will get real-world experience

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,790
and then we will provide employment or

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,860
engagement into the open source

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,870
communities open source companies and

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,560
different types of projects so it's a

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,790
whole it's a whole path for all students

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,100
that they can follow so for education we

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,959
have courses trainings and

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,150
certifications we're walking in

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,440
certifications we don't have them

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,390
available yet we're gonna have

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,400
certifications for force Asia we're

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,860
gonna have certifications we're working

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,410
with the linux professional institute

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:45,600
we're going also working with Singapore

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:48,239
government maybe why not with people in

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,930
Thailand right so that's why we're here

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,850
so terms of Education this is an example

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,360
of the workshops that we did at the last

00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:01,410
first Asia Summit so workshop for people

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,090
to learn new skills this was some of

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,420
them were in collaboration with

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,180
Microsoft some others were the IBM so

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,280
different workshops this actually we

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,989
were providing certificates for this for

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,410
these workshops to people we we collect

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,470
all our workshops on YouTube so we have

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,360
a YouTube channel that you can access so

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,690
this is part of the education that we

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,880
want to put together there's many many

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,010
workshops with that you can learn many

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,670
technologies about many frameworks on

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,890
our YouTube channel we also we're

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,640
starting to do workshops out of the

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:45,260
events so this is actually two workshops

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,610
that we did in Cinque University I think

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,680
we did we did the workshop in Tsinghua

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:57,840
University we did it with a Python

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,460
Python for womens in sanshin so these

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,800
we're starting to do workshops out of

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,570
our own events so that is something that

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,910
we're also working on and we're also

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,480
creating a website so we have Academy

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:12,420
Dodd for Asia or and we're gonna start

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,850
putting courses online so we're going to

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:20,430
also include online courses as part of

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:23,700
our education pillar and then once you

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,300
get educated and once you know what you

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,400
learn about once you learn about the

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,460
technology it's also good to put in in

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,290
practice right so mention Mario mentions

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,330
about code hit code hit is one of the

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,610
programs where you can actually get

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,800
hands-on into real projects which is

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,580
very good and it's a good experience for

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,350
our students we also have hackathons

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,930
this is the unesco hackathons in

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,640
collaboration with unesco we do this is

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,550
the hack I think this one is the one in

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,880
that we did last year in in Singapore

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,740
and the summit we also this is the one

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,220
that we did in Vietnam also in

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,790
collaboration with the nesco and finally

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:09,690
their employment site where we get our

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:12,540
students into real jobs into interest

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:17,669
internships or engage into different

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:20,220
projects right so these are all the

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,830
projects that we got in force Asia so we

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,070
can actually some of them mari already

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,860
mentioned PS lab Susie this is the app

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:33,230
for neural lab we have different ones

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,120
but magics event yay some of them and

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,770
the programs that we have for our

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,260
students that they can join once they

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,770
get some experience we have an advanced

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,860
development

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,320
internship program the google Summer of

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,570
Code google code-in these are programs

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,870
that the students can take part and okay

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,740
they get actually some benefits they get

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,810
paid money or a real real stuff and then

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,230
we have the false ACLs which is our

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,850
incubator so if our students after

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,520
getting the experience after getting the

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,770
education they have some ideas that they

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,380
want to develop we are there to guide

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,600
them through the path into getting a

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,190
real product out there so we have the

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,270
experience we have some connections that

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,340
we can help our students so we we can we

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,990
can put them in practice through the

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:28,330
force HD labs and yes we will have free

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,550
workshops right here so that is

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,430
something very good I'll be personally

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,290
doing so please have a look at the

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,040
schedule because there's so many

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:44,050
workshops there I'll be doing Python 1 &

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,630
2 if you guys have a floor 10 these

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,600
rooms first Python introduction very

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,210
basic and you don't need any any

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,160
knowledge of computers

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,870
you only need to bring a laptop if you

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,860
want a code because it's code along will

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,780
be coding together

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,850
you'll learn and you can take something

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,250
home so this is how we're gonna work

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,610
project-based learning we work together

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,980
and you guys learn second part it would

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,510
be if we have we have more time we have

00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,350
like one hour one hour and a half

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,660
depending on how we go and we'll try to

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,330
get some artificial intelligence data

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,220
science learned with Python so if you

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,430
guys have time and interest please come

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,300
