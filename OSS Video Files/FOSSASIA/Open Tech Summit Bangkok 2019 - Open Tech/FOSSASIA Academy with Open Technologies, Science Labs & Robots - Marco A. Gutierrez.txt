Description: 
	Marco A. Gutierrez, CEO FOSSASIA Academy (Spain)

The FOSSASIA Academy is the first educational institution exclusively focussing on Free and Open Source technologies. The three main goals are to educate students, to develop coding skills and to enable participants to get employed or become entrepreneurs to employ tech talents. In the academy programs students learn to solve coding tasks independently through self-guided learning. Apart from courses for programming languages such as Python, Java, Go, Web technologies and Linux, students work with trainers on hands-on projects in science labs, create AI solutions or develop prototypes of robots.
