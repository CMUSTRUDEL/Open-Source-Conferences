Description: 
	Mario Behling (Germany), CEO OpnTec, Founder FOSSASIA

FOSSASIA's mission is to help people improve their life and society. There are a lot of problems all over the world - poverty, lack of education, over-population, to environmental issues like dirty oceans and climate change. These problems can only be
solved through global cross-border collaboration. Rather than waiting for an elite of scientists, companies and politicians to solve these problems working together on selected projects, these problems are now so big that we need a more radical approach. We need to engage every single person on this planet and enable them to work together and innovate. We cannot afford to waste any talent. We need millions of projects that are developed and run in a sustainable way. In particular we cannot afford to waste any talents from underprivileged sections of society from the global north as well as the south. Everyone needs to be able to develop their skills to become innovators and become part of this essential effort to ensure the survival of the planet. How can we possibly achieve this? How can we develop technologies that enable people to solve these problems? How can the collaboration and sharing model in the FOSS (Free and Open Source) community be an example for a global collaboration? How can economic models around FOSS be an example for sustainable businesses and future entrepreneurs?
