Title: Preparing for the Autonomous Vehicle Era - Tanat Tonguthaisri
Publication date: 2019-10-19
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Open Tech
Description: 
	Tanat Tonguthaisri, National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)

Autonomous vehicle (AV), a.k.a. robotic car, self-driving car, or driverless car has the capability of sensing its environment and moving with little or no human input, the AV is set to revolutionize the way humans travel. The benefits are countless, ranging from reducing road accidents, emissions, drunk driving, and assisting elderlies and the disabled. However, there are also risks and issues that need to be addressed. Questions of how it will be regulated and how it will be liable for accidents or criminal actions still remain unanswered. The government sector continues its attempts to answer these questions through various forms of testing in regulatory sandboxes and use cases. There are dozens of cities around the globe already hosting AV trials, including Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA)â€™s sandbox, as well as Chiba and Semboku cities in Japan. Join in the discussion on making AVs a reality.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
our speakers we have mr. tonight on what

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,880
I see from nasta and STD a he's an

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,429
innovative consultant toonastra the

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,549
another government agencies focusing on

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,190
silent echnology and he also focus his

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,100
domains is in blockchain fintechs and AI

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,760
so please welcome mr. tonight thank you

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,250
very much

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,350
so they come up good morning everyone so

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,300
my name is canet from NASA actually I'm

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,160
no longer than NASA as of today so this

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,199
is a latest development and now be the

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,930
Royal Thai Army I'll be working on

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,230
cybersecurity but I'd be helping out the

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,450
autonomous vehicle community you know to

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,579
develop the actual AV solutions in

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,800
Thailand and although we're not aiming

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,500
for the level 4 level 5 which is like

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,920
fully autonomous solution and but at

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,100
least hopefully we can develop a level 3

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,079
or there's a technical term called a -

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,390
advanced driver assistance system in

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,289
Thailand for the next few years so let's

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,420
see have you caught well since I'm I was

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,939
from NASA I have to promote a little

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,220
work that we've done with the that

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,040
private company so that sensory one of

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,580
the larger property developments in in

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Thailand so sensory fusilli ventures

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,110
which is their corporate venture

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,020
capitalist has signed an MoU with NASA

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,759
so the gentleman the second from your

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,180
left that's one of our executive vice

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,970
president he looked after the automotive

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,530
session and we they decide am or you

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:40,200
along with the venture CTO and congedo

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,610
pot Tom just suck okay I'm off inches by

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,090
the end of this year sensor if you

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,549
launch a Township called t77 along sue

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,460
compute 77 is a new concept of having

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,579
the large community together so the size

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,829
of t77 is about 40 acres and the longest

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,829
road and longest path from the front

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,799
gate to the deepest side of T 77 and

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,360
it's about two kilometers long long by

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,149
the end of this year center we moved at

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,320
headquarter along with 3,000 staff to

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,940
g77

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,610
so they are looking for solutions to

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,610
help with the transportation mobility of

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,340
their staff as well as

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,370
and people in the communities inside t77

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,549
they are going to be about eight

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,349
condominiums from varying in sizes the

00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:27,330
primary school community mall called

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,670
cohabit oh and they are working together

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,909
with Hobart to to have that community

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,480
more so they allow us to use that

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:39,390
property to be a sandbox and test the AV

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,760
solutions in the long term goal and that

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,319
NASA along with our new ministry this

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,290
used to be known Ministry of Science and

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,810
Technology but now we are known as in

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,810
short it's called messy so mhes

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,450
RI that's Ministry of Higher Education

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,459
science research and innovation our

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,440
three years ago is too heavy autonomous

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,170
shuttle service but again we're not

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,470
aiming for level 4 or low level 5 VI

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,329
only have at most level 3 partly because

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,920
of the regulations that we have to work

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:13,560
on ministry of transport as well we have

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,319
the MOU Minister of Transport and they

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,940
are looking up to our prototype before

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,139
we can proceed with the proper

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,700
regulations now in terms of talent

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,700
development we want to bring something

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,739
fun to to Thailand Amazon Web Services

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,319
and during them measure a new event

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,540
reinvent am normally happening in

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,200
November each year in Las Vegas and they

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,690
launch this new toy called

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,540
beep eraser essentially it's a beauty

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,209
and hardware you know I'm equipped with

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,329
all this lettuce lettuce technology for

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,060
toika people who want to get involved

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,829
only needs to implement one of the AI

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,400
technique called reinforcement learning

00:03:52,829 --> 00:04:00,120
and so the bracer allows you know the

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,250
shorter time to to learn this rlr

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,299
reinforcement learning model in a fun

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,400
way we are looking into bring to bring

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,680
the press early in Thailand at the

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,180
moment about 2022 physical leaks

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,260
across a wall and there are six virtual

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,349
leaks

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,109
Amazon Web Services the public sector

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,969
staff is working with one of the

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,409
university which is K MIT our I'm King

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:26,070
mo could Institute of Technology Lac

00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:30,450
about

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,460
to develop academic programs on

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,670
autonomous vehicle and hopefully they

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,680
can train their students to win a race

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,380
and then we can use that as a magnet to

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,500
bring the deeper as a physical league to

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,670
to Thailand in you know in next year or

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,900
so okay this isn't an unrelated

00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:53,490
development

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,350
I assure you shortly how it is how it is

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,650
involved with you know tie another tie

00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:02,010
generosities so Nvidia again that I'm

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:06,990
dr. fouch own and is using the cloud

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:09,840
computing computational power DX one for

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,690
the edge computing for automotive they

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,580
have this product called drive platform

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,920
and the latest are the most powerful

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,210
edge computing for automotive is drive

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,350
HDX Pegasus and the reading is about 320

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,930
tops cups is different from

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:30,690
teraflops it is used for floating point

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,730
operation only but tops you can use two

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:37,820
for calculation for both integers and

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:41,220
floating point so 20 and 20 tops that's

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,140
equated to be about 80 teraflops so it's

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,780
about one tenth of the proper processing

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,740
power of the GX one but remember that it

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,510
is an H device so it is quite powerful

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,100
one of the university in the south and

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,010
Thailand that Sprint's on high unicity

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,690
Hagia campus they've been experimenting

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,570
computer vision with autonomous vehicle

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:04,200
there is computing right now they

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:07,160
realize on a smaller scale each device

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,210
from Nvidia as well call Jetson Jetson

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,640
unfortunately is designed for you know

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,950
CCTV or the traffic controller board

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,390
it's not designed for automotive so it

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,790
gets overheated

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,830
very easily so Nvidia launched this

00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,600
product instead and they have partnered

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,140
with one of the you know well-known very

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,020
long established car maker that's Volvo

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,720
to have the attributing install in the

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,660
so called honest Rico solutions so

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,910
Prince on community is going to procure

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,780
that

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:42,830
very shortly nasa is one of the contact

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:45,500
point that we want to smooth things true

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,870
between dealing with the Wenders and the

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,170
economic sectors so hopefully we can see

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,570
the dry platform you know am being

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,520
experimented in thailand soon i have to

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,100
note that dry platform is only available

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,130
in 8 countries not including Thailand so

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,980
we have to go to an immediate Singapore

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:07,340
prove ourself that of our and enthusiasm

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,620
to to work on autonomous vehicle and we

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,990
had to get authorization from Nvidia

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,420
Japan who look after drop head form in

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,680
the Asia Pacific and before we can

00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:22,790
procure that ok so that's a quick recap

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,290
we talked about t77 the bracer and the

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,270
measure panel is going to be Kingman

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,850
could in in larger bang

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,320
we also talking about one of the talking

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,110
with one of the holdings company of the

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,330
telco or telecommunication company they

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,590
want to sponsor this event and again it

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,060
came through channel of NASA

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,330
so now NASA I going to be the

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,480
intermediary to connect them together

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,680
Infineon is one of the hardware

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,740
manufacturers if you don't is also

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,740
having the an autonomous vehicle leave

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,650
of their own so in Finland is already a

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,800
partner of Kim I am ITL so what we are

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,650
thinking is after launching depressor

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,050
Lee the oppressor only involved with the

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,880
surface layer which is reinforcement

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,100
learning and the hardware itself is

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,800
pre-built by Amazon Web Services but in

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,200
the long run if we can get the students

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,600
to work on the hardware itself are using

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,490
in Infineon Technologies and we can

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,470
combine both reinforcement learning

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,320
models through Amazon Web service cloud

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,660
or other cloud provider and with the

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,400
hardware that students can customize on

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,060
their own using in Infineon framework

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,120
and ok we talked about maybe a drive

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,750
open mortise is a startup from Silicon

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,680
Valley they created from Y Combinator in

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,590
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,080
the founders were work with Pierre in

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:48,399
Farina in Italy so let me just show you

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,310
kind of design so the the outer layer

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,420
the look and feel of their vehicles are

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:58,000
very modern and unlike many other AV

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,490
solutions and that concept is to have a

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,510
modular design think of your phone when

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,829
your battery is kind of a depleted break

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,160
now instead of changing your entire

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,950
phone you can just change the batteries

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,140
if your screen is broken you can just

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,570
change the screen so concept of open

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,120
models is everything is modular you can

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,089
adapt everything according to your needs

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,010
for example this vehicle is designed for

00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,820
passenger's car but if you want to use

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,920
that for logistics you can change the

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,550
top you don't need any you don't need

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,740
any seeds from passengers you can change

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,390
it to the holding space for cargo and so

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,269
that's the concept of open models so we

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,089
are working with them to bring open

00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:44,890
models concept to Thailand we are

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,140
connecting suppliers of different parts

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,270
from you know the steering the breakings

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,060
the powertrain are to the seats the

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,370
outer layer the lighting so hopefully in

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,149
the next few years we might see very

00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:02,709
nice-looking electric and autonomous

00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:04,209
vehicle on the closed area we I left out

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:06,220
the part about public road yet because

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:08,500
we don't have the rules and regulations

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,959
in place yet but hopefully we have that

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,740
soon and just back shortly and we are

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,060
also working on the consortium

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,560
partnering between private and public

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,380
sectors and also the REC regulators and

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,100
also we want to have this roadmap about

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,740
if you want to have AV well I'm running

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,510
on this closed area or even on the

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,730
public road in the next ten or twenty

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,740
years what we need to do so yeah we are

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,670
working with a few governing bodies or

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,350
public sectors and diversities and to

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,310
work on that white paper which will be

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,850
publicized one day it is ready okay a

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,760
few point about open source open data

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,399
and for example the positioning of AV we

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,620
rely on GNSS the NSSC the is a multi

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,110
narak term of GPS GPS

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,210
the us name really it's not a general

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,370
term generic term is TN SS RTO

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,040
navigational satellite system is allowed

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,350
you to find a positioning of each object

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,480
in this case this autonomous vehicle and

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,760
the more accurate solution of GNSS is

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,250
our TK or return kinematics it's allowed

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,950
you to pinpoint down to millimeters

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,589
accuracy and there's a open source

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,589
library called articulate so that's part

00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:26,960
of the open source initiative the second

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,660
part of federated learning this is a new

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,970
concept of if you have the private data

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,220
install in your own devices and you do

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,310
not want to expose that data how you can

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,640
train and improve your you know a IR

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,760
deep learning model federated learning

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,339
allows you allows each device who wasn't

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,990
here to participate to train on and

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,940
update the model in their own device and

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,890
then they send only the waiting the

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,170
adjusted weight back to the central

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,290
server and the central server will read

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:59,150
the rate of these models together

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,100
actually from memory tomorrow being the

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,690
2nd of October and in the evening I

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,490
think there's a meet-up the first meetup

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,910
on federated learning and just go to

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,100
me.com look a federated learning the

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,350
organizer actually work it and do Trask

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,720
of Google and do trance is one of the

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,450
pioneer in federate learning in google

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,190
deepmind you can learn more about how

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,910
favorite learning work may be in

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,820
standard use case for federated learning

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:29,600
we will have a new role new jobs role

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,180
called better labeler so when you have

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,850
this raw data you need to tell you need

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,430
to label them too so that you can train

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,459
the aia model accordingly this can be a

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,140
new new jobs for for the industry I'm

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,470
already Amazon Web Services they have

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,080
this concept that you can employ a

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,300
physical worker and real human worker

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,580
to do your dirty work you know those

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,950
tedious mundane work and call Mechanical

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,750
Turk so you pay this very low fee and

00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,760
you get you actual human to do certain

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,650
things for you but it's very simple

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,050
tasks for example I'm labeling data is

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,510
one of the tasks in China you have these

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,820
chop shops right and heave-ho just go in

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,860
in from their computers label the data

00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,450
all day long and use this label director

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,220
trained your AI Mordor

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,980
so at sauna most vehicle we need to rely

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,960
on its label data as well and we have

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,300
open source better set this is a very

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,750
good direction for the autonomous Vico

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:26,420
community by far there are three major

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,790
players MFT you might not know active

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,340
but you might have heard of neutona me

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,700
new tirana me is a autonomous vehicle

00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,100
startup or more towards robot hexie so I

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,990
don't miss taxi service in Singapore and

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,980
they've been acquired by active and they

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,960
open data said call new scenes also echo

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,150
goes by our code on AI and they just

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,570
open up that recently and also way more

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,190
I'm okay if you are interested in

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,620
training images for the newest vehicle

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,970
you can look up this credit data set if

00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,980
you saleable as an open data interesting

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,860
development and let me see okay I don't

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,220
have much time how can I show me Cherie

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,470
introduce me to mapillary it's the open

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,840
their a street map you can contribute

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,450
you know and if you are if you love

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,520
traveling and new Camry and you carry

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,670
your smartphone along you know take

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,310
photos uploaded it it you can help with

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:27,080
a community build another open data for

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:28,580
street maps as well okay open in the

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,350
face of alliance OSA

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:35,030
that's another open source initiative

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:37,550
for 5g connectivity even the

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,770
connectivity side some of the libraries

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,260
are proprietary but the major player

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:45,260
knows that open source community view

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,440
drive the adoption of this technology so

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:54,860
they allow certain part of the codes to

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:56,960
be open source okay in sony sony is

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,670
building an autonomous vehicle but with

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,680
a new concept within entertainment in

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,860
mind so people sitting the passengers

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,320
I'm sitting inside can see the interior

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm to be the entertainment and while

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,730
they are moving along and the outside

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,130
you can also have another business model

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,200
you can display advertisement as well

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,120
for the other people so this is gonna be

00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,470
a new business model for the new era

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,080
once we have the autonomous vehicle

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,970
running on the street effective are is a

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,160
company who specialize in comic

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,829
motivation in this case it can be

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,319
why to detect the emotion on the state

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,240
of the chauffeur or the drivers whether

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,680
or not they are sleepy whether or not

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,000
they're they're using their mobile

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,370
without considering on the road

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,290
this is especially harmful if you are

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,019
not on the level five fully autonomous

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,300
vehicle and it still required driver

00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,490
attention on the road perceptive

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,579
automata claims that it can understand

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,800
human and behaviors for example human

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:57,490
surrounding you either the pedestrian or

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,839
the drivers in the car nearby you

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,529
perceptive Automator claimed that they

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,149
can anticipate that decision what what

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,589
they are going to do next which allow

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:09,470
autonomous vehicle to act

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:11,629
you're your own autonomous vehicle when

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,819
you are sitting in to act appropriately

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:19,879
and improve the safety and we have

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:24,709
standards normal automotive standards

00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:29,449
functional safety ISO 26262

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:32,930
that's for the system to fail can it

00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:35,480
fail safely without having caused any

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:39,860
accidents where's D and another ISO

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,899
standard 21 448 it checked whether or

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,420
not the intended functionality actually

00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:47,630
safe because even though it works as

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:51,980
planned but the design itself might not

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:55,310
be safe so these two standards a

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,290
complement and other most vehicle the

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,630
most important components because we are

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,689
we want to focus on safety so the

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,220
braking system is very crucial and at

00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,549
the moment there are two manufacturers

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:12,049
that have this extra safe braking system

00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:15,020
so Bosh Bosh and Continental and the

00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,309
Ministry of you know I'm messy higher

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,799
education science research and

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,970
innovation is working with one of them

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,650
actually we want to work with two of

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,630
them with both of them but only one of

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,449
them can be that so we are going to

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,240
trial one of their product on our

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,039
autonomous vehicle prototype and we have

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,280
to go through understand this like euro

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,150
end cap and and see how Singapore the

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,870
land

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:42,690
transport authority LTA they have this

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:45,390
technical reference TR 68 which actually

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,539
allowed them to skyrocket in the

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,950
autonomous vehicle readiness index to be

00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,850
number two in the world according to

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,950
KPMG they're only second to the Dutch or

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,720
the Netherlands because of this year are

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,240
six to eight so let's go through quickly

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,510
so there are four parts in here 668

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,520
about basic behavior of stand-alone

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,159
autonomous vehicle not connected and

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,230
connected and connectivity become in a

00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,929
later part so essentially how it

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,450
interprets the road signs the lanes the

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:18,559
marking signals and so on and how the

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:24,409
policy and rules design in a framework

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:26,159
safety Elon Musk Lex Friedman of MIT

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,289
people who work in the autonomous

00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,570
vehicle industry in the US they all

00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,039
agree that the most important thing

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,830
about autonomous vehicle is to promote

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:38,730
Road Safety so safety is a very crucial

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:42,960
part and for anyone want to to get into

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,450
this arena so in Singapore they they

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,419
focus on on this part and they focus on

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,929
how a V can be operated safely in on the

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,270
public road in Thailand I first see the

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,620
the suit the soon is that we can see

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,659
that happening for it's probably 10

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,080
years right but thing about am I see it

00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:04,200
in three years in this part they also

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,940
have various use cases for Singapore so

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,830
if Thailand is to follow suit we can

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,159
they have to define our own use cases

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,919
and ensure that they are road safety

00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:16,620
suitable for those use cases as well and

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,549
there are many system level safety and

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:23,330
you know functional and operational oh

00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:25,230
and if you see the third bullet about

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,880
people involved with the autonomous

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,030
vehicle whether or not they are weaker

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,230
developer si or system in integrator or

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:36,270
even the operator system or operator in

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,640
Singapore they say you and they need to

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,559
be competent organization okay and they

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,919
need to have a proper quality management

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,900
system and also it is it needs to be

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,730
supported by a competent personal so

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,930
this is something that our government

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,660
needs to work on as well

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,330
to certify the competent organization

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,250
and what is the proper quality

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,260
management system and how to certify

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,300
competent personnel to to to to

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:05,580
supported and cybersecurity is another

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,910
crucial example and even in the Western

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,680
world people in automotive do not know

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,620
much about cybersecurity but you know

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,990
that in DEFCON blackhat con people

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,540
hacked Tesla people hacked folks folks

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,120
punkin all the time but these hackers

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,490
they don't come to automotive exhibition

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,700
or conference and they only gathered

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,730
himself in this kind of hackers related

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,350
computer key conference so we need to

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,840
connect both well together and ensure

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,020
that autonomous vehicle manufacturers

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,780
also concerned about cybersecurity

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:42,360
standards and best practice and the

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,970
parts like they are part with the cyber

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,980
physical meaning that they are part that

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,230
traditional automotive and company

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,330
combinational part that interact

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,070
together and that computational part can

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,520
control the physical part of the

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,680
automotive that needs to be tested

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,390
against any cybersecurity threat

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,700
otherwise you know if you've seen the

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,310
Fast and the Furious I'm not sure which

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,210
may be part seven or something I think

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:11,790
the bad guy hack into they use the zero

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,590
day threat to hack into autonomous

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,950
vehicle and get them to work according

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,140
to their you know malicious plan but if

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:24,930
there are proper controls and checks in

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:27,150
place that can never happen okay this

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,060
part this last part on TR six to eight

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,320
is about connectivity so again in

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,780
Thailand is going to be a long long time

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,490
because we need infrastructure for

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,830
example and doctor pusong mentioned

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,780
about 5g testbed with the cassettes

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,060
atomicity in serious our campus they had

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,150
a very first site that have this 50

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,670
infrastructure but it's being rolled out

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:51,600
across the country very slowly

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:55,530
hopefully there will be more test bed

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,780
for 5g and we can we can test on you

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:00,539
know the 5g application if we might see

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:04,789
the latest new that one of the minister

00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:08,570
and have has control and a vehicle from

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:12,089
far away the weaker self is in Hawaii

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,269
operated by Princeton University

00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:17,789
the minister dr. so with Mason C is in

00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:20,549
he was in Bangkok and he controlled his

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:23,039
vehicle during the heavy rain situation

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,839
so apparently they have rain attenuation

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,429
on the signal as well but they managed

00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:31,709
to have this successful launch

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:36,929
successful test and by the 5g Network

00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:39,209
also sponsored by AAS again this is for

00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,799
the connectivity level for level 5 it's

00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:43,829
gonna be a long long time Thailand also

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,529
needs to work on the data infrastructure

00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,149
as well for that to happen

00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:50,909
just a quick this is my last full slide

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:54,059
avri autonomous vehicle readiness index

00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:58,559
according to KPMG so they they have they

00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:01,559
index to the top 25 capable countries on

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,359
a V they they break down into the four

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,609
pillars for first one apparently is

00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,619
policy and legislation rest assured that

00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:09,659
Ministry of Transport there are sub

00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:12,329
departments like Department of Land

00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:14,669
Transport components on Campbell there's

00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:16,349
an departments of highway comm tangle

00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,839
one departments of rural roads chrome

00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:21,449
Tanglin aboard and office of the

00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,249
transportation policy OTP also know

00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:25,649
fostering and your bike and console they

00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:27,539
are working on the autonomous vehicle

00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:31,319
policy they are involved with our

00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,029
roundtable discussion on AV but we need

00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,940
they actually need to see the actual

00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:37,169
prototype we thought before they can

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:41,940
draft the legislation and rules

00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:44,479
accordingly technology and innovation

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,209
apparently there's a buzz word with the

00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:49,289
public organization called PPP

00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:51,269
public-private partnership so we are

00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:52,889
promoting that in Thailand as well so we

00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,599
need to partner with you know and the

00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:57,959
private companies to work on the AV

00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:01,889
solutions and we need more investment on

00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:04,229
the AV related firm and how researchers

00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:07,589
our scholarship students who came back

00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:10,200
from overseas bringing their knowledge

00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:11,850
from their professors from the US Europe

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,529
Japan

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:19,059
together to build this local localized

00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:20,620
solution for a V also we also need the

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,870
more market share on evey as well

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,090
because evey even though we don't need

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:29,169
electric vehicle but electric vehicle

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,659
will actually help with development of a

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:34,600
V because autonomous vehicle rely on

00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,759
sensors sensors use electricity so these

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,879
sensors can be in so very easily on Evie

00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,830
but you can work on these sensors or the

00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,919
autonomous function on the traditional

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,720
internal combustion engine or IC e those

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,049
cars that use petrol and it can be done

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,710
as well infrastructure this is not only

00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,789
the data or IT infrastructure not only

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,250
telecommunication infrastructure but

00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:59,379
also the quality of roads rest assured

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,990
that you know if you live in Thailand

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:05,799
long enough you know the quality of our

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:07,029
road but rest assured that the relevant

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,700
departments they are working to improve

00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:12,250
the quality of our roads so that AV can

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,299
be adopted in and I'm sooner rather than

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,509
later

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,399
also logistic Performance Index logistic

00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:22,360
industry will be one of the demand side

00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:26,860
or the demand who and that let's see the

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:30,039
AV in trucks or you know in in in cargo

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,860
transportation and to be adopted in near

00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,769
future I think this is my last slide

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:38,379
public awareness we see in I think

00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:41,049
Pittsburgh way more operated on public

00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:43,059
road on Pittsburgh but certain people

00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:45,309
who might be in technophobia and they

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:48,490
actually grab baseball bat and smash on

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,470
the car you know because they do not

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,509
understand how autonomous vehicle can

00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,429
help improve their quality of life so

00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,500
again we need to engage the users the

00:25:54,429 --> 00:26:00,309
general public from the very early stage

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:03,220
I'm true you know various measures in in

00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:05,980
this slide again I do not have my

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,110
contact details that if you like you can

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,259
reach me a wide line line application my

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,210
ID is social so that's me socil that's

00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,399
my line ID I'll look at my phone and in

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,799
LinkedIn I'm more than happy to connect

00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:19,600
with you and if you are interested in

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,659
the round Table Talk you do not need any

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,130
technical background even being and also

00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,750
we are more than welcome

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,540
because again this last lie is about

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,490
engaging the general public to be aware

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,780
about the upcoming autonomous vehicle

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:37,980
solutions so thank you very much thank

00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,980
