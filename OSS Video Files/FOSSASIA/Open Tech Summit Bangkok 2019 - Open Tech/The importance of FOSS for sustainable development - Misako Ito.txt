we have our longtime partners UNESCO has

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,309
been with us Asia for 10 years so let me

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:18,720
introduce you to miss Masako Ethel's

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:20,580
from UNESCO thank you thank you good

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,449
morning and thank you for the

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,090
introductions welcome to the first open

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,689
tech summit in Thailand which is for the

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,399
first time

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,489
Corgan eyes with force Asia and UNESCO

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,879
and the kindly hosted by the National

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,879
Innovation agency so we have a

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:47,340
long-standing relationship with force

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:49,860
Asia UNESCO has been one key UN agency

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,300
supporting the free and open source

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,829
software from more than 10 years and we

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,730
have been also supporting the

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:03,090
communities and so in that presentation

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,090
I would like to introduce why why we are

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,369
supporting that and why free and

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,689
open-source software is so relevant for

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:18,390
the new sustainable development agenda

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:22,740
2030 okay so you may probably know that

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,170
UNESCO is a UN agency that was created

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,979
at the end of the Second World War after

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,680
having seen all these horror related to

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,740
the second war with the beautiful

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,170
mandate to create peace in the mind of

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,579
men and women and we do that through

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,680
education science culture and

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:46,530
communications and we have a very very

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,619
important mandate in our Constitution

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,070
which is here which is to promote the

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,380
free flow of ideas by wooden images and

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,750
maintain and increase and diffuse

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,920
knowledge which is really at the heart

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:06,899
of the spirit behind behind the force

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:11,610
and so our work with in the area of

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,800
software has started 20 years ago where

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,900
we actually UNESCO

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,380
has been developing free and open-source

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,970
software a long time ago in the area of

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:27,600
data management data mining statistics

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:30,120
one of the most famous one is CVS Isis

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,330
which has four libraries small library

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,550
management's and then we started to

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,070
advocate for free and open source

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,680
software supporting the communities and

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,930
now we are really applying the

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,110
principles and the model which are

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,030
behind the free and open source software

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:52,770
across the organization within the

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,870
organizations and we believe that the

00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,570
free and open source software will be

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,710
more and more important and relevant

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,850
with the adoption of the 2030 agenda for

00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:08,190
sustainable development because

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,610
sustainable development requires to

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,250
integrate into any company's business

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,430
model that concern for the environment

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,790
and also the concern for the society

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:25,160
which is such as you know waste

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,160
management the use of Natural Resources

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:40,350
inclusion agenda equality diversity and

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:43,860
the social condition of off staff etc so

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:47,250
why why force is so relevant for

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,310
sustainable development because as you

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:54,510
all know it's required partnerships not

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:57,110
only within the organization but with

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:01,709
extend a group which leads to

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:04,230
innovations new ideas there is also the

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:08,760
culture of contribution which is very

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,370
much deep in force which also ensure the

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,910
stability and longevity of the project

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,340
because it's it's depend on us to to

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,130
make it sustainable and to sustain it's

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,840
not locking in

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:27,410
in the hand a few few people there is

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,380
also a return of on investment from the

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:35,360
core abilities through the use reused

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:38,930
yet the adaptations and UNESCO is

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,150
actually applying those principles and

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,010
value which are the core of behind force

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,580
within our organization so let me

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,600
present you some of the activities so we

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:57,110
have been already doing I guess yes two

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:02,660
or three hackathon at force Asia Summit

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:05,420
where we provided opportunities to meet

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,380
discuss and collaborate with diverse

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,290
group the last hackathon we did was we

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:16,160
managed force Asia bringing the

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:19,300
community of open tech developers and

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,690
UNESCO brought some indigenous

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:28,340
participant to to find together some

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,780
solution to the to the to the linguistic

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,670
diversity and the need to safeguard

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,370
indigenous languages and we did that for

00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:41,630
the International Year of indigenous

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:45,620
languages which is this year we also

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:49,510
support the the building of the coding

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,880
skill amongst the young generations and

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,240
this is the initiative that sees we do

00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,560
this to use mobile initiative where we

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,950
also support the use of free and open

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,760
source software and UNESCO also release

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:10,220
all our publication through under the

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,510
open access policy which means that

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:19,280
anything that UNESCO produce you can

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:21,530
copy-paste translate uses as far as you

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,620
bring back you inform UNESCO and you

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:29,000
bring back to the global communities as

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:33,110
a global Commons so we are the first UN

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,650
agencies doing that we also promote

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:39,800
the principle of openness on internet

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:43,009
development and tomorrow we will be

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,289
hosting a workshop on Internet

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:50,720
assessment based on UNESCO's agreed

00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:54,349
indicators which is called indicators

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,860
for Internet universality which actually

00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:00,949
based on forking principles for need for

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,460
a healthy internet ecosystem which can

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:08,650
work for everybody and we say that the

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:12,110
Internet should be a human right based

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:15,560
open based on open standards provide

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:19,330
opportunities for small enterprise to

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,440
grow accessible in terms of

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:27,889
accessibility for marginalised groups

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,460
people with disabilities women and girls

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,740
and I need a vision relating to the

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,060
Internet should be driven by multi

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,940
stakeholder participation so we will be

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,770
presenting tomorrow starting at night in

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,400
UNESCO workshop where you are all

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:50,240
welcome to to come the assessment

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,569
framework and how we are applying this

00:07:50,240 --> 00:08:01,610
to the case of Internet development in

00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:05,440
Thailand and we also as part of our our

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,969
Monday to promote free free access to

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,330
free and open source software we also

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:13,729
promote the preservation and access to

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,110
software source code as a heritage

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:22,300
because we believe in the importance of

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:25,819
preserving source code from the past

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:31,099
which contain the knowledge and the

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:33,529
intelligence of developers for to make

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:37,159
them available for future generations

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:40,610
there is no such a library in the area

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,570
of software source code like you know

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,509
you can find it in order

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:50,750
scientific areas so this is a new

00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:55,279
initiative which is a led by colleague

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:59,690
my colleague in Paris Davide Stolte and

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,089
we also promote every year it was last

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,500
Saturday the International Day for

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:08,149
universal access to information which is

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,560
traditionally known as the right to know

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:17,600
day so it's provide opportunities for

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,060
people to to mobilize for their own

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,509
right to access to information whether

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,829
it is governmental informations or any

00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:33,590
public information held by public bodies

00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:38,009
and yes and that is thank you very much

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,009
