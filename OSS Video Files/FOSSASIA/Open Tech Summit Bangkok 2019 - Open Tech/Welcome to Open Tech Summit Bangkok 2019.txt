Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Open Tech
Description: 
	We believe in making a difference, in using technology as a force to make a positive impact in people’s lives. As FOSSASIA's Mission Statement says, we are “bringing together an inspiring community across borders and ages to form a better future with Open Technologies and ICT.” Last month, at the UN Climate Change Summit, it took a 15-year-old girl to confront the global establishment with the words: “How Dare You?”. If we adopt that as our mantra for the next two days, this summit of OpenSource family members in Bangkok will help walk the talk of two more masterpiece UN slogans, “Creating the Future we Want” and “Leaving No-One Behind.”
