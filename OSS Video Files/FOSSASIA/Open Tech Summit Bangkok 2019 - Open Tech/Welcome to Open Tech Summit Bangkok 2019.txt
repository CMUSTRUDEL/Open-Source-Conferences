Title: Welcome to Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019
Publication date: 2019-10-18
Playlist: Open Tech Summit Bangkok 2019 - Open Tech
Description: 
	We believe in making a difference, in using technology as a force to make a positive impact in people’s lives. As FOSSASIA's Mission Statement says, we are “bringing together an inspiring community across borders and ages to form a better future with Open Technologies and ICT.” Last month, at the UN Climate Change Summit, it took a 15-year-old girl to confront the global establishment with the words: “How Dare You?”. If we adopt that as our mantra for the next two days, this summit of OpenSource family members in Bangkok will help walk the talk of two more masterpiece UN slogans, “Creating the Future we Want” and “Leaving No-One Behind.”

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,260
advantage of the opportunities we also

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,540
need to start preparing the risks and

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,140
threats to ensure that we truly do not

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,000
leave anyone behind especially those at

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,860
the lower rungs of the ladder and those

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,080
who become victim of natural disaster

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,990
conflict displacement geopolitical and

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,880
geo-economic disruptions it's only the

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,790
last two decades that technology has

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,860

decades have in stores so let's go on
