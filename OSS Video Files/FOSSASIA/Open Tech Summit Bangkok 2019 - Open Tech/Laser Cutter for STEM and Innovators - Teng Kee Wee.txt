How can a Lasercutter benefit students in their STEM education and get them ready to be innovators and entrepreneurs? This is one goal we aim for with the Lasercraft cutter of Lionsforge. Designed from the the ground up to be reliable, user friendly and maintenance free the CraftLaser is a valuable ally to any crafter and a new source of revenue for entrepreneurs. How you use it and what you create with it is only limited by the imagination.

we are a process of going through how we

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,950
can foster the application of free open

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,759
source and open software so one of our

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,800
next speakers is mr. Kavita like dr.

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,039
panade say we just not software we also

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,810
have a hardware side and he's promoting

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,609
how hard words open sauce and

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,890
technologies can be accessed throughout

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:31,380
the world please welcome mr. Kiwi thank

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:34,739
thank you all right

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,040
good morning Kiwi CEO of line fortune st

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:42,030
company so the what I'm gonna show today

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,850
I'm sorry some of the projects that

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,289
we're doing is hardware project so um so

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,840
the company started off with first

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,930
statement how are we going to use open

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,370
source technology even from the whole

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,680
process using open source software like

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,740
open ket to developed hardware products

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,870
that push to the international market so

00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,489
[Music]

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,580
nobody has really yet moved to gist

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,430
journey by producing products how a

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,470
product especially that code true safety

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,060
certification and become a professional

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:22,500
product in the market so in a way we

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,409
embarked on a experiment to produce such

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,990
a product so craft laser which is

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,119
actually a professional laser cutter

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:36,180
that's developed her percent open source

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,530
and we've done this project I think we

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,780
started this project alone in last year

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,220
so it took us one and a half year to

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,140
raise funding get the product done

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,890
produce study fight and right now we're

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,259
sort I think over the world from us or

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:58,890
way to Korea and Europe on this machine

00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:01,950
so without going too much into details I

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:07,770
can quickly share what exactly is this

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:11,459
laser color okay so the cross Lisa is

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,830
actually the worst safest cutting laser

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,860
is also the only

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,210
cutter in the world is also the most

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,400
compact and lightweight system you can

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,400
see that we brought the machine down

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,130
here at level 10 we just fly all the way

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,860
in from Singapore I just carry it along

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,030
so it's like a check-in luggage you can

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,890
see it's very compact it's all in one

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,450
system and it's hard percent

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,510
open-source so this project as you can

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,210
see we are trying to create values in

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,870
the product that is based on open-source

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:47,760
and it's not just some things like a

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,660
makeup project that doesn't go anywhere

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,350
so we decided that we took on these

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,500
seriously and push as hard as you can to

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:04,880
get the product into the market in less

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:07,140
than a year so some of the features that

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,310
are gonna show here I mean there are

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,170
terminologies that you may not know but

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,050
what I'm trying to show down here is

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,510
that when you push a hardware into the

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,750
market there are a lot of safety

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,510
requirements there are safety standards

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,550
you need to follow test it before you

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,120
can actually put a product into the

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,820
market some of the example are like for

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,200
example for laser cutter you need to be

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,540
there's four casters so for us is a

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,519
class one laser which means that despite

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,519
the fact that is a cutting laser is as

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,000
safe as your CD player that's class one

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,530
certification and also we are also NFPA

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,670
NFPA the National Fire Protection

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,100
Association standard 86 compliance

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:54,330
meaning that we are also the only laser

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:58,950
cutter that complies with fire

00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:04,080
protection standards so NFPA 86 requires

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,239
any insignia system for combustion oven

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,070
standard so in this laser cutter we

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,019
actually have that kind of safety

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:15,390
features then again yes also is only

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,630
less than fifty pounds which means is

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,209
only about 23 kg there is actually part

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,880
of the OSHA requirement for anything

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,130
that's nearly portable in it weighs less

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,120
than 50 pound if not otherwise is not

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,639
portable

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,849
so other good features it has I guess is

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,219
on the in filter a filter cooling system

00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:44,080
and some asses for good laser cutting

00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:46,419
and is extremely easy to use so we've

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,639
got all those features this allows us to

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,580
actually push a product into the market

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,150
so you can see from the photographs we

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:58,479
are already delivered to Korea to a lot

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,439
of schools in Singapore and so down

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,259
there you can see that we're actually

00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,800
having a workshop inside the library so

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:11,169
that's how safe the laser cutter is and

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,270
so what we'll see later after the in the

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,129
afternoon please come up to level 10th

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,610
and thence the machines there we can do

00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:21,310
some demonstration hands-on if not this

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,579
oh I have thank you

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,579
