00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,430
Summit 2019 it was the first summit in

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,430
Thailand yes we had meetups I joined

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,520
your coder dojos and yeah things happen

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,920
but like M it was a big experiment many

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,239
things we didn't know and like it always

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,039
happens when you go to another country

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,110
you organise something there are things

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,510
we don't know there's like sometimes

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,449
internal politics yes cultural issues

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,280
cultural issues and so on but like the

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,530
magic of the free and open source

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,260
community is that we can overcome this

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,790
so we often overcome this online many

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,950
people in the chat for example our

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,110
projects we see that people from India

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,430
and Pakistan work together when the news

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,710
is like really oh my god what's

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,490
happening there so this is really an

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,659
example for me always to have a peaceful

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,119
cooperation and not just corporate

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,860
collaboration we work together you don't

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,110
leave it to some politicians or to some

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,420
people who decide about our lives we

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,420
take lives in our hands and I'm very

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,360
happy to see this here yes what do you

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,340
think me too I'm very excited I've

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,079
always been a fan of Falls Asia

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,710
ever since I just went there four years

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,659
ago and I felt and I've always felt that

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,610
Thailand needs to be more involved in

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,890
the global free and open-source software

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,899
community and I think we have seen that

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,790
here today with with international

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,070
participants international speakers and

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,329
I saw we saw in the hall there was a lot

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,000
of talking a lot of collaborate

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,210
collaborate a lot of introductions being

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,060
made so I think in that regards is this

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,469
was a major success yeah so thank you

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,750
everyone for making the success and

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,800
let's have a small recap sure so what

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,270
what happened here so we had one two

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,250
three four five six

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,860
seven eight tracks with eight tracks

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,080
here and there was a breakout room we

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,030
had hands-on sessions there I saw today

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,950
a few people use it they had some

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,950
workshops there where the Python

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,690
workshop there and we had a lot of yeah

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,030
talks in the different tracks about

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,760
hardware what comes to your mind

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,930
for example which well which sessions

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,470
did you visit with what did you like oh

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,420
well

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,950
definitely I mean I am biased but I

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,870
definitely thought I found the the open

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,620
the E government stuff extremely

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:56,460
fascinating I also this morning attended

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,740
the session about the wax printers which

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,450
is really really cool as well mainly

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,560
because it's the problem that open

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,960
source is trying to solve it they had a

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,320
propriety wax printer it broke

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,050
no parts right so what happened decided

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,780
built his own it was like excellent love

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,890
that okay so and I think we can have

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,080
this session here a little bit

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,940
interactive so some other people have

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,740
some feedback for example I always know

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,080
andrew has feedback I already warned him

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,360
that I would ask him so and release from

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,700
Taiwan and like he's been also to a lot

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,610
of free no source conferences as a

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,890
Debian developer Andrew any feedback any

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,030
impressions that you like who did you

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,280
meet ice I think the best is saying it

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,810
as in happen that last night why we have

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,190
a light music and a capable care

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,680
together and then really talk to each

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,720
other I think that if we can put a such

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,730
kind of a social event a day and the

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,220
vast the the that the whole event the

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:54,270
first day even better the people where

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,370
you can know each other absolutely and

00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,200
we tried that we tried it we actually

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,580
had a few people but always depends

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,080
there's never enough time some people

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,959
arrive early some people arrive later

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,790
but we can expand on that yes as a

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,130
feedback thank you very much anyone else

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,720

asking him he's so tired so by the way

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,780

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,220
really great so the Open Text summit

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,730
2019 what do you think should we do it

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,380
again in 2019 it's a bit too soon isn't

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,900
it

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,510
I'm kidding probably or maybe we asked

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:58,190
this next year definitely okay so who

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,190
here wants to see open tech summit again

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,310

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,730
hey hey hey wonderful thank you so this

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,230
is great

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,570
should we continue with a bit more

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,100

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,840

continue to get your feedback what do

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,360
you think what do you like what do you

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,690
not like let's see how we can make it

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,880
better

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:25,740
oh here's poom sorry well perhaps we

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,930
could like publicizes a lot more

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,150
beforehand so we get more participants

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,710
because the idea of open source is a

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:36,300
very noble idea and to kind of like the

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,130
horns and make people know that there's

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,990
alternatives where you have to pay you

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,700
know for software to run their hardware

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,370
especially their older hardware

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,820
effectively is a great thing and of

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:50,280
course other noble causes like free

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,870
hardware as well as inaudible no free

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,490
designs for hardware or like even

00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:01,920
different forms of electronic governance

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:05,190
good governance and universal access to

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,480
whatever utilities for the 21st century

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:13,560
like you know internet access

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,350
environmental concerns future future

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,410
crucial points thinking points debate

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,050
open discussion it would be much more

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,460
richer with a bigger amount of people

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:28,380
joining you're welcome it sounds like a

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,930
huge event to me I don't know we can do

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,300
this but like three Norman sauce events

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,070
are not just like limited to this team I

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,770
think you can also take this as an

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,690
inspiration and do more dedicated events

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,370
and by the way is it ok also we can also

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,400
have if people are more comfortable to

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:48,350
speaking in Thai yes yes sorry we have a

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,350
boom here wanted to share something cool

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,410
so yeah I really like the event I'm a

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,510
volunteer and I just maybe next time we

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,680
I want to have more time for the

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,680
volunteers to prepare everything

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:10,519
but just I like the whole event it's

00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:12,319
very informative thank you

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:17,179

00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:21,619
the drones cool some more drones more

00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:22,429
time to prepare and more drones okay

00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:25,579
that's fine

00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:29,359

like on I saw yesterday how did you like

00:11:48,100 --> 00:12:01,300
the social event for example actually is

00:11:52,750 --> 00:12:04,750
a have don't have some of the of the

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:09,820
comment much yeah because I just one day

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:17,380
but actually is I think one of the thing

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:20,440
is a tie of the the we can do much more

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,470
public relations for the next time yeah

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,330
we just do for for the Facebook group

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:31,779
and coyote lab narrow yeah arrow Soto

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:37,210
for for the communication but I think is

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:40,990
a open tech submitters can be layer much

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,740
more fun bister if we can do hire a

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,300
project of the open sauce teaching the

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,810
project or some kinda like that is that

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:53,650
maybe another thing that I would like to

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,910
suggest yeah for the next half this is

00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:05,560
really great that you volunteer to

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:08,880

the next year yeah and also I said yeah

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:18,700
the thing that's that we can buy out the

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:21,250
most sponsorship for next year and I see

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,810
in eating this year from the 4-h a team

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,120

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:29,560
impression here of Thailand and the Open

Text summit how did things work out hi

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,970

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,600
for the first time but Thai people are

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:45,450
very friendly everything is good so I

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,890
have to come back next year very shy but

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,320
like you can talk with each other and

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,740
mr. Witter you're from the Singapore

actually second time in Thailand yeah

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,540
it's my first in the summit Open Text

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,370
I'm in escrow in Thailand so so far I

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,780
would say comparing okay

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,330
it's not good to compare but I would

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,370
like to compare now the crowd here is

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,270
quite receptive a competitor Singapore's

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:16,320
so very good can you elaborate on

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:19,500
receptive more active I would say yes

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,180
they are more open to it open source you

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,080
know I mean it's not singing up

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,690
Singaporeans are not but just at the way

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,840
how culture actually shapes different

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,970
mindsets yeah yeah actually I would

00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,320
enjoy enjoy coming here quite often

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,470
of course I will come back again next

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,840
year okay I will actually like to hear

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:46,410
from khun jump or because he is actually

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:50,120
a coffee farmer right so so how do you

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,120
like this event that's a good nine 1/2

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:18,300
Nokia lol potato plant bedroom bungalow

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:31,650
camera pen pen from Singh Palmer they

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:34,380
found me I am so I am so he said that we

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,600
we should be publicizing this event to

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,760
more than just just geeks we should be

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,470
probably we should be publicizing it in

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,570
the in the wider circle because he is

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,030
both he's coming from perspective both

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,890
as a former programmer

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,170
that's now a farmer and many other Tulsi

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,670
goes to and it just wowed him so he

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:56,350
wants other people to come here and get

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:56,350
the feeling of wellness as well Kapaa

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:11,500
I just I just want to say how enjoyable

00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:13,550
it's been and the relaxed fun atmosphere

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,990
it's very different to a lot of

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,480
conferences that I've been to or spoken

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,730
out the fact I think this is a great

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,340
venue number one came up so great choice

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,380
of venue and just the way it's been laid

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,760
out really well organized the volunteers

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,000
and these kids have been brilliant and

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,790
the fact that you've allowed families to

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,850
bring their kids it just shows how kind

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,510
of relaxed and informal the summer's

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,460
been and it's been very much like a

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,470
experiential and and I know that the

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,020
organizers like Mario neden they went

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,660
out socializing to all hours and that's

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,350
rare to have like when you've got

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,060
organizers and you know people going out

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,230
and socializing with the delegates and

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,880
with the speakers there's quite

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,760
extraordinary I think that kind of

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,760
spirit has made this summit really

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:05,630
enjoyable of me and I'd love to see it

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,280
come back as well one thing I would like

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,170
to see is when you go on the website and

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,670
you go onto the the different assets

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,020
you've got online maybe some of the

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,120
video is just posted up there from

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,130
previous events whether it's Vietnam or

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,320
Singapore is get some videos up there so

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,720
people can see the kind of content they

00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,060
might be able to see and view but yeah

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,610
thanks so much for organizing this it's

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,190
been great yeah actually that's a good

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,040
idea maybe even the speakers can post

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,020
send us links to previous talks so that

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,670
we can feature the previous what the

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,020
speakers has talked about in the past as

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,050
well that's that's a good that's a

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:42,410
pretty good idea well so you can send in

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,930
a pull request and add that feature yeah

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,700
so maybe many people don't know that yet

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:50,330
but actually all these website and so on

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,490

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,560
on the website you find a mistake or

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,180

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:08,520
of the organizers of the pike on in here

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,560
in Thailand present it's always

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,020
interesting to hear the experience of

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,830
other organizers and feedback and what

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,500
what went well for you for example here

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,750
yeah thanks very much sir I'm Mike and I

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,760
don't know I think quite a few of you

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:27,680
probably attended a Pike on this year I

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,960
was one of the organizers of that

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,780
and yeah this is a great event I like

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,850
this kind of size of event it's great to

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,620
see like it's very inclusive and you've

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:40,130
got a good age range here that's really

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,830
good I would say like as advice from

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,010
organized and icons like this this size

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:48,410
of event is really quite not too hard to

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,960
organize and this is also a great venue

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,440
we had one of the PI cons here as well

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,440
as you

00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:04,190
children children as you as you as you

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,340
grow the event you need more volunteers

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,440
I think like about 500 then you have to

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,520
start thinking about outsourcing some of

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,320
the work so that's my advice for like

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:19,160
growing this event but it's good to grow

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,180
and yeah if if people want to volunteer

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,310
for the next event

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,480
I recommend that it's good to be involve

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,550
with these kind of events it's a

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,440
community thing thank you and yeah maybe

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,000
Bella and if you pick from your side we

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,470
had the registration how did things work

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,470
out together with the Thai people

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,750
actually the good thing is everybody

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:45,080
thought I was Thai but I was not

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,270
actually well but I did very kind and I

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,110
love Thai people as well as Thai food

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:53,150
but even was actually such a great

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,930
experience to me so I hope I could come

00:21:53,150 --> 00:22:01,310
back next year thank you thank you and

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:04,100
you know anything to say this is the

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:06,860
first time I think I was attending one

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,900
of these conferences and something that

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,630
I think is probably the highlight is I

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,160
loved how kids were all around they were

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,590
organizing they were troubleshooting

00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,210
problems they were doing everything and

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,350
that itself like there's a there's so

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,460
much interest and that is something

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,050
which was fascinating

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,490
other than the talks it was a bummer

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,170
that I couldn't attend the first day but

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,090
hoping that I can continue and

00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:32,660
collaborate more with everyone around

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:34,970
thanks so much thank you so I think we

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,130
will send out a form after the event yes

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,840
because sometimes like some ideas or

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:45,250
like you need to in German we say some

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,890
things have to sink so yeah sink in or

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,390
something like that so and yeah we're

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,020
looking forward to your feedback and

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,659
this is an open team so um how we often

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,760
do things in for Asia events we have a

00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:58,900
core team they take care of some of the

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,279
logistics and so on

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,400
which is difficult to handle with

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:07,390
volunteers we have yeah everyone has a

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:10,390
life right but like community can do a

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,730
lot of fun things and yeah this is how

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,640
we want to continue this so the team is

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,350
generally open and future and how we do

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,340
this for example in Singapore the three

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:24,130
months before an event we have meetings

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,740
once a week or every two weeks and yeah

00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,419
if you're interested to be also not just

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,520
volunteer but like part of the

00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:32,830
organization team that's okay if you're

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,020
a speaker or any other role and it's

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:41,320
always great when we if we can connect

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:43,690
yes so that's it yes and yeah a lot of

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,090
more things are going on this is not the

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,919
end we hope you're also organized events

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,080
or meetups or something like that and

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,620
actually my observation in Thailand is

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,820
often that we have this crowd of like

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,860
expats getting together and then we have

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,960
this crowd of Thai people getting

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,809
together and I'm really happy that we

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,690
achieved to bring these two crowds here

00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,580
together and that I hope to see more in

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,679
future as well and actually it's a lot

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:12,610
because of you me sorry you're kind of a

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,860
connector of many worlds so um yeah I

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,440
would also like to say thank you to who

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,020

conversations to be had a lot more fun

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,380

collaborators or just enjoying each

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,420

come across fellow geeks who are into

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,560
open source so we want to make the most

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,320

with us so we can also share this with

the community I think a big feedback

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,520
here was that we have to share more

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,350
