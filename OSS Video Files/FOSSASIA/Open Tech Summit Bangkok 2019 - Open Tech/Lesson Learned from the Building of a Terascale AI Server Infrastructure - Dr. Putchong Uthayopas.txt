Description: 
	Dr. Putchong Uthayopas, Vice President for Information(CIO), Kasetsart University

Building an AI service Infrastructure for a large number of researchers is a challenging task due to the complexity of system architecture, hardware and software co-design which need to match the diverse requirement of advanced users. This talk will share some lesson learned from setting up the ARES ( AI Research and Education System) and Poseidon System at Kasetsart University. ARES system is a cluster of NVIDIA V100 GPU consists of 4 nodes servers connecting to a 100Gbps infrastructure. Poseidon is a DGX1 system consists of 8 V100GPU card that has a peak deep learning performance of 1
petaflop. The purpose of this system is to accelerate the deep learning and HPC research activities at Kasetsart University. The lesson learned from system design implementation will be present along with the challenges and solution used for both software and hardware. Currently, this system is up and running for a group of advanced users and will soon publicly open for services at Kasetsart University.
