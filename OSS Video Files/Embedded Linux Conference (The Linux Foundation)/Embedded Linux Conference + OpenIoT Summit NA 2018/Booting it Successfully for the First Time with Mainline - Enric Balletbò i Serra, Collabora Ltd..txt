Description: 
	Booting it Successfully for the First Time with Mainline - Enric Balletbò i Serra, Collabora Ltd.

 Things have gotten a lot better, and yet new hardware bring-up sometimes still feels like pulling teeth. With the right methodology, tools and techniques, a significant amount of time, energy and sanity can be saved while enabling a new board to run Linux. Enric Balletbo will discuss his process to tackle new board and the challenges they bring. The presentation will cover the steps from reviewing initial schematic design to the successful upstreaming of any necessary bootloader and kernel patches, and will provide some examples based on the latest board the speaker helped to make compatible with mainline.
