	Tutorial: Introduction to Reverse Engineering - Mike Anderson, The PTR Group, Inc.

Security is always a concern as our products ship, especially in today's world of cracking attempts. But, what enables the crackers to be able to break into systems? Oftentimes, the answer is that they reverse engineer your product. In this tutorial, we will examine the techniques used by the cracker to reverse engineer your hardware and your software. We will look at techniques to bypass physical security as well as repopulating connectors on motherboards, reading flash storage, accessing firmware updates and the software techniques used to find vulnerabilities in your code.
