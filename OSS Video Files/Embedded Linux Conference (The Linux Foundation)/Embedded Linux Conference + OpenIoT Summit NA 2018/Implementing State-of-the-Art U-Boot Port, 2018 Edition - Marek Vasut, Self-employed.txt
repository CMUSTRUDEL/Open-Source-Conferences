	Implementing State-of-the-Art U-Boot Port, 2018 Edition - Marek Vasut, Self-employed

This presentation is a practical guide to implementing U-Boot bootloader port to a new system from scratch. At the beginning, two main pillars of contemporary U-Boot, device tree (DT) support and driver model (DM), are explained. This is followed by an in-depth look at the crucial subsystems, clock, pinmux, serial, block and a few other commonly used ones. Finally, systems with limited resources and multi-stage booting is discussed. The talk includes examples and experiences from platforms recently added to mainline U-Boot. 

About Marek Vasut
I have been contractor for multiple companies for many years. My primary responsibility is designing and implementing customer specific functionality. One important aspect of my work is leveraging the benefits of working inside the mainline Linux, U-Boot and OE / Yocto Project, explaining our customers the benefits of pushing the newly produced code back into mainline and effectively doing the contributions. I am therefore heavily involved with both mainline U-Boot and Linux kernel, be it my role as R-Car, SoCFPGA or USB maintainer for U-Boot, MTD co-maintainer in Linux or others. My speaking experience includes giving talks at ELCE, LinuxCon Japan, EmbeddedWorld and various smaller events across Europe.
