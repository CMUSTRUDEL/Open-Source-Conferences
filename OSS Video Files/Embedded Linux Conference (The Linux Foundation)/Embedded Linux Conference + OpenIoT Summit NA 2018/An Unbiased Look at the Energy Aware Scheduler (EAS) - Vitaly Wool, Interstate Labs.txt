	An Unbiased Look at the Energy Aware Scheduler (EAS) - Vitaly Wool, Interstate Labs

The big.LITTLE ARM SoCs have recently become a primary choice for many consumer electronic devices requiring high computing capacity and aiming for lower power consumption at the same time. As big.LITTLE is a heterogeneous architecture it puts special requirements on the OS scheduler for efficient operation, and Linux's completely fair scheduler (CFS) is not a good match.

To make matters worse, there happened to be several competing implementations of a scheduler for big.LITTLE, and none of them ideal. The Linaro version, called Energy Aware Scheduler, however, has taken the lead and is now used in most Linux/Android powered devices, with some funky modifications from hardware vendors.

This talk will provide a description of the EAS essentials and how it compares to the alternatives, briefly cover its vendor variations and then concentrate on what's good and what's not so good in it.
