	Impact of Platform Firmware on Linux Kernel - Megha Dey & Sai Praneeth Prakhya, Intel

The ubiquity of Linux coupled with the de-facto UEFI platform firmware calls for rigorous validation of their interaction. A bug in either the kernel's EFI subsystem or firmware itself might cause systems to crash or hang; for instance, memory regions belonging to the operating system being illegally accessed by firmware. In this presentation, we would like to discuss the specific instances of firmware bugs that have impacted the stability of the operating system and some potential solutions that could have eliminated these bugs altogether. Also, we would like to introduce LUV(Linux UEFI Validation); a unified framework of several open-source test-suites packaged into a cohesive and easy-to-use product that aims to help firmware developers uncover bugs in the implementation of UEFI firmware at critical levels of the software stack. 

About Megha Dey
I am a software engineer working at Intel's OTC(Open Source Technology Center) for the last 2.5 years. I am involved in developing/optimizing software which enables new features/instructions specific to Intel processors on the mainline Linux kernel. I am also currently the maintainer of the LUV(Linux UEFI Validation) project which mainly validates the interoperability of UEFI firmware with Linux.
I have given a couple of talks at internal Intel conferences like firmware and validation summit.
