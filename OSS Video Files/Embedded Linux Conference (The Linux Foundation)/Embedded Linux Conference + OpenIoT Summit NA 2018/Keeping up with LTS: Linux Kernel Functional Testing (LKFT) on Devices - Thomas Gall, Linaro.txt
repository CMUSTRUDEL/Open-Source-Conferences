	Keeping up with LTS: Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT) on Devices - Thomas Gall, Linaro

Long Term Support (LTS) Linux kernels are great to use in devices because a continuous stream of fixes is available for an extended period of time. (2-6 years typically) The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) aggressively keeps up with LTS fixes for 4.4, 4.9 and 4.14.

The community has boot testing in kernelci, and x86 testing using zero-day, but there was a gap in testing on embedded devices. Our goal is to catch regressions as quickly as possible during the LTS RC test cycle, and increase confidence that consumer devices are able to upgrade to the latest LTS.

This talk will cover:
- Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT)
- Infrastructure in use
- Experiences with devices and complicated test suites
- Experiences with tracking LTS, triaging bugs and regressions, and communities that could benefit
- How to get involved
