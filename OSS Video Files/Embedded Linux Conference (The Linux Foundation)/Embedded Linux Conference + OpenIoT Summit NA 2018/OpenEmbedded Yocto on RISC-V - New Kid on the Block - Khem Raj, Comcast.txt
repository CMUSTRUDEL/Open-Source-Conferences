	OpenEmbedded/Yocto on RISC-V - New Kid on the Block - Khem Raj, Comcast

RISC-V a new open source ISA based architecture is rapidly gaining acceptance in embedded space. Several core packages e.g. gcc toolchain, linux kernel, binutils, newlib, qemu has already been ported for risc-v, At this point OpenEmbedded is one of first embedded linux distribution frameworks to support RISC-V architecture. This talk will cover the status of support as the core support has been upstreamed into OpenEmbedded-core, additionally SOC layer meta-riscv is also created which would serve as common layer for all RISC-V based SOCs.

While key infrastructures are being ported to support RISC-V, there are key challenges still there.

This talk would also introduce the status of various other important packages e.g. Qemu, glibc, which are essential for boot strapping a linux distribution on RISC-V and how OpenEmbedded is currently providing the support and gaps needed to be addressed
