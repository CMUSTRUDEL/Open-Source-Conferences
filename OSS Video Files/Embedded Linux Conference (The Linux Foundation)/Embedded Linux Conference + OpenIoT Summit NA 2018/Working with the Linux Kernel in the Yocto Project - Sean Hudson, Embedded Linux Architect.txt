Description: 
	Working with the Linux Kernel in the Yocto Project - Sean Hudson, Embedded Linux Architect

 The Yocto Project combines tools and metadata together to enable developers to create a customized Linux distribution from source. It eases the burden of carrying customizations across distribution upgrades and helps reduce the effort required to port across architectures. At the heart of any system is the kernel. This talk covers the tooling, the best practices and the work flows to create a custom kernel for their distribution. During the talk, we will explore the development cycle of creating a new kernel configuration and integrating it fully back into the platform. Along the way, we will cover several common tasks and provide pointers about where to get more help. This talk is geared for individuals who are familiar with building a customized Linux system and who are familiar with the Yocto Project.
