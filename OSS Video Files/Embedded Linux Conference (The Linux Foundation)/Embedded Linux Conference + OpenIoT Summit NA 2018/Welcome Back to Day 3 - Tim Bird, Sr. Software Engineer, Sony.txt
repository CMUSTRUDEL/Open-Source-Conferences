00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,719
night when we plan to do this again in

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,580
Portland I thought boy I hope there's

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,150
bacon and sure enough there was I got

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,160
plenty of bacon last night so I hope you

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,760
make fun we're doing something a little

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,140
bit different this year we'll see if

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,460

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,570
sideways but I'd like to actually go

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:41,390
