Description: 
	Bring-up with Netconsole and USB without a Serial Debug Net - Jason Kridner, Texas Instruments and BeagleBoard.org Foundation

 A serial debug console and even JTAG are often assumed for new board bring-up. This presentation will illustrate opportunities for bringing up some designs with neither a serial UART interface or JTAG when doing new bootloader and kernel development. This will include usage of Buildroot to do a complete build management. Utilization of bootloader provided debug resources to the kernel, such as EFI, will also be explored. Demonstration and reproduction materials will be provided on PocketBeagle boards using only a USB connection.
