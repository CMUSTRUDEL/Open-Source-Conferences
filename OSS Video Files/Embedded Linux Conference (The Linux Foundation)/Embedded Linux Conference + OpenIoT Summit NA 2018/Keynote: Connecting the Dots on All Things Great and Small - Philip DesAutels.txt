Description: 
	Keynote: Connecting the Dots on All Things Great and Small - Philip DesAutels, Sr. Director of IoT, The Linux Foundation

The complexity of architectures across all domains of the Internet of Things has grown with the increasing richness of the underlying connected products and services. The basic models of device and cloud have given way to new models that integrate device, edge, network, and cloud. Various open source projects have formed to fill the gaps in the story and as a result, we are starting to see the emergence of a cohesive system of interconnected open source components needed for this to happen. In this session, Kate and Philip will take you through the Linux Foundation's open IoT strategy to help you understand how it all fits together.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,589
so I was supposed to be talking here

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,450
with Kate and Chris Chris has been

00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:12,870
indeterminately delayed because of

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:21,779
weather and Kate has the plague from the

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:30,119
last two conferences she was at so there

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:32,009
we go and then there was one a little

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,960
background on Kate Chris and myself to

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,510
help set up the talk because the the

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,700
combination would have would have made

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,550
more sense with the title I've been

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,770
focusing on the edge of IOT specifically

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,500
the the gateway part of the edge of IOT

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,510
kate has been leading Zephyr among the

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,879
many other things she does at the Linux

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,239
Foundation so she's really working on

00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,960
the tiny little bits at the very far

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,799
edge of the IOT and Chris is with cloud

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:09,240
native and he is the cloud side of the

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,460
story and so really you know this idea

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,380
of all things great and small is to put

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,310
in place this this story of where we're

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,409
heading with the Internet of Things and

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,600
you know I I'm sticking up a bunch of

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,670
marketing slides if you if you search

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,110
there's an amazingly good set and I'm

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,380
sorry these are small and mostly

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,270
unreadable but the the net net here is

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,450
these are the pictures that are starting

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,939
to be drawn around IOT and deployment

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,369
now and I try I've tracked these for

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,439
seven or eight years and I have a whole

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,689
collection of these and the style of the

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,610
pictures of how this all works has

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,649
really changed over that time the

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,020
concepts and the understanding of it

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,119
have really changed and now we're seeing

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,829
this rich picture that kind of looks

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,280
like this where things are going all the

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,390
way up and talking to the cloud but

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,880
they're going a little beyond that and

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,140
hopefully in this talk we'll get to get

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,459
to that I'm kind of preaching to the

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,870
choir here so I won't spend a lot of

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,600
time on this but you know there's a

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,880
really

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,290
a perfect storm of things going on

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,970
censors getting really cheap compute

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,780
getting really cheap storage getting

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,300
really cheap all of this great

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,730
connectivity happening lots of different

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,010
protocols out there now

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,660
and I think really importantly and to

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,140
talk yesterday you know manufacturing

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,670
and the supply chain is really magic the

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,700
supply chain is magic because you can

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,380
design a board now for a project push a

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,080
button and three days later have the

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,880
board come and at the same time three

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,500
days later have the plastic case come

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,950
from somebody else who did the plastic

00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,370
case for you and so the part of building

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:04,290
the IOT components is getting really

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,670
really good and really really easy to do

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,950
we're also seeing and again as

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,080
yesterday's talk was unplanned from the

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,730
keynote yesterday but hardware function

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,130
moving into software we're seeing lots

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,080
of that and I'm smiling Massimo's down

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:21,460
here you know a Arduino helped a lot of

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,350
people understand that pattern

00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,330
especially really early on in this that

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,390
you could do a lot in software to make

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:31,540
things far more flexible and they seemed

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,340
and so we're starting to see a lot of

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,320
functionality move into software so this

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,840
supply chain of components plus the

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:42,850
software is really making the deployment

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,200
of IOT real now and I'm seeing lots of

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,920
it in the field I'm seeing lots of it

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,960
from a wide range of companies this is

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,130
where Chris Hanna check jumps in hi I'm

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,230
Chris the cloud is eating the world you

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,440
know I don't even have to jump into it

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,780
too far I think this one is really an

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,670
awesome talk about kubernetes and the

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,950
impact of cloud and these cloud models

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,390
that are emerging and really I shouldn't

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,570
say emerging they've emerged that they

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,450
are the norm now you know the kubernetes

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,220
supported by top 10 cloud providers in

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,810
the world and it's one of the fastest

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,000
current projects why is that because it

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,680
solves a really important problem it

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,240
makes it easy to build and deploy this

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,280
stuff because we have all of these

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,320
little things and because we have

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,760
this cloud the amount of data is rising

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,930
and to be talked a lot about this

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:41,350
yesterday which is leading to

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:44,980
opportunity and challenges and we're

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,880
starting to see this again like Anthony

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,020
talked about yesterday

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,050
this web scale coming to the masses

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,120
Anthony talked about some services

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,850
there's a variety of services now that

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,310
if you've done your little board design

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,560
and you've had your plastic made you can

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,990
pretty quickly get the rest of that

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,580
story together with a few notable

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:12,750
exceptions it's all not that hard at the

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,100
same time we have this trend going on

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,380
that I think we're to hear from the

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,320
other keynote speakers today and you're

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,960
all here at Linux Foundation event

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,900
around close to open ecosystems and I

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,220
was really careful with the with the

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,410
point here and you know this is

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,950
something Chris talks really eloquently

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,020
about that open ecosystems not just open

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,910
source software but open ecosystems and

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,870
the recursive nature of those open

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,950
ecosystems to power things since I'm the

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,810
edge guy and now I'm going to talk about

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:48,970
the edge and really jump into the part

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:51,010
that I think is interesting the edge is

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,140
real four years ago when we started this

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,810
event we were talking about the edge and

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,330
we had some some examples but we didn't

00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,740
have a lot of them now every single

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,479
product company I talked to that's

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,580
building a product has a very competent

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,680
edge story to go along with that product

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,840
sometimes it's in the device sometimes

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,250
it's around the device with gateways but

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,020
the edge story is getting really

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,729
powerful and the scale of it you know I

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,360
think this one's interesting because it

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:18,789
was 2014 and it was kind of a look if

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,460
you look at the numbers from 2017 that's

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,890
effectively a hundred percent it just

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,500
the products have an edge strategy

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:31,660
they've encompassed edge and the scale

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:35,229
of dollars in edge computing is really

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,840
starting to grow to the point of you

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,250
know the cloud side and why is this

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,600
because when you can build a lot of

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,330
little things and you can make them

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,340
sheep you really can't have them all

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,130
talking to the cloud because the numbers

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,170
get really big this is my favorite stat

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,730
from last year the number of connected

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,860
things exceeded the number of connected

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,680
phones this is actually a really big

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,350
milestone so now we have 2x the number

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,970
of humans of you know connected things

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:05,940
on the planet if you had the phones and

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:11,680
the devices and this goes to the the

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:18,930
goes to the story of really the the

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:22,570
scale of it growing up in this space

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,700
we've seen and just talking to folks

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,180
here who've been doing this for a long

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,220
time in a connected world and just

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,420
didn't even think about the slide we're

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:36,490
talking earlier but MTM world has been

00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,640
doing this for a long time you know the

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,100
the MTM world has spent a lot of time

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,910
because they have big money items

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,530
building and connecting things

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,810
collecting data processing that data and

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,210
transforming their businesses but what's

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,560
really interesting and the edge data and

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,390
the number of connected things shows it

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,570
is the size of the market that's growing

00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,850
to go along with that now the m2m folks

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,170
set the stage but when you have a five

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,490
million dollar machine you can spend a

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,190
lot of money to connect to five million

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,990
dollar machine to manage it but when you

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,110
have a two or three dollar sensor

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,790
you really can't spend the same money or

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,230
take the same actions to make that

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,160
connectivity but you want the same

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:20,260
effect and the this slide is really

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,450
starting to talk to where people are

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,970
starting to see the dollars in it two

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,220
years ago three years ago these slides

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,110
just had big random numbers on them they

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,630
said you know the number is going to be

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,039
a trillion billion million dollars now

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,450
that these numbers are starting to get

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,340
ranges and they're starting to tighten

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,080
in because people are starting to figure

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,080
out exactly where this all fits together

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,360
there's a phrase I love tracking these

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,430
digital transformation slides these have

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,560
been around for about 20 years they

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,940
tracked every single digital trend

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
possible there was digital

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,340
transformation for client server and

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,900
then digital tray

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,610
formation for web and the digital

00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,480
transformation for mobile and now it's

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,580
about IOT but the important part here is

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,200
when these new technologies come in and

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,680
into the opening when they get

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,440
inexpensive and they get widely deployed

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:16,470
they appear in all kinds of places and

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,470
they affect the way businesses work the

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,290
this is a company of a Linux Foundation

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,090
member one of their customers and this

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,430
is a really interesting company this is

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,190
the trend that I have been tracking the

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,600
most and the piece of IOT and edge that

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,650
I find so fascinating

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,820
ATF Australian temporary fencing company

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:41,080
they literally sell fencing to job sites

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,980
they generally don't look as pretty as a

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:49,890
nice green field but they sell job site

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:52,450
protection their business is now gonna

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,360
this is in one year their business is

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,120
now going to have as much revenue from

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,720
this job site surveillance technology

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,250
that they developed last year so in 2018

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,150
they'll make as much money from the job

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,530
site technology job site security

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,610
technology as they will from all of

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,550
their physical world

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,140
fencing business they completely

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,700
transform what their business is they

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,110
already had a relationship with the

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,230
customer they already had a connection

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,120
to the field and now they're just

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,560
delivering a new product it's got an

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,180
edge computer in it those facial

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,190
recognition it does image recognition

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,140
it's all kinds of really great stuff and

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,720
because they're put in really terrible

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,030
places all over Australia that away at

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,870
the edge of the connectivity network it

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,370
uses Sig Fox Laura technology to send

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,290
little messages to say that there's a

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,450
problem so they have actually pushed all

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,500
of the smarts to the edge in a mostly

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,790
disconnected world

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,860
another example is Stern if you use a

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,160
bathroom tap here and you put your hands

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,690
underneath it it comes on what's one of

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,540
the big challenges with being a place

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,640
like this with bathrooms there's a lot

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,200
of them and some of them are gonna be

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,310
used today and some of them are going to

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,080
be used today it's something we're gonna

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,960
be used a lot like when this session is

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,940
over

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,320
and other ones hidden around the

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,770
building around the corner are gonna be

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,780
used a lot less but if you're a regular

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,310
hotel restaurant Airport you have to

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,530
check those bathrooms over and over

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,890
again every 45 minutes you send your

00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:25,160
custodial staff to them Stern connected

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,780
up these faucets and now a big part of

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,210
their business and the most growing part

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,830
of their business is analytics reports

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,300
for the janitorial staff to tell them

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,160
which bathrooms they have to attend to

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,560
and when and which ones they can choose

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,200
to ignore it also predicts things like

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,120
paper towel usage and soap usage so that

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,250
you're not wasting time trigger opening

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,670
up the dispensers because they've built

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:49,370
these really big models these examples

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,930
really fit into this you know you

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,070
couldn't do this before caterpillar

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,530
could do it but you couldn't do this

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,300
before but now stern and what is a very

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,400
inexpensive tap that there's hundreds of

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,310
in a building like a facility like this

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,040
can now do that put informatics around

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,750
they have an edge computer that does all

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,200
the calculations and then pull that data

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,090
up to the building another example of

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,650
this transformation that I love right

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,460
the technology has now gotten to the

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:18,050
point where it works at the beginning I

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,090
showed Chris's slides and talked a

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,810
little bit about the cloud picture what

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:25,400
we're seeing and Patricia just jumped

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,370
over which is great - Patricia and I

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,930
have talked a bunch about this we're

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,270
seeing this model we know how to build

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,480
stuff on the cloud side and we're now

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,250
getting to the point where we need to

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,890
build stuff on the edge we have real

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,380
edge computers Dells get a really

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,880
beautiful $300 industrial edge computer

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,890
there's you know smaller ones if you and

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,930
these routers there's bigger ones it's a

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,150
wide range of them opto 22 is upstairs

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,730
with industrial edge computers we know

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,110
how to put computers at the edge and now

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,720
we're starting to build the models

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,100
around what to do with those computers

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
and how to make those little sensors and

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,470
those little computers work and some of

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,030
the pioneers like ATF or stern are

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,710
starting to set the models but as

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,630
they're developing and as you talk to

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,100
them they're asking for it to get a lot

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,570
easier they're asking for the same

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,670
things their developers see on the

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,410
website to happen on the edge side to

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,480
happen in the world of things especially

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,940
in these enterprise

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,250
industrial use cases and so what we're

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,490
seeing is the same model for the cloud

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,060
being flipped 100% over onto the edge

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,519
side

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,290
the scale of a scale of it is slightly

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,149
different but the model is still the

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,100
same I have servers and containers and

00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,410
distribution and I have load balancing

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,630
and I need all of the network and things

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,370
at the edge that I do on the cloud side

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:45,399
and then in between them and so we're

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:46,750
seeing this mirroring of models at the

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,639
same time we're seeing that we're seeing

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,529
this big challenge around security right

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,570
because this number is increasing it as

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:58,300
this number is increasing I put my hack

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,250
up here as the number increases

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,500
companies like start an ATF actually

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,839
start to really worry about I have to

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,160
faucet taps that hurt in bathrooms and

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,320
now I have to worry about is my faucet

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
tap gonna be hacked and if it's gonna be

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,380
hacked is it going to cause a vector

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,620
into the hotel or is it just gonna flood

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,329
the bathroom or something else it seems

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,519
like a trivial problem but if you're a

00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:22,149
faucet company you need all of this

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,079
security and so in my job of being out

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:27,279
there in the field talking to talking to

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,430
lots of these companies deploying

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,550
products they've asked over over again

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,610
for help putting this out there and so

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:39,459
inside of the Linux Foundation which

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,230
started to work really hard to curate an

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,779
architecture and emerging open-source

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,180
architecture that puts together a set of

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,649
pieces to make this a lot easier it

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,510
isn't all of the pieces and there's a

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,250
lot more to go on here I left some blue

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,540
boxes with dot dot dots because we have

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,639
some announcements coming up in the very

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,980
near future on some additional projects

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,920
that fit in here but you know on the

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,350
left side of the screen we have Zephyr

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,319
for building tiny devices and we have V

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,399
octo for building bigger devices floors

00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:11,649
Tracey Tracey big plug for octo edge X

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,899
foundry for building edge computers have

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,510
a lot of members here in the audience of

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,550
the project lineage Linux Foundation

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,010
networking for connecting all of that

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,930
edge magic to your cloud magic in a safe

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,579
and secure way and then on the cloud

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,149
side besides kubernetes and all the

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:29,000
goodness out of CNC F we have a cue MOS

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:31,640
and

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,950
I project and are and ways to start

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,360
processing that data on the cloud side

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,650
and we're gonna see that migrate over to

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:47,050
the edge side too so Zephyr edge X Y

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:50,390
octo Linux Foundation networking and

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,100
kubernetes and cloud native I just

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,800
popped through them all because you can

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,590
go and see them all on the LF website

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,260
but I think this idea of curating a set

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,210
of technologies on this side like CN CF

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,240
has done really well on the cloud side

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,940
is really important to the emergence of

00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,100
IOT is a real thing because if we don't

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,890
do this we can't deploy it and the

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,170
customers can't deploy it know when you

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,150
talk to people you know four years ago I

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,980
remember lino stood up on stage and said

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,510
you know there's only 300,000 embedded

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,680
software developers in the world how

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,450
we're gonna make this work we're gonna

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,130
make this work by scaling by giving

00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,570
people patterns there weren't a lot of

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,790
web developers at the beginning either

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,580
and we scaled up that model pretty

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:37,240
quickly it's all starting to come

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:42,020
together and work really well but the

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,910
the thing that I think we need to be

00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,589
really careful of and you know I asked

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,780
from everybody in the room is working on

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,700
projects is your help pushing these

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,380
projects along to bring them to the

00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,000
point where they can deliver this value

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,920
we know how the cloud works it works

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,570
really well we have a really good model

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,670
there and the IOT it's still really

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:03,380
emergent and we're still trying really

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,670
hard to get that model to to get to the

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,770
point of having an architecture that's

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,380
robust enough to look like the diagrams

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,120

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,770
gonna stop there I'd love to talk to

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,050
anybody about this and what their

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,140
interests are afterwards I'll be hanging

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,140
