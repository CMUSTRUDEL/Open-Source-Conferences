Description: 
	Linux on Quick Turnaround Projects at Ball: No, We Aren’t Putting Linux in Canning Jars - Sam Povilus, Ball Aerospace

 Modern phased array antennas need a multitude of computers to control various aspect of their operation from steering to cooling. The Linux ecosystem’s broad base allows operational code to be maintainable and understandable as compared to the alternative, custom code written on bare metal or a proprietary RTOS. Sam Povilus will give an overview of how Ball Aerospace used Linux running on Xilinx Zynq FPGA’s to control and monitor an antenna. He will focus on the aspects of making Linux work with an FPGA, as well as how various hardware and software decisions were reached and how those decisions affected aspects of integration with hardware, and maintenance. 

About Sam Povilus
Sam Povilus has worked at Ball Aerospace for the past five years on everything from bare metal software to multi-computer distributed processing environments. He has used Linux for 15 years with the last three dedicated to embedded contexts. He is currently working on a simulator on the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite for the JPSS-2 spacecraft and spends his free time trying to get others to use Linux wherever they can.
