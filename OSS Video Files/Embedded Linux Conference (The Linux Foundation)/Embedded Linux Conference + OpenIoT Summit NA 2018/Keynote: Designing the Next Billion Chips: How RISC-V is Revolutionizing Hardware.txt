	Keynote: Designing the Next Billion Chips: How RISC-V is Revolutionizing Hardware - Yunsup Lee, Co-Founder and CTO, SiFive

Open source has revolutionized software. Now it's hardware's turn. In this talk, I present the chip design economics for today, introduce the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture, and talk about how RISC-V, open-source hardware, and SiFive are changing the chip design economics for the next billion chips that are being built for IoT, edge computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications.
