it's really excited to be here you know

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:09,660
I started using Linux when I was in

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:11,250
after graduation in 2003 and it's really

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,820
cool to be here to talk about risk five

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,180
so I'm today I'm going to give you some

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,890
insight about the chip design economics

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,310
because as being software people

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,840
sometimes really hard to grasp how bad

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,240
the hardware industry is so I'm gonna

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,670
you know do a bit of a rant about that

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,009
and then talk about why that doesn't

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,770
work for the future and then talk about

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,660
how risk five is revolutionizing the

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,700
hardware industry so let's dive right

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,670
into it can you put the slides on please

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,430
yes thank you

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,890
so I'm truly amazed how fast the IOT

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,170
edge computing machine learning field is

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,480
changing as a matter of fact to support

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,859
the computing needs of these growing

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,719
markets we must customize not only the

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,960
software but also the hardware as well

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,390
because general-purpose hardware or

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,100
chips will not deliver the performance

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,450
that you need for these growing

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,280
applications so the alternative future

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,810
that I kind of envision is that there's

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,270
going to be lots and lots of different

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,390
custom chips rather than having just a

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,920
couple high-volume general-purpose chips

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,009
however the current chip design

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,200
economics are not meant for building

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,770
lots of custom chips they're really

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,390
geared towards building general-purpose

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,950
high-volume chips so what does that even

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,630
mean so look at the graph on the right

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,040
it is known that to build a modern chip

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,649
microprocessor in a 28 nanometer process

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,350
technology note it will take more than

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,689
hundred millions of dollars and that's

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,880
why less and less and people less and

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,790
less people can actually afford building

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,790
these chips and it takes a long time to

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,579
actually actually put your product to

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,640
market so we talked about deploying in a

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,100
week it's earth-shattering hardware to

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,860
build a chip in eighteen months that's

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,690
that's considered earth-shattering so to

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,280
really make that formula work what

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,290
people do is spend a lot of money and

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,770
have to sell a lot of those chips to

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,900
make the

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,030
genomics work and obviously as you can

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,400
see that doesn't really work well for

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,290
custom chips because just inherently

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,600
you're not gonna sell that menu that

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,160
many volumes of those chips because you

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,470
know you're gonna build your custom chip

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,360
for for just your application you might

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,750
have small volume you might have medium

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,270
volume so so in order to really change

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,830
the chip design economics to work for

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,590
building lots and lots of different

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,070
custom chips I'm proposing that the

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,310
hardware industry needs to copy the

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,590
success of the software industry so to

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,030
make my point a bit more dramatic I'm

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,030
going to ask you a rhetorical question

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,940
how did Instagram turn into a billion

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,800
dollar company with only 13 employees do

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,380
you get that that's about 80 million

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,380
dollars worth of value per per engineer

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,040
conversely have you ever heard of a

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,810
billion dollar hardware chip company

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,230
with 13 employees probably not so let's

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,270
think about why by answering why I can

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,959
hopefully give you some intuition on how

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,440
we ought to change the hardware industry

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,910
so I got the tech stack of Instagram as

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,500
a matter of fact I googled it people

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,050
share these text sacks in the software

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,240
world it's kind of you know not heard of

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,280
in the hardware industry so there's two

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,440
things why I think Instagram worked with

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,590
13 employees to build a billion dollars

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,240
worth of value first they use a bunch of

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,000
open-source technology as you can see

00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,040
here that means that they put the 13

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,680
engineers working on the Instagram stack

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,360
not on building the the ground of

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,130
Technology and reinventing the wheel

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,040
like operating systems and compilers

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,200
they put those 13 engineers to work on

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,480
the part that mattered to them the value

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,360
added part which in this case it was the

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,840
application logic to take photos and

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,250
share them and married that with the

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,380
cloud infrastructure the easy-to-use

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,980
cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,600
Services route 53 cloud freud's s3

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,970
obviously something like Google Cloud as

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,930
well but you know to deploy their

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,410
application at scale to touch millions

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,790
of users

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,140
and to test out whether they had a

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:34,750
market product fit so compare that to a

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,910
typical hardware chip companies text at

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,640
can you think of any open-source

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,260
technology can you think of any kind of

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,390
cloud infrastructure to deploy the

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,810
hardware technologies at scale in this

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:50,530
case that means to build a chip write

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,410
anything oh yes

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,290
Emacs is very important yes to build

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,150
chips yes Auto very log and all that so

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm here to report that we've been

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,710
making a lot of progress here so there's

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,230
risk v it's a free and open instruction

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,000
set architecture which I'll talk about

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,190
also companies like Nvidia has started

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,100
to open-source their hardware technology

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,420
so they recently open-source dla the

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,630
deep learning accelerator is an

00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,720
inference engine and today I'm going to

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,030
talk about sci-fi cloud services which

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,460
is a cloud infrastructure to deploy your

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,770
hardware technology at scale in this

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,100
case we are going to help you build your

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:35,560
own custom chip very fast at affordable

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:38,830
price so what is RIS 5i I'm compelled to

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,340
ask how many people know verse five Wow

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,530
okay great so risk 5 is a high quality

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,840
license free royalty free instruction

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,180
set architecture so professor Dave

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,220
Patterson at Berkley has started four

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,870
risk projects in the 1980s you can see

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,940
all the chips on the below risk one

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,130
wrist to wrist through wrist for wrist

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,500
five is a fifth-generation wrist design

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,180
from UC Berkeley I started the wrist

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,700
fight project when as a grad student at

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,560
Berkeley in 2010 alongside my colleague

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,240
and friend Andrew Waterman and our

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,850
advisors Christmas on ovitch and Dave

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,860
Patterson wrist five is appropriate for

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,660
all levels of computing that means from

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,020
your smallest microcontrollers to your

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,390
embedded Linux device all the way to the

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,310
supercomputer HPC machines RIS five is

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,890
experiencing a rapid uptake in both

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,480
industry and academia and it is

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,000
supported by a growing software

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,080
ecosystem service 5 support for GCC

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,930
binutils

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,700
new lib GFC zephyr Linux FreeBSD has all

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,419
been upstream thanked thanks to your

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:40,600
support and we started a non-profit risk

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:44,450
v foundation to maintain the standard

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,820
and now we are at more than hundred

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,770
members so if you see your company's

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,290
logo here thank you very much for your

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,750
support if your company logo is not here

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,550
well you're missing out big time so I go

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,169
back and I kind of talk about you know

00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,700
to join the respect foundation to see

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,480
what's going on so thank you for your

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,820
support a quick note on Nvidia's effort

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,700
to open-source their machine learning

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,290
inference engine so you see Jenson Huang

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,720
CEO of Nvidia at the stage at last

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,090
year's GTC is proudly announcing the

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,520
xaviar dla that it's going to be open

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,440
source this ela engine actually has been

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,410
taped out in one of the Tegra chips that

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,080
Nvidia built so you know what is ela

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,210
it's a deep learning inference

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,700
accelerator for IOT markets it's

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,180
scalable highly configurable and it

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,620
supports a wide range of IOT devices so

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,660
kudos to Nvidia thanks for doing this

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,919
and I would love to see more companies

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:43,130
joining the open source hardware

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:45,110
revolution so I'm gonna switch gears and

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,370
talk a little bit about the size 5

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,680
chip design services so in order to

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,680
really deploy your hardware idea at

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,590
scale you need to put that in a piece of

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,610
silicon or a chip and have that have

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,979
that built so what is size 5 trip design

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,760
services it's a cloud infrastructure to

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,919
change the chip design experience to to

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,740
replicate that in a form of a website

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,450
click or an API calls just like how you

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,550
would bring up your virtual data center

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,160
today you would not go by machines you

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,169
would not go by networking gear just sit

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,360
and call some API is to call your own

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,250
virtual data center so similar to that

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,930
we are building this cloud

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,910
infrastructure to support chip building

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,010
so how does it work so you log into the

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,250
website on the on the upper right and

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,200
then you pick a template for each other

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,969
so today we have two templates for

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,560
building your own chip the first

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,810
template is called freedom everywhere

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,630
it's a low-power 32 bit microcontroller

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,370
it's manufactured in tsmc hundred 80

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,580
nanometer and it's good for IOT

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,900
applications the second template is

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,610
called Freedom Unleashed it's a

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,420
high-performance 64-bit multi-core

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,550
platform

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,960
it's manufactured in TSM VS 28 nanometer

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,150
so it supports your coherent

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,980
accelerators and we have already on

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,860
board all the important peripherals such

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,630
as PCIe DDR and Gigabit Ethernet so the

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,880
idea is that you don't need to work on

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,440
onboarding all these important IPS onto

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,050
the platform we've already done the work

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,030
to do that so I envision that this

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,640
platform will be good for embedded Linux

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,310
applications so after you selected these

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,230
templates then you can go on to a

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,470
marketplace where all the third-party

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,380
IPs have already been imported to our

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,570
project templates so today we have IPS

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,970
from Rambis ultra sock Flex Logic II

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,880
memory analog baits and things silicon

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,590
and they've already been boarded onto

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,100
our platform so they will be available

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:42,050
on the website and on top of that you

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,540
can go and on board additional

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,610
open-source Hardware IPS as well as your

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,040
your piece that matters to you your

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,620
customer IP which is the value-added

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,770
piece that you build and then after a

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,140
couple what you know clicks away from

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:00,500
the website or API calls away then

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,860
you'll get your own custom chip billions

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,200
of them just for your need so in other

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,270
words we're trying to change the chip

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,340
design experience into something like

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,560
ordering pizza online actually go to

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,960
dominos comm you put in your address and

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,670
then you pick a store and then it turns

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,040
out you can start building a pizza from

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,810
scratch or there's the so called

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,820
specialty pizzas which in my opinion

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,250
that there are templated designs for

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,560
your pizza and then after that you pick

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,090
your toppings and you click the order

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,800
button you don't talk to if you don't

00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,100
talk to people and you get this progress

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,040
bar says you know preparation baking

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,770
boxing and then delivery so think of

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,980
that chip design will be something like

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,630
that

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,620
the only difference is that chips will

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,660
be a bit more expensive than pizza so ok

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,250
let's dive in let's look at the freedom

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,230
everywhere platform it's a 32 bit

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,960
low-power microcontroller platform on

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,540
the left you can see the block diagram

00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,800
with the platform at the heart there is

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,310
the sci-fi V 31 CPU which runs at 320

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
megahertz

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,840
we support multiple power domains so

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,160
that we you can have your low power

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,350
standby mode

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,290
and the platform will also accept a wide

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,360
range of clock inputs so to demonstrate

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,040
the platform we've actually taken the

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,680
platform ourselves and we taped it out

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,110
on TSM 380 nanometer and that's the chip

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,300
on on on your right that's the freedom

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,790
everywhere a310 or the Fe 310 chip

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:30,470
manufacturers in TSMC 180 nanometer and

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:33,379
it's has a qf n 48 package so the idea

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,930
is that take the platform look at it and

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,449
add or subtract the features that you

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,120
need or you don't need and also you can

00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:43,850
come with your own app own piece of the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,350
hardware just put just plop that in and

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,449
tell us a couple

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,610
button clicks away and you get your own

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:56,360
microcontroller just for just built for

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:58,879
application so a quick performance and

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,379
power comparison for the fe 3 10 chip so

00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,089
we took three additional

00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,519
microcontrollers that were built in the

00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:06,860
same process technology no tsmc 180

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,019
nanometer and we did the comparison so

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,420
if you look at the Intel Curie model

00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:15,199
module it runs the top speed of the CPU

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,839
is 32 megahertz and all the other arm

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,720
cortex based microcontrollers have a top

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,329
speed of forty eight or 16 nanometer 16

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,310
megahertz compared that to our Fe 310

00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:27,980
chip which runs at a maximum speed of

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,290
320 megahertz so we are 10x faster than

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,449
Intel and elect the level it X more

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,329
performance than arm you know we also

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,100
measured the power it's 9 X more power

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,839
efficient than Intel and 2x more power

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:45,079
efficient Denar so it's a pretty good

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:47,720
platform so we also put together high

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,180
five one an Arduino compatible versified

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,819
development board which has our v3 10

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,370
chip here we've sold a thousand copies

00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:57,079
to more than 45 countries today if you

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,439
want your own you can go to crowd supply

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:03,050
calm its $59 you can order it right away

00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,430
today so jumping onto the second

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,470
template which is the freedom Unleashed

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,600
template which is a 64 multi-core

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,519
versatile Linux platform if you look at

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,860
the block diagram on the left you can

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,189
see at the heart that there's a u54 mcs

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,790
i5 CPU which runs at more you know 1.5

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,490
gigahertz

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,870
it has four application cores which are

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,360
linux capable and one

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,750
vedat core for housekeeping of the of

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,730
the of the chip we also have a chip to

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,740
chip coherent link coming out of the

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,650
coming out of the platform which which

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,930
we call chip link platform also has ddr3

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,500
and four Gigabit Ethernet and bunch of

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,960
peripherals

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,610
similarly we took the platform to

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,160
demonstrate that it actually works we

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,410
took the platform and we we we actually

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,140
built a chip you see that on the right

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,170
that's the freedom unleash 540 or the fu

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:55,730
540 comes in a flip chip BGA package and

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,290
it's also manufactured in TSM c28 we put

00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,760
together hi-5 unleash which is the

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,410
world's first multi-core wrist five

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,960
Linux development board which features

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,620
fu 540 as eight comes with eight

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,080
gigabytes of ddr4 memory with ECC

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,029
Gigabit Ethernet port spy flash micro SD

00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,120
card and also micro USB for debugging

00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,980
and serial communications also has an FM

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,750
C connector for future expansion so if

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,400
you want to connect a PCI or USB there

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,620
would be an expansion IO board with a

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,870
South Bridge on it the early access

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,260
units for March has all been sold out if

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,150
you want it at June you can go order

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,740
your own high five unleash board at

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:35,300
crowd supply calm for $999 we have a

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,980
bunch of software working on these

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,950
platforms thanks you thanks to your

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,020
support respire support for binutils GCC

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,390
new live GFC has all been up streamed

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,730
verse 5 support for operating systems

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,130
such as Zephyr Linux FreeBSD has all

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,800
been up streamed verse 5 emulator ports

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,510
for qmu has been up streamed however

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,790
there's still some missing pieces which

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm asking for your help there's missing

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,400
support for G Lipsey 32-bit also missing

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,860
some Linux drivers as a matter of fact I

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,570
have been told today that there are more

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,540
projects that have already been upstream

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,370
this list is growing everyday and the

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,830
risk 5 distribution ports are also in

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,440
progress debian fedora openembedded

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,450
open wrt gen 2 are all in progress to

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,310
have risk 5 support as a matter of fact

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,209
there's a talk today at 3 p.m. about res

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,100
5 openembedded

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:25,010
by kim raj so if you're interested I

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,080
urge you to go to his talk and I have to

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,390
do a quick shout out for everyone who's

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,940
been helping us out this has truly been

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,860
a big effort people at sci-fi Berkeley

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Red Hat blue speck Andes thanks thanks

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,950
for your help and we look

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,670
forward to getting more help porting

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,290
with software to risk 5 so I'm assuming

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,990
by now you're all excited about risk 5

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,720
so we're how do you get started so we're

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,540
super excited to have you experience for

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,090
us 5 at this at this conference today

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,890
tomorrow and the day after so we brought

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,390
a bunch of high fly one boards and high

00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,240
five unleash boards and we're gonna

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,680
throw a risk 5 hackathon so it's going

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,690
throughout the entire three days of the

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,190
conference it's at the 23rd floor of

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,100
this hotel

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,650
it starts 10:30 a.m. every day so after

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,900
today it's gonna happen after all the

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,290
keynote sessions this morning so we have

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,390
three challenges and the the prize for

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,490
each challenge is you get to have a high

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,980
five unleashed board and $2,000 of cash

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm just going to point out that nobody

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,210
has gotten in high five unless board

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,590
because we haven't shipped it so you'll

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,200
be one of the first people to have the

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:33,260
high five only sport today so the three

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,240
challenges we have the first one is high

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,010
five one so turn high five one board

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,530
into USB mass-storage that you connect

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,570
to your to your computer so you will

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,330
have to port the USB 1.1 stack using

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,190
GPIO s and you'll be able to mount the

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,900
flash on the board to your to your

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,580
computer the person who gets the highest

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,860
speed writing and reading a single one

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,900
megabyte block pool will win the high

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,480
five Unleashed challenge is to port a

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,890
web browser to risk 5 and the person who

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,750
achieves the highest score running the

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,570
jet stream 1.1 browser benchmark will

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,870
win and the third category is to just go

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:09,079
at the coolest demo so and which will be

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:11,030
voted by the sy 5 group so obviously you

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,439
don't need to come stay all day long at

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,390
the high 5 hackathon you can you know

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,490
pop in and out if you're also interested

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,370
in just just experience respond you can

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,520
stop by 2 to play around with the board

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,319
there's also Boff Boff tables verse 5

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,569
Zephyr and respond Linux drivers will be

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,470
discussed at the 23rd floor so please

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:32,270
come so for those who can't wait to go

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,250
hack on the hardware I have some good

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,860
news for you we've also open source to

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,930
freedom platform so that means you can

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,700
take the risk by rocket CPU which is

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,170
open source tiling the career and chip

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,210
interconnect low-speed peripherals

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,820
high-speed Xilinx peripheral wrappers

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,559
for DDR PCIe and map that onto your own

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,120
FPGA so you can see on the

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,070
that's the freedom everywhere platform

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,419
mapped onto an FPGA on the bottom that's

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,570
the freedom unleashed platform mapped

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:58,419
onto an FPGA with some PCI cards you can

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,320
see doom is also working on that

00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:03,440
unfortunately there is some third-party

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,509
IPS that that has to kept close source

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,120
because of India reasons you can get

00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,279
access to those by using the sci-fi chip

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,740
design services however so if you're

00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,629
interested check out Devdas i-5 comm or

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,529
sci-fi of github organization or free
