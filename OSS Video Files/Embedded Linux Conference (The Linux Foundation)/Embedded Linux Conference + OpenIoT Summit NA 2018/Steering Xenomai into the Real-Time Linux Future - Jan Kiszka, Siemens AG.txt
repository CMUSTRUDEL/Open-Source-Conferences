Description: 
	Steering Xenomai into the Real-Time Linux Future - Jan Kiszka, Siemens AG

 The Xenomai project can look back on a 17 years long history now. It is being used on a significant number of mission critical systems, both in industry and academia. Still, its active developer community was always comparably small, and the loss of one of its core maintainers put the project under additional pressure.

In this talk, we will present our plans and first steps to revive the Xenomai community, make it broader and stronger. This involves scaling down the project scope to a maintainable core. We will also discuss Xenomai's role and relationship to PREEMPT-RT. Furthermore, we will look into the future of its co-kernel variant, and present first technical details of a major overhaul to simplify its maintainability and possibly make it upstream relevant.
