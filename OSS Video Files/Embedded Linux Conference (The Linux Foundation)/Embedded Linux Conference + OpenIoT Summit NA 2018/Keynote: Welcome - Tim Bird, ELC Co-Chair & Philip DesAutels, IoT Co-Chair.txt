00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,850
infrastructure platform and sousei so

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:08,430
please join me in thanking them so we've

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,380
got a lot of great content and I'm going

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,330
to turn the time over to Phillip to to

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,750
say a few words and introduce our first

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:21,150
few speakers I just wanted to ask you

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,830
know folks so who's been here for who's

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,970
here 13 years ago at the first event

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:30,810
anybody okay I see a few hands you can

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,610
put your hands up it's okay and what

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,530
about four years ago when we added in

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,619
IOT who was here four years ago for the

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,689
when we added in the IOT event event was

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,450
a lot smaller it was about that size of

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,880
the room for both events together four

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,590
years ago you know IOT was kind of in

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,360
the emergent side it was just kind of

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,659
growing up a little bit and trying to

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,310
figure out what it was we were really on

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,740
the birthing side of it and I think

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,420
Linux at the edge was kind of a hidden

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,880
thing that people hadn't really figured

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,860
out fully the nuts people in this room

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,060
but people in industry and now I was

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,219
through Tim and I were talking last

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,920
night and this morning that four years

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,780
later in just four years right it's not

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,709
that much time when you look out in the

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,890
marketplace at what's going on and

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,360
you know the really seminal role of

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,360
Linux at the edge the reverse of the

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,280
cloud and the the growth of little

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,560
things beyond that and how that

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,970
enablement really looks like a mirror of

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,050
what we're doing on the other side of

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,520
the world right we're taking little

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,200
things and connecting them up to the

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,580
cloud and now we're taking little things

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,500
and connecting to the edge and bring

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,670
them together and that growth I mean Tim

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,220
you've been here through the whole thing

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,610
oh yeah I've been around a long time I

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,099
did I didn't need these when we started

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:46,170
but I think that really comes to comes

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,720
to the you know to the agenda we have

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,760
today and through the event if you look

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,590
through it the the intertwining it was

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,350
really hard as we were going through and

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,299
reviewing I know on your side and on the

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,709
IOT side it's really hard reviewing

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,540
sessions because a lot of the sessions

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,880
sat in both sides of the camp right oh

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,640
yeah it should this behind me I'm

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,230
excited is this is this an open IOT or

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,030
are they both and a lot of them were

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,950
both and that really talks to how this

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,750
is starting to really come together this

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,100
year yeah yeah I think there's a great

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,400
synergy between these two events if you

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:22,170
if you're doing IOT you know you're you

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,390
there's stuff out in the leaf nodes of

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,799
course and so there's stuff that may not

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,870
may or may not be Linux but you've

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,820
you're they're definitely going through

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,090
some Linux nodes on your on your edge

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,280
and and into the cloud and so I think

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,140
this this is a great combination event

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,690
for for covering that whole range of

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,790
things yeah I think one of the things

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,320
we're seeing in this year's session a

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,019
lot is the emergence of some real

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,380
patterns in this space that we're

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,320
starting to really go from DIY to

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,109
monoliths of solutions to real patterns

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,720
of how you build at the edge for certain

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,739
domains anthony our next speaker and i

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,620
were talking a little bit ago but

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,019
enterprise patterns versus you know om

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,790
patterns versus consumer patterns and

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,940
how those are starting to emerge and

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,500
really fit together these pieces in a

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,720
unique way that's different than what

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,760
the cloud is it's complementary but it

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,680
is very unique to the edge and it is its

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,079
whole own whole world that's really

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,079
