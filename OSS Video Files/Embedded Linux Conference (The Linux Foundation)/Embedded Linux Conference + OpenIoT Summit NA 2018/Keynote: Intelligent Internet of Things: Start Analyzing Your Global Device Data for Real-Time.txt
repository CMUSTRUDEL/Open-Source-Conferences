so thank you and thanks very much for

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,740
having me I mean it's it's kind of a

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,810
long story with Philly but I'm really

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,570
glad to be here and thank you for for

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,550
being here as well I was at the RFID

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,139
conference an RFID conference last week

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,030
and you know they kind of coined the

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,699
term IOT and I started by saying hey you

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,680
know what IH is going to disappear so

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,720
they kind of like that and the reality

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,000
is I think IOT will disappear because we

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,519
have to make it disappear because if you

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,720
think about it it's not about connecting

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,670
things so much we've been talking about

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,199
billions of devices connected I stopped

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,989
showing slides about billions of devices

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,090
being connected it's really about what

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,120
you can get out of IOT devices and IOT

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,590
deployment and really focus on the

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,660
outcome that you can get out of IOT

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,980
think about your mobile phone you don't

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,660
really think you know it's kind of

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,430
Bluetooth Wi-Fi cell or you don't really

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,260
care what you care is when you use your

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,850
Google Maps you kind of get to the place

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,469
you want to go it's when you look at

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,510
your email you get that it's when you

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,770
chat you get your chance it's not so

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,140
much about protocol it's not about

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,550
connectivity it's about what you can get

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,670
out of that and that's really the

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,920
important thing I owe an IOT journey for

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,100
customer is really about the outcome not

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,540
so much about how it's done so if you

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,900
think about different use case think

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,630
about try to imagine a city with no

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,759
congestion that's something that IOT can

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,130
get through connected cars and better

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,080
traffic management etc think about

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,810
airports with no delays some of you

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,880
probably flew in today or yesterday and

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,220
you know if you get no delays for planes

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,829
it's because the the the engines are

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,229
working well the the the baggages are

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,100
flowing the customers the passengers are

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,520
flowing this is what IOT can can deliver

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,140
imagining energy consumption everywhere

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,670
optimal optimal level you know for

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,649
buildings one of some of the largest

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,509
polluter in the world so how can they

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,820
get the better energy consumption so you

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,850
don't pollute as much and think about

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,979
medicine how can you get medicine

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,020
tailored really for you that's also an

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,350
IOT use case think about it's knowing

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,240
yourself knowing the the having samples

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,670
of data across population to really

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,399
understand what fits for you and your

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,179
profile so when we talk to enterprising

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,540
customer

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,430
really about those three problems

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,859
they're trying to solve one is reducing

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,510
risk the other one is optimizing cost

00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:20,849
and the last one is growing their

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,390
business reducing risk is really better

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,099
understand the systems and what they're

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,530
using to make sure they can predict any

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,480
failure they can have a better

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,239
visibility of what's going on in their

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,819
you know in their systems and avoiding

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,680
any downtime or anything like that the

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,049
second one is optimizing assets there's

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,609
a finite amount of resources that they

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,250
have at their disposal outside of money

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:46,200
or assets or people they need to really

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,000
optimize that and get the most out of it

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,709
and by understanding what's going on

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,709
they can really optimize those those

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,359
assets and optimize their cost and

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,980
growth is really about creating new

00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:57,540
business models and we're talking a

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,060
little bit about insurance some point is

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,889
how do you change your business model

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,319
through better understanding of the data

00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,730
of anything that's happening in the

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,319
vehicle system you're in

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,909
so those three those three are really

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,469
what we're talking with customers and

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,329
enterprise it's not so much about how am

00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,220
I going to connect my things however do

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:16,229
I deal with security it's all about

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,090
outcome for them and that's through

00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,739
outcome that we can actually sell those

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,180
IOT projects and deploy those IOT

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,439
projects correctly because the ROI

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,500
becomes justifies so when we look at the

00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,319
three challenges here you go the three

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,930
challenges of IOT it's always kind of

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,780
the same across every industry across

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,090
all customers it's about security how do

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,889
you securely connect devices how do you

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,680
secure access to the devices how do you

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,729
secure communication and control of

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,099
those devices

00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,449
it's about scaling and we're talking

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,310
about big data it's fairly easy to

00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,650
connect a few hundred thousand devices

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,329
that's fine when you start hitting a

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,340
million two million five million ten

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,650
million devices or very high throughput

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,930
for example video streaming from cameras

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,030
that becomes really really hard to do

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,269
and that's becoming quickly a problem

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,340
for for customers and finally why are we

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,680
even connecting all those things why do

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,959
we deploy scalable infrastructure is to

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,819
get insights out of the data and without

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,019
in sighs there's no IOT really if

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,000
there's no point of connecting

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,800
you need to get the insights to justify

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,330
the ROI and not improve your products

00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,320
improve your customer engagement and

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:29,680
improve your business overall so I'll

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,710
start with data lots of lots of data and

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,830
what we see and we're seeing it quite a

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,020
lot Google is across all industries

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,120
you're getting an amount of data that's

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,490
unprecedented we're shifting from human

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,500
generated data where you were swiping on

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,560
phone tapping clicking you're loading

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,360
pages generating logs out of that or

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,160
you're interacting with some devices

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,470
that are connected in your door that

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,750
opens or valve that you turn on that's

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,510
human generated data and that's fairly

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,040
discrete and limited now we're shifting

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,800
to a world where the data is generated

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,210
constantly 24/7 by machines at very high

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,130
scale and if you look at different

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,640
industries you know manufacturing is an

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,470
example there's a customer of ours that

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,170
has a machine that makes paper to create

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,880
diapers and those machines generate

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,330
about 4 terabyte of data per year and

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,990
that's per machine so we have a plant of

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,210
machines

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,280
that's pretty quickly a lot a lot of

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,470
data that they have to manage in

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,270
healthcare we have a customer called

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,520
Dexcom that's working with very early

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,860
one of the alphabet medical device

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,950
company and those guys are doing a

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,360
glucose monitoring for diabetes and the

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,340
amount of data there generally is about

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,200
a terabyte per month for those glucose

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,030
monitoring so it's a little bit of data

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,820
per person but there's so many of it and

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,230
that's compressed data so when they

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,090
uncompress it to analyze this about 10

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,520
times that size about 10 10 terabyte of

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,100
data per month generated by just glucose

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,260
monitoring it's pretty pretty staggering

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,780
amount in transportation we think about

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,060
autonomous driving but there's car

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,169
there's trucks there's flattened flight

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,100
know the planes

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,680
there's boats fleets you know a lot of

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,080
the assets that are moving generate a

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,720
ton of data and more and more actually

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,180
every new car every new truck has more

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,760
data and more sensors than before that's

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,680
about 22 to 25 gigabyte per hour

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,160
potentially of data generated and that

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,860
allows insurances to get more insights

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,360
for example how do you drive how do we

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,800
break how do you accelerate how do you

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,569
turn how long do you drive

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,979
do you drive you know in what condition

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,590
are you driving all that can influence

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:38,530
for example new business model for

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,830
insurances insurances also can insure

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,990
for example in a fleet management system

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,050
where you're transporting perishable

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,810
goods if the truck fails the entire

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,849
shipment can be thrown to the to the

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,680
trash so insurances could be adapted

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,180
based on how you maintain the truck not

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,669
so much on the workloads it's kind of an

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,229
interesting model in consumer product we

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,360
have a customer it's a toy company

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,849
that's an interesting one because toys

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,530
have no games for kids now it's all on

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,030
iPad and the phones like my kids keep

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,360
playing on the phones it's kind of

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,310
annoying that I lost the use of no using

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,199
real toys in real life toys so that

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,120
company or customers is building

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,099
connected toys that allow the kids to

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,250
play with physical toys but with other

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:23,229
players across the globe by via the

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,000
platform so that that those product

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,849
lines were going to generate about 4

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,990
gigabyte per day per product line so

00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:33,580
again it's a data challenge for them and

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,050
when you start collecting that amount of

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,000
data and you're talking petabytes of

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,979
data or exabyte of data which is the

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,169
scale of Google operates you're really

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,610
starting to master Big Data but more

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,310
importantly than mastering B data you

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,020
become a data-driven company and that's

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,479
really what changes the game in how you

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,120
can deliver business Google has done

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,490
that for quite some time you know

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,880
we have about seven products today that

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,889
have over billion active users on the

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,580
platform so that's you're talking search

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,080
YouTube Gmail enter in maps you know

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,389
some of those products so we've been

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,449
doing big data for quite some time

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,400
actually that big data has allowed us to

00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,900
supercharge innovation and you think

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,550
about the innovation that was generated

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,620
by Google we've been at it for about 15

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,900
years

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,659
you know through examples like the

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,279
Google file system that was in 2002 I

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:26,080
think we launched the Google PI system

00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,949
that was a time where people were

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,569
deploying NetApp racks and no harddrive

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,849
where Google was taking cheap hardware

00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,919
and doing a distributed file system

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,349
across all our data center so is a

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,589
completely complete shift of how you

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,830
handle big data already in 2002 that led

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,570
to paper that

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,310
to a distributed system processing

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,530
system across that cheap hardware which

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,960
was my produce a lot of paper published

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,850
yeah who took that over created a loop

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,060
and then he took about ten years from

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,770
2002 to about 2010 twelve were a lot of

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,490
enterprise starting to use a dupe at

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,860
scale that's ten yearly timer of Google

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,330
versus the industry where we've been

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,910
doing this kind of big data it's the

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,980
same thing for BigTable you know in 2005

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,560
became HBase became the base for HBase

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,080
and Cassandra and so on and so forth so

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,760
those those technologies that we're

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,160
going to be using for ten years ten

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,380
years ahead of the industry you know in

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,210
ten years at the time the 50 in ten

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,030
years at that time about 50% of the

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,070
doujins company got taken off the list

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,380
and you can think about the technology

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,170
choices as this company have made that's

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,020
big big shift and what we've done is

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,180
really trying to as we move from just

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,800
google.com and kind of our services at

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,620
Google to an order price player with

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,910
Google cloud platform we're trying to

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,890
take those services and make them

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,590
available to our customers through

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,690
services like bigquery which is a

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,940
petabyte scale data warehousing tool if

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,550
you do a query on bigquery you actually

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,310
use Dremel right in the backend no data

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,530
flow BigTable is insane to use BigTable

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,510
you're gonna use the actual BigTable

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,390
from that we've had for so many years

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,780
but those services become available to

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:13,520
our customers talking more about IOT we

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,290
just launched last February in in GA a

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,900
new service called clarity core that's

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,370
more relevant to that audience

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,490
clarity core was announced in May and

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,710
when beta in September's and now GA this

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,320
is really the service that allows you to

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,900
connect millions of devices to the GCP

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,450
cloud bi-directionally it's an amputee t

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,310
bridge HTTP bridge handles the

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,710
authentication the device management and

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,660
all the communication what's very

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,090
interesting with IOT core is that it's

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,480
one of those services alongside pub/sub

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:47,210
and others that are built on top of the

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,830
platform and that's a very very

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,450
different thing that you have to think

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,250
about when you think about the Google

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,160
services a lot of the cloud vendors

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,400
build their main business on top of

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,720
their cloud we

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,830
build our cloud on top of our main

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,510
business that's a completely reversed

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,970
infrastructure because the Google the

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,340
Google infrastructure was built to

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,220
handle your billions of users across the

00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,520
globe building GCP on top of it actually

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,550
allows us to have the only owned and

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,930
operated fibre network across the globe

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,080
what that means do you have about 100

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,370
point of presence that all devices 44

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,930
can connect to when you when you're

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,360
going on your web browser and you do

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,380
Google calm no matter where you are in

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,820
the world you're going to learn to the

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,490
closest pop that's really what it does

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,560
for devices it's the same with IOT core

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,990
you have a MQTT to Google API comm

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,820
across the globe you'll always get to

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,080
the closest pop and then get to the

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,730
region you want to through our fibre

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,310
network that allows you to reduce

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,570
latency reduce manufacturing costs and I

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,400
have to think about where is that device

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,180
going to be shipped you don't have to

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,340
think about that

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,650
everything is global and you don't have

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,090
to worry about where things are they're

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,720
just gonna connect to the to the best

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,940
place let's talk about security talked

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,910
about data is talk about security very

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,330
very important to actually dear to my

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:09,000
heart with IOT core we chose to use TLS

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,830
for connectivity for encryption public

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,410
key infrastructure so public and private

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,140
key for devices but we try to not load

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,670
devices so we're not using the mutual

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,230
authentication of the TLS stack we're

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,080
just using TLS to establish a connection

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,900
with a Google Furnham then you'll

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,070
created tokens a little JSON payload and

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,870
you're going to sign that job with a

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,960
private key that sits on the device and

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,560
pass that as your password for the MQTT

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
connect

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,890
there's no handshake there is no hosting

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,420
of the certificate on the device there

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,700
is no hosting a public key on the device

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,770
the TLS tack is much smaller you're less

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,290
dependent on the TLS tag you can use any

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,090
TPM you want and we have a partnership

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,510
with microchip that allows you to use

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,430
their crypto to sign those jobs and you

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,100
know secure the private key X era so

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,380
what you're getting there is something

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,430
that where I find pretty fun we've been

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:02,070
able to create an 8-bit MCU with a Wi-Fi

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,200
module and a crypto chip that's a

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,300
reference design that can connect

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,570
securely using the public private key

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,670
TLS to IOT core partner actually

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,470
with an 8-bit MCU I don't think

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,389
anybody's been able to do that and you

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,149
have to admit this is pretty fun this

00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:21,089
will actually allow you to do very very

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:22,589
wide scale deployment of connected

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,259
devices for command and control or

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,660
sensing and that's because the stack

00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:31,290
actually fits in about 10k I'm pretty

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,600
small some example smart CDs more in

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,829
smart cities so a customer of ours smart

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
parking technology is building the

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:39,509
sensors that you put on the ground and

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,910
can see the the cars if they're present

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,130
or not they switched from their own

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,069
back-end to IOT core and the rest of the

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,810
DCP they've been able to go from one to

00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,130
two week deployment of a parking lot to

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,690
two to three days because of the

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,220
simplicity of deployment before they had

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,560
to deploy and configure each of those

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,670
little sensors in the ground now they

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,190
just configure them at manufacturing

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,360
time and deploy them that's a 50% we

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,370
don't show any time to market that

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,430
allows them to go in the UK in

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,690
Netherland in Australia I mean they're

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,310
deploying different countries really

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,720
really fast right now thanks to that so

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,290
they've been pretty vocal about their

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,300
their deployment that's a cool customer

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:21,060
example so security big data security

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:24,959
insights those three pillars insights is

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,839
all about data analytics ml and ai ai

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,760
it's been identified as the new

00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,930
competitive edge a lot of the companies

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,880
that use AI in their business 46% of the

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,569
IT leaders said it is a competitive

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,760
differentiator

00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,819
that's pretty staggering as a number and

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,519
actually 50% of them of the people who

00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:45,540
use they I can put a 25 the Aero I and

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,220
that's very important because if you

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,949
can't quantify your ROI you're not doing

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,230
the investment so it's faster decision

00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:54,569
it's faster execution you know more

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,180
data-driven decision that's pretty

00:14:54,569 --> 00:15:00,600
pretty impressive numbers in know the

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,510
benefit of AI that you can get and let's

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,759
take an example with Airbus so Airbus

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,370
has been working at a problem for about

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,750
20 years what they want to know is when

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,370
they look at a picture like that and

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,050
they were doing it manually at start

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,279
they would get the picture so in the

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,850
satellite and what they want to know is

00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,709
is that snow is that water is that cloud

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,970
so they were doing it manually and then

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,860
they started to grow the number of

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,200
images to a point where it was

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,090
10,000 images a day they had to process

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,730
that was almost impossible to manage

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:34,020
they created some algorithms and a male

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:35,940
model and and got to about 4 13 14

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,830
percent error rate on those images which

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,660
it should be pretty good took them 20

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,370
years to get there so they came to

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,950
Google and they say hey can you help us

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,380
with this like what can you do what

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:49,590
we've done is applied those images to

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,630
our cloud machine learning engine run

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,670
those models in about a month with one

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,580
engineer we got those down to about 4

00:15:53,670 --> 00:16:00,750
percent error rate we got the training

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,180
time from 50 hours to 30 minutes that's

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:06,090
really much faster yeah which is pretty

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,160
cool because time for AI is really

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,170
important if you're building models and

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,810
you have to test them train them refine

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,490
you can't just spend your hours and days

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,290
on the desktop to train those molly's it

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,570
just doesn't work the data scientists

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,640
like 20 their time waiting for the model

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,470
to be trained so you need to go fast and

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,060
that's how you refine the models and

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,920
make them more accurate so in this case

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,530
those are the clouds up there so I don't

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,120
know if you if you saw them but this is

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,710
this is what the algorithms giving them

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,360
so this is this has been very very

00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,220
interesting you see in a month you know

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,880
that the benefit they've got out of AI

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,190
and using the cloud email engine the

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,800
problem which in learning today is that

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,780
you need data scientists and there are

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,310
really nice people but out of 21 million

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,710
developers there's only about a million

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,960
data scientists and if you talk about

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,210
deep learning researchers that's in the

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,250
thousands of people it's very very

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,250
little super hard to get any data

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,350
scientist or very deep learning

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,890
researchers so the problem is how do you

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:11,520
how do you get that power to the masses

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,980
of developers so we started by doing AI

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,840
a building blocks those are building

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,670
blocks in like cloud translation you

00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,320
have a text in English and you want to

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,470
in French to send it to an API while

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,570
return in French that's pretty easy you

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,400
have vision API you know send an image

00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:29,340
will tell you what's an image the dog is

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,340
that it's a cat cat we know really well

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,929
now

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,070
people you know you can get a lot of

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,080
things out of the club usually if you

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,350
have for those you really don't need any

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,850
machine learning knowledge just sin you

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,490
know what you want it returns a

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:47,039
classification with probabilities so we

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,360
have natural language prolonged words

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,580
that's more to understand what's being

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,919
asked the cloud speech you know voice

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,120
two tags and the video intelligence to

00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,980
know what's happening in the video which

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,299
is super important we've been able to do

00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,799
those because if you think about video

00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,389
intentions for example we have YouTube

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,070
videos we have millions and millions of

00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:04,409
YouTube videos so we have a very very

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,419
big training set that we can train on

00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:09,090
and really get those super super

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,429
accurate the problem is when we show for

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,750
example the cloud vision API to

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,669
companies they say oh it's great you can

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,880
find cats but you know what I want is

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:19,409
really to find the out of my

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,110
manufacturing light what are the

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:23,970
elements that are you know not produced

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,440
correctly which one do I have to discard

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,960
or not that's really what you need to

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,659
figure out so the vision API is not is

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,090
not enough so we just released a cloud

00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:35,519
or two ml which builds on the foundation

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,269
of the api's but allows you to create

00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:41,820
your own models out of the APS that we

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:45,000
have so very easily build models through

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,100
a graphical user interface you can no

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,070
train your model very easily you need

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,350
limited ml into the ML expertise our

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,139
model in back-end will reprogram itself

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,480
and provide you a API for the specific

00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:59,940
use case that you want so that allows

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,269
you to give access to people that are

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,029
not data scientist to all the power of

00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:09,090
the Google cloud platform in in machine

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:11,130
learning the cool thing about it is

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,200
behind it we realized that when you do

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,450
those trainings you can use CPUs you can

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,279
use GPUs that's great but you know even

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,440
with all the GPS in the world you can

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,200
get to where we need to be in terms of

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,600
training models so Google's been set up

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,580
making that better and we created our

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,269
own processors that are focused on

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,820
tensorflow

00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:32,130
so we call them a tensor processing unit

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,649
those are actually pretty big they're

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,600
about they're about that big they don't

00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:39,040
run on battery I can tell you and they

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,700
need to be cooled pretty

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,890
already heavily those are specialized TP

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,070
use just for training and doing

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,960
inferencing on four tenths of flow so

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,970
you manage them from the cloud you

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,130
locate them to your to your workload and

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,870
really can accelerate I was talking

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,760
about time you can really accelerate how

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,100
you're processing those models and you

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,740
know making them more accurate through

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,480
this kind of this kind of machine so we

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,890
have new versions coming every time but

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,080
we're using those already internally

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,670
those have become publicly available to

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,010
our customers so that's really to

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:15,400
improve the speed of getting those

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,440
models on one example of using machine

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,030
learning model that I'm really like this

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,730
little company called Odin technology

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,080
it's kind of small small company and in

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,910
one of their talk I really liked how

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,870
they introduced it they say we're

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:30,550
working with the 99% of manufacturing

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:33,190
this because not only not every not

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,830
every manufacturer is Tesla or Toyota

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,290
with no robots that are building stuff

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,050
on a you know just-in-time provisioning

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,970
of parts and all automated that's super

00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,950
cool but really most of the

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,810
manufacturing it's not that they have

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,090
old machines it's kind of greasy you

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,530
know 15 20 year old machines they do

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,180
colleague data but locally on the

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,620
machine so there's a little little

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,120
device there that you can see but it's

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,610
not it's not connected they don't know

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,780
really how to optimize this machine so

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,950
Odin went with a Raspberry Pi a

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,240
ruggedized Raspberry Pi in a little box

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,470
and they thought they would fail with

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,510
this because that are our new industrial

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,250
Raspberry Pi I don't want it actually

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,130
it's very successful so they plug that

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,490
to two machines get the data in their

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,740
cloud train that train models on Google

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,890
and then and then provide those insights

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,570
to customers so in this example one of

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,240
their customers has a plastic molding

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,370
machine so they put a little plastic

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,830
little balls there and it goes in there

00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,540
it's melted it's rolled it's expanded

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,340
and then it's it's molded there's

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,490
several processes to that machine and

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,650
just by optimizing the changeover when

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,270
do you do the when do you do the the

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,060
melting when do you do the roll when do

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,580
you do the molding and how do you change

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,580
the machine configuration just by doing

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,279
that they save 3500 hours of production

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,739
time per year which is about a million

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,229
of production that that customer has

00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:57,809
gained just through insights of change

00:21:55,229 --> 00:22:00,919
over that's a pretty staggering benefit

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:04,109
just applying AI you know going through

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:08,940
fidelity core pops up and dataflow and

00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:12,210
some of the AI engine so to conclude if

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,719
we want IOT to disappear it's not it's

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:18,389
really through making sin making the

00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:19,950
three pillar of IOT seamless so the IOT

00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:22,710
connectivity we talked about security

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,450
and scale the big data for storing and

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,690
analyzing big data and all the tools you

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,339
need that and the machine learning model

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,919
to really get the insight and it's when

00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,779
the three together are similar for

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,729
customers that then IOT starts to be

00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:39,710
disappearing and we only talk about

00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:43,379
insights and outcome for customers on

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,119
that I thank you and you know if you

00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,830
interested in what we do at Google and

00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,559
IOT this is called the google.com slash

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,450
IOT very easy to get to so thank you

00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:56,749
very much
