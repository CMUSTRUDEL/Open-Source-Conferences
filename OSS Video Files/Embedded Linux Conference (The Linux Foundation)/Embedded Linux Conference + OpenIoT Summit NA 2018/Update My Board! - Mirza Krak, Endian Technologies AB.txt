	Update My Board! - Mirza Krak, Endian Technologies AB

There are now well established open-source solutions to do software updates on your embedded Linux device that have been "battle tested", that we can collaborate on to make the complexity of software updates manageable. These projects usually come with an reference implementation using a popular community board (BBB or raspberrypi) which can be used for initial testing.

In this talk Mirza will present how to integrate a number of open-source software update solution to a custom board and go trough the steps necessary for each project, because in the end the hardship/easiness of integrating the project with your custom board could be the deciding factor when deciding which project to use.

The projects that Mirza will cover are:

- SWupdate
- Mender
- aktualizr (libostree)
- resin.io

Attendees are expected to have basic knowledge of software update key concepts and Yocto/OE-core since all of the above projects rely heavily on it for board integration.
