Description: 
	Secure Containers in Embedded Deployments - Stefano Stabellini, Xen Project

Containers are extremely convenient to package applications and deploy them quickly across the data center. They enable microservices oriented approaches to the development of complex apps. These technologies and trends are benefitting the data center, but are struggling to find their place in embedded environments.

As embedded developers, we would like the convenience of containers for deployment, while retaining real-time capabilities and supporting mixing and matching of applications with different safety and criticality profiles on the same board. This hasn't been possible so far.

This talk will present a novel approach based on embedded hypervisors to run container apps on small embedded devices without sacrificing real-time or safety. The presentation will discuss ways to reduce the footprint of Docker apps and will show safe techniques to give them direct access to hardware.
