Description: 
	Preempt-RT Raspberry Pi Linux - Tiejun Chen, VMware

 As we known, the Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. now it is very popular around our IoT world, and you can see many guys use Pi to build great things, and even it can play a role in the production environment. The official Raspberry Pi Linux, https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux, maintain Linux kernel specific to Pi platform. But it does not including Preempt RT Linux support. Obviously, in some IoT cases we really need to meet hard real time requirement. In this presentation, we will review if-how can integrate Preempt RT Linux patches to Pi Linux, including what are those problems for this particular hardware platform. 

About Tiejun Chen
Tiejun Chen is a staff engineer and one technical leader from ATC, Advanced Technology Center, VMware China R&D. In recent years he is working on some projects or explorations involved Linux, Unikernel, IoT, Edge Computing, container, etc. Before join VMware, he ever worked at Wind River System where he was responsible of developing Wind River Linux BSP, Kernel features and Wind River's own hypervisor and paraviratualized guest OS, and contributed into mainstream like Linux/PowerPC/MIPS/RT Linux. And he also joined Intel OTC where he was working on enabling new hardware features on open source technologies like KVM/XEN/Qemu.

In 2017, he made several presentation about his unikernel project, UniLinux, at LC3 China, OSS North America, OSS & ELC Europe and RT-Summit Europe.

good afternoon everyone and thank you

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,210
very much for coming here to my

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,130
presentation today so I'd like to start

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,800
off by introducing myself

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,429
you see my name is a Ian Chen about you

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,760
can continue I'm from we ever China Andy

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,930
ATC otherwise the Technology Center in

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,269
our team over the past year I'm really

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,519
mostly working on that LT internet I was

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,880
seen and at computing and other

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,679
exploration religious as IOT but

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,239
actually besides I'm also have some

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,380
personal intuition like eunuch Colonel

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,050
last year I also made a several

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,190
presentation about my unicorn or

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,800
exploration for some open source emits

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,739
hosted by aliens Foundation an Allison

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,430
catch my eye is at real-time modulation

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,430
I think that is a good candidate to IOT

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,100
okay this all before enjoying VMware I

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,020
also work at a several company you might

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,229
hate some name neck up in the river

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,049
system where I will respond all for that

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,030
when the river links Colonel and PSP

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,850
development and even the river the

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,610
virtual I should technology like when I

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,960
roll a brother and our paralyzed guest

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,299
OS and also working at Intel Oh T C open

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,590
source technology center mostly our

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,900
tumor was trying to enable that some new

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,390
Intel hydro features to almond sauce

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,799
technology communities like qem and

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,520
Dylan and Camille

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,869
okay so that's some somebody myself

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,040
today I'm going to talk about that

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,530
parameter RT rather burnings

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,990
frankly I think it's a small story you

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,840
can mention but I think that should be

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,450
helpful I think when you are sitting

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,460
here you should allow inks you probably

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,280
use a rubber pad beautiful some allergy

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,110
application a synchronizer prime an RT

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,939
account contribute to some extent okay

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,820
each time I how to make this sort of

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,819
sediment you know it's just my personal

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,530
development my personal exploration so

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,230
it's not a real demamp or commitment

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,290
from VMware

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,319
let's to go straight to the agenda there

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,209
are a few items here first of all I'd

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,239
like to introduce my motivation and

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,420
secondly let's look at that Raspberry Pi

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,700
hardware quickly and suddenly I like to

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,430
talk about it beat that real term and

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,220
especially for real-time links firstly

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,370
and let's review one how and what we

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,470
have done in term of that red berry

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,590
links we also had it at a single

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,920
evaluation the NAS project is about a

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,950
road map on my side on what we can do in

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,280
the future

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,860
ok motivation and let me hear from I can

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,989
make my point from here so in the very

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,660
beginning I mentioned I'm working on LTS

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,599
so out he basically means that we

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,209
connect that a variety of device and we

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,370
exchange it date then we have that data

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,610
analytics either you know cloud all

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,709
inside outside whatever so this data

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,790
processing can come out a real business

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:20,489
value like that's provided at predict

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,280
you from order to behavior then can make

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,170
our life better and the same and even it

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,510
can contribute the summer cutting edge

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,319
technology like emotional Lane under the

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,090
blockchain

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,760
you know emotionally needed that's a

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,920
huge amount of data to Train now LT can

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,829
come out that's it he would amount the

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,680
data and blockchain blockchain can help

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,030
us protected at a sensitive data in some

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,100
cases like the

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,750
you may recall we call needed to

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,790
communicate to another women curve we

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,850
needed to use a sort all that data

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:55,620
sharing case we needed at blockchain

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,530
okay go back out is that building our

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,769
intelligent device and system make up LG

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,130
that internet was in but the West Omaha

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,109
Jason actually our traditional system a

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,569
red purple should be the one of these

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,130
typical and by the system I guess that

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,870
should be good references for your

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,930
healthy on that set some gear on and we

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,390
now are links had become such a popular

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,990
open system to that in by the system and

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,830
now to let out addressed and remembers I

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,120
will report

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:33,000
and that said so a to said our algorithm

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,039
what he proud of is an links so you can

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,189
links can play well and you know I would

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,830
kiss so in my point that links based

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,960
Raspberry Pi should be the best way to

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,969
get started on working on IOT

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,159
development to build up your our

00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:51,120
technology and expanded more that how to

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:55,379
use a kiss but outing you needed to

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,710
consider your time for example our

00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:02,639
current we have that airbag we have a

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,620
breaker system we have that ABS these

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,710
action so she ate Dyson should be

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,199
responding in real time otherwise there

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,940
should be the disaster I even talked

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,509
about some that gadget

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,490
unlike some variable devices we've

00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:19,860
probably use data to monitor your body

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,330
feature like heartbeat it was this

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,370
device it can alter connect that

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,389
information precisely I think it's

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,819
important lesson okay so I think a new

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,800
device device and you to meet it at a

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,770
real time requirement but an inner

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,419
cannot do this so I'd like to integrate

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,229
the brown links together rather brave

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:44,279
padding's another reason I like to

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:47,550
mention here separately I guess many

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,680
other yoga maybe like me like you that

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,680
the summer open source a hardware

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,310
platform or some open source of that

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,930
software ecosystem to build your

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,659
application but the often time you want

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,300
to use the permalinks but don't support

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:06,930
as providing ins so you have to build

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,879
that you have to do that by yourself so

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,909
it's maybe it's not very difficult but

00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,310
it's not a convenient so last year I

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:17,219
started thinking whether we can put some

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,860
time and effort to anybody that provide

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,490
links to this kind of user scenario I I

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,740
want to construct my project that IP

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,409
re-enabling provide links everyone so

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,870
provide that amateur raspberry links

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,870
should be one over the part another part

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,599
that links kids are already integrated

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,669
at apparent link so to Lillian's kid an

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,370
increase is rather to kids are founded

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,220
about doc

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,680
corporate basically it can help us build

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,510
at a minimal that's links colonel system

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,660
which has cleared all the necessary

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:53,080
components and each component of each

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,050
system services a container you can

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,090
replace each of the components with

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,490
another component add a new requirement

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,070
I think that's an indicator should be a

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,900
good candidate to the IOT so also have

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,900
some remaining projects I'm working on

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:15,340
now let's look at that Raspberry Pi so

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,669
I'm not from rather bad foundation but I

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,949
think relevant very successful I guess

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,820
you can see that right we're in a school

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:27,190
for education and even you can build

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,970
some of the abadeer as its parent some

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:34,900
of my friends the you that red berry bad

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:38,020
to replace that by a Rooter to build up

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,169
that smart home like a Raspberry Pi that

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,479
out a kid away in the home another my

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,539
friend that you will add multiple at

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,750
very bad I would at a minimal data

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,840
center he deployed at spark under the to

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,000
that real-time analytics and even use

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,139
some other Sakamoto stage you also can

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,990
find a Raspberry Pi I read one that a

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,360
article that you mentioned some company

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,780
not an easy they put the raspberry pi

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,510
use the huge explain for to operate a

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,460
customer and some of that web hosting

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,580
provider they provided rather very best

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,169
service so now I guess one day you can

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,860
see at the Red Baron in the real

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:24,340
incentive so to me I think I'll burp I

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,960
should be a fantastic now let's look at

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,789
hardware if i remember that correctly

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,990
the first ready prepare was launched

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:37,360
into sonic growl and since that several

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,599
generation already prepare had been

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,620
released so no we have that from rather

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,600
parent zero one and the two and three so

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,480
it's based on different armor

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,080
architecture talk about the latest read

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,340
purpose three I think

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:58,930
powerful it has a full code at cortex

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:02,210
a53 it's based on an armored v8 and

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,670
besides that it's held at some fictional

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:08,930
it official ability wafer and a USB and

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:12,350
HDMI so I had one chick by tomorrow

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,990
I like our traditional desktop so

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,170
basically I think resurrection is small

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,600
but affordable I mean it's low cost in

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,930
by the system you can help you

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,760
accelerate your arity development

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:31,070
especially we can put that in the Audi

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,890
TT relevant I dimensional example so now

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,320
let's look at that a real term what's

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,450
real term I think that the one good way

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,540
to underneath just look at those

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,700
existing at us real time open system

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,070
look at on were today and trying to

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,840
provider what's their featural you

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,410
probably can find someone common word

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,020
that's keyboard like interrupt and a

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,990
good context wish or prayer ambition or

00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,200
legend latency and jitter I mean the

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:04,040
variation and also maybe they said frost

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,720
oh and I like the pointer here that when

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,630
people talk about the real-time system

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,050
there are some common misconception the

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:15,740
big wine is that this thing if we're

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:18,530
acting into a millisecond or less there

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,580
can make our system real town but if we

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,180
want a Gotama

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,060
like minutes or several means it cannot

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,110
make a real opera system real time but

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,940
that's not true

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,000
I think the real-time systems should

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,540
legends in Siddim can reliably take that

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,980
on sim among the time i'm each time to

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:43,040
the SEMA scene so in term of this point

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,250
links is just a closer to that a soft

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,700
real-time software had a soft real-time

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:54,290
operating system so it's because it's

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:57,440
now designer as that audience but we

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:00,830
need so coverage go we have these per up

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,300
the links actually it's set our kernel

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:07,300
patch basically it can help us convert

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,810
the men a links to that fully parameter

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,520
colonel by a hundred percent it's not

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,270
hundred percent it's close to hundred

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,180
person what we did like this is right

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,430
out you basically no long they come to

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,590
the interrupt handler into that cannot

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,040
write a contact speech that sir either

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:30,220
can be scheduled and they also trying to

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,770
get a critical section so what happened

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,140
so what they did they are trying to get

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:38,380
as many links to have that a quicker

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,420
reaction time and help us bring down at

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,480
a latency to the minimum as very

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:49,770
possible she's like that hard time hard

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:53,130
real-time attention to earnings so

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:56,920
compiler on links to that the Menelaus

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:59,080
what had changed I think after we had

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,710
that apparent links some features like

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,110
that HRT high-resolution timer and those

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,760
interrupts rather and a mutator the

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,190
actually had already been most

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,890
interested men and Incas but it is still

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:15,370
gap bigger gap between us promote leaks

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:18,100
and many links they look to pass accent

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,470
the first you know provide means I'm

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,020
telling the mean it can call the more

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,800
that the risk education so it can cause

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,860
some a problem that you never met you

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,330
know traditional many links you may have

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,920
the figure this back to make it from

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,100
branding stable

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,020
it's one of heart another part I think I

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,240
should be big one that conversion the

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:47,110
permalinks in aiming at converting that

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,600
to get that bananas parameter gets that

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,350
a critical section parameter that means

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,380
you have the dress that spinlock issue

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,440
USB local cannot be strippable no we

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,180
need to convert that to be stable so we

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,640
needed a commercial conversion that the

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:08,850
traditionals belong to that asleep in

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,850
log they still outside that many links

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,660
also let's look at that a Raspberry Pi

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,690
links

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,870
I'm not sure everyone knows that like a

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,520
Raspberry Pi hardware platform actually

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,820
says that organization that I'd rather

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,210
buy a foundation in turn only provided

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,370
that rubber hardware platform I also

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,160
added Arab Anna meant my neck rather

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,490
behind links that is specifically mm

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,580
railroad platform they had such a nice

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,260
tone at the community and has a forum at

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,380
source code I think you can catch from

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:50,170
this ninka is one was allocated it have

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:52,720
rejected so I'm beside that's a sort of

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,510
a native links code you can find some

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,600
links the distribution links Raspberry

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:01,900
Pi foundation provided that rather pin

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,730
is based on github in that Institute

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,520
approaching specifically to rather buy a

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,710
pie besides that you also can find a

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,860
salmon because this gene us sort of a

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,120
soda party links distributions

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,090
specifically through that up right path

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,460
you can find a Ubuntu and Windows the

00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:21,880
IOT core you can find that to chain two

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,570
and open SUSE but anyway so this is in

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,980
SCADA all these needs the code of this

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,920
institution they don't provide that the

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,260
provide that's feature so again if we

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,450
want to do the branding you have actual

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,000
grab that a do patch you have the up

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,830
language on your source code you haven't

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,800
tried to build that and we can fix some

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,980
issues make that work so it's not very

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,290
convenient

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,010
so before we and integrated ran links

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,200
code let's look at what kind of cedar so

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,450
basically are now they're true that

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,810
Akita report together in terms of that

00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:02,320
primary links the hosting that they

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,810
hosted a different that means the kernel

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,590
code with additional data from

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:11,500
occupation the first git repo that hosts

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:16,690
the current of actually links

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:19,180
development if that one on the current

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,330
development or one particular active

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,420
version maybe a one day we stopped

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,660
opening that they want to switch to the

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,850
next version

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,040
that's a developer version would move

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,560
down to the second okay triple we call

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,709
that a stable archie version that will

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:41,420
be continued there we continue be a beam

00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:43,459
antenna as that stable archie version if

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,129
we don't want you that uh triple you can

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:49,069
use an eye patch directly so here you

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:52,009
can grab that are you patched and you

00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:58,160
can know that select appropriate against

00:15:52,009 --> 00:16:00,230
no you that links the source code okay

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,639
so now let's look at a way how to

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,850
integrate that into the links into the

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,819
raspberry links so why trying to least I

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:14,810
have some discussion with at one of our

00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:17,509
meetings of one over that primarily

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,670
raspberry pi links mentioned failing we

00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,550
have some disruption because I will made

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,889
sure we had a similar table make sure

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:29,060
this can be pushed into that official

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:31,790
branch so now we have some steps to make

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:35,300
it easy happen on the first page is

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,579
already it's just simple like when you

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,850
want to contribute the one know that it

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:43,970
happened just focus that and cannot

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:47,600
locally and added a to remove because it

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:52,910
causes that catch the latest Commission

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,910
support safety to that rather alpine the

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,449
failure was still one that grabs icon

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:02,180
and I discussed with ophélie so I think

00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:05,360
that one time I check out that stand

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,270
branch is the base of a tree branch and

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,360
then at that moment a crab net ladies at

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:15,350
aversion patch a plan that only suspend

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,230
branch but if we do this that a

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:22,159
developer then dollar if that any new IP

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:25,039
version passion was available we have

00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:28,459
the replace original one we use that a

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,000
new activation patch now this happen

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,010
it so happened until the speech to do

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,850
not a maintenance station so that mean

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,100
stand branch is a released is frozen so

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,710
stubborn

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,160
don't waste again so we have to follow

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:49,090
this same policy in term of that RT

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,670
branch so the picture is that they don't

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,300
replace that original that hatch version

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,250
instead we have to figure out that Devo

00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,580
let's a delta phi order be a planet

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,300
alpha out to that a standard RT branch

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,880
and sometime we haven't needed to emerge

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,470
that stand branch to make a shrew a tree

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,920
branch and have that a new feature

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,130
support of new that convincing to that

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,140
relevant pattern an allison if you have

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,930
some buttons but similar to that the

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,070
raspberry pi but it's religious at issue

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:27,100
we just apply that on that add GM branch

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:29,830
so finally i guess one of two weeks ago

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,520
we push this branch to official so

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,390
official bronze i think you can get that

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,260
instead i pi

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:41,770
- for toad 14.1 - Artie it's based on

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,540
the latest that RT version 18 19

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,540
if you would like that you can try this

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:55,410
so during this development cycle we have

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,910
we made some issue the first one is that

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,790
when you will check out these comings

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,160
camisa you not a standard prone sure you

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,130
find that some commits really touched

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,520
that common foul like that soft IQ and

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,650
HRT like at this committee they want to

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,840
convert it at one stop guy could commit

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,790
him I don't know why they wanted way

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,040
it's because that's totally go see

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,680
nothing said the NASA I don't know why

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,480
but anyway so that means each time if we

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,380
want to replace that new Artie was a

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,170
patch you have to do business again but

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:32,710
unfortunately it's not very difficult so

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:37,300
another issue the lock-up issue this is

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:39,460
because some lot of very bad sort code

00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,670
it doesn't exist you know the men are

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:47,560
links so actually Bronson have a net

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:50,560
affixed an initial data links like this

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,900
to our USB driver then that a USB

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,270
traveler into rabbit as

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,480
ready them the observer that's a local

00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,370
issue but fortunately I think some kind

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,620
already fixed that so I just pick up

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,470
that and but we did a little bit of

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,820
change you know in the kiss a prime

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:10,740
Archie we don't need that tseebo IQ we

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:16,530
can use a look-alike you and still

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:19,440
restore its parent no Artie well I guess

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:22,230
some guy and reported that the observe

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,310
this warning message that is a born in a

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:28,770
queue on number of the 59 as I discussed

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:31,610
with that feeling so basically that

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:35,610
means in the case of the rubberband

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,520
three device at SPR 1 and 2 and he want

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,330
one this shared a similar interrupting

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:45,030
line so when these are interrupt handler

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,820
iced ready them so these code is a

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:50,700
problem but we are trying to address the

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,670
problem what we could do so basically I

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,650
think that one way we can not force that

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,230
is reading and him just like our

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,640
original interrupt handler but that

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,740
could have big impact the try to

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,100
real-time performance so instead of

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,410
Philly I recommend he went to that if we

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,290
want to mask a whenever these are lq

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:15,480
which has a mask all the cpu they are

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:17,430
working on this approach now let me show

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,640
you how to one example how to build that

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:23,190
and in my case I'd like to get across

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,660
compelling but yes you definitely can

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:30,390
build you're a developer platform so but

00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,510
if we want to use all what compelling

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:39,840
you can download that from Gennaro

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:42,180
and I use that 64-bit so we know we

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,150
already in about that super Marty and by

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,620
default so you if you like to defer to

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,980
configure fear or you can catch that

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,690
enabled you also can make IPM and then

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,580
you stole the opinion but actually this

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:59,550
depends on your different distribution

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,620
okay and we have lots evaluation in my

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,519
evaluation environment I use at

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,690
Raspberry Pi ps3 model be

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,729
I press install that opens to 64-bit

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,950
obvious is that the first official on

00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:16,820
links to the building to support that a

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,909
Raspberry Pi typically we use a cyclic

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:22,399
test it's a blog it belong to that

00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:25,759
belongs to the outcasts and it has that

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:28,849
testitude help us test different

00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:31,700
educational features especially the

00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:36,499
cyclic test is the helpers and tests and

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,570
cano latency how is that work and how

00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:42,320
does it work

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:46,339
basically that's a cyclic test that if

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,979
I'm pretty fine numbers - rather those

00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:52,219
Marines read I woke up periodically with

00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:56,269
that give an interval by an experiment

00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:58,519
I'm and so after that such a difference

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:02,409
between that's a pre-programmed the

00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:05,209
timer and that actually affects you time

00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:07,369
would be a calculate and then you can

00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:11,029
find it at a minimum or maximum and

00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:14,359
average latency but I recommend you can

00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:17,570
you listen back scribe because it's your

00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:21,049
based on cyclic test but the it can

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:25,459
generated at a diagram it it's coming

00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:28,489
coming here to see that the data are so

00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:31,609
I test the three different situation or

00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:34,759
the first one I didn't enable anything

00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:38,539
it's like a typical at key complication

00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:41,659
in thermal data desktop so you can see

00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:45,979
that a latency it's about that three and

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:48,829
point 3.6 seconds when we put that

00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:51,440
latency in the context in the context of

00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:56,109
a desktop it's not a big deal but it's

00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:00,320
not good in the case of IOT so next I

00:23:56,109 --> 00:24:03,109
enable and pure and it can configure has

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,369
reduced that con Edison from the two

00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:10,909
perspective is what one it adds more

00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:14,029
that option points explicitly and also

00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:17,119
it if your coder they are not executing

00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,110
in that a critical section you can catch

00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,820
this code

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,640
to be a preemption like that a low

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,910
priority task then it comes to that I

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,299
just well it coming to return from Cisco

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,850
this low priority task would be

00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:34,520
scheduled out that a high priority task

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:38,030
a Camille can wrong now you cannot a

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:43,190
latency is down to that 2.6 of new

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,760
second male second is it reduce a little

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,549
bit

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,510
so last kids are we enabled romaji

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:54,320
and is our completed a traumatic kernel

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:57,230
and it further reduce that kind of

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,760
latency by replacing that belong to that

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:04,280
on syllable lock and then we can all up

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,590
but not all and make sure a chrono can

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,440
be preempted because I'm a low-level

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:13,030
coder you still cannot be a parameter

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,940
you can see that latency is about 150

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:20,090
151 milliseconds so on based on our test

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,790
without you can see that imagine

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,520
well burning really can work it helped

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:29,210
us reduce the latency from lat three

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:34,730
pointed sticks of milliseconds 2151

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:37,400
milliseconds but here's some tips or

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,559
some issues so some kind reported

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,110
actually observe that mmm

00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:44,720
labels out that some other areas right

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,549
and spikes on CPU to some certain

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,570
percentage like here you can see that

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:54,290
some of us be rather somebody CPU about

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:57,140
25 percent but I think they're not a

00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:00,590
problem in the Primanti in the raspberry

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:03,590
platform because I found even I don't

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,690
enable that from out here you can

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,780
further their a lot of interrupts on

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,510
that either trigger you know

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,030
Redbury path so I think reason to

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,320
imagine in a rabbit I would have that

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,120
tamartians rather because it's very

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,480
heavy

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,090
had to be handled again and again but I

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,600
wonder still here it is real another

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,800
argument between us I was robot and

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,879
contacts which in tomorrow links so

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,489
Brown links one two

00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:36,559
get that all good get that good a

00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:38,449
contact switch that mean interrupt

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,849
channel cannot be handled immediately

00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:43,809
sometime that could have big impact to

00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:46,369
that house report so how to balance that

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,619
what typically I think we have this way

00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:52,089
so I recommend and you can isolate the

00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:55,879
one CPU and then you can dedicate that

00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:58,249
interrupt release if you like here I

00:26:55,879 --> 00:27:00,829
just pressed that kind of parameter like

00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:03,739
a steep hill equivalent to the three

00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:06,109
that means the critical CPU was three is

00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:08,569
isolated from instance scheduled domain

00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:12,019
and then I dedicate a cure to that

00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:15,979
physical CPU three like this you can you

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:18,379
can see that so known as wrong at it you

00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:20,869
know cyclic a test you can see that the

00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:23,629
latency is down to that hundred or

00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:32,539
fifteen madam you second is to reduce

00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:34,969
about that such millisecond so uh okay

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:38,149
it's called well that's the part on the

00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:41,029
map so this round official plans just be

00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:43,219
a Creech to the last week's go so we

00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:45,829
have a more work to do we needed to test

00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:48,589
that the ball platform and we have

00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:51,469
another run more tests here as either

00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:53,809
run some sort of a sanity test and opt B

00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:56,779
and I'm pinching the products to make it

00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:59,389
further to our a crunch stable and again

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,829
we needed to that spark of energy so so

00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:03,589
far that the railway links doesn't

00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:06,229
suppose that I have energy but this is a

00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:08,509
good feature to that if you have one who

00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:11,389
carries a a good performance in term of

00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,279
providing links analysis about what

00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,829
relation you know

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,449
Robert Pressley is based on her it's

00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:19,429
based on V Armavir

00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:23,149
it it had at a virtual Asian excitation

00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:26,929
so you cannot people have rather you can

00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:28,969
run at a multiple cast whereas so this

00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:31,549
is really another my interest that's

00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:34,999
real time modulation I think this a good

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:36,919
kiss to that algae because what relation

00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:39,529
can help us address some challenges in

00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,889
the case of algae like isolation and

00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:44,340
that security issue and that

00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:47,440
consolidation

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,419
and that's the I trying to do I'm trying

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,639
to do it in the future is at Union ink

00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:54,580
these are another exploration about the

00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:55,960
Union Colonel I'm not sure I've gotta

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,610
have heard that you need colonel

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,159
so you colonel is that a special light

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:06,580
Cinco address cannot meet machine median

00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,279
construct by the using lab over labor OS

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,820
single dry wage labor is so most times

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:16,149
it's just kind of wrong run process but

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:19,299
we have a lot of existing unique kernel

00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:22,019
but that doesn't succeed them so why is

00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:24,370
it existing you can have yet a get

00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,350
popularity I think they have been some

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,630
challenging so you my unique I know

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,029
explosion I find to convert links

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,510
through that you Nakano like a unique

00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:36,639
honor links to dress this a problem I

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:41,700
have that a simple POC but it's over the

00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:41,700
x86 I want to bring this to that arm

00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:49,139
it's my president it's just a small

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,139
story so if you have a question

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,900
all right okay

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,870
for a lot of your test results you were

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,820
saying you were showing the maximum

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,850
latency that you were getting and it was

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,790
quite a dramatic drop but did you also

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,800
characterize the latency jitter or you

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:53,270
know how how often you were getting that

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:58,490
say 114 estimate

00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:00,890
I'm not tested but I guess you can find

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,960
some tests without them before Latin so

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,820
my work is trying to integrated that

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,680
primarily is the to that official branch

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,650
but before that I think a lot together

00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,250
already did some evaluation tests based

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,590
on the Raspberry Pi and Aaron Ellingson

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:58,480
you can find some readouts so PI I think

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:58,480
there should be good why not

00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:12,770
what's the special problem specific

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,080
value

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:38,810
so what's your question sorry I got your

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:59,250
question is what specific issue which

00:32:38,810 --> 00:33:22,590
can potentially some race conditions are

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:27,830
cheaper sure what I did

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,830
evolution test I just actually sorry oh

00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:38,820
so what I did in my evolution test

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,760
easily the physical CPU sorry

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,460
then I dedicated that in the Raptor you

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,270
has been rapid cos 2 3

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,700
this can make sure that your interrupts

00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,730
can be handled in the Philippine

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,990
immediately without any new infection

00:33:53,730 --> 00:34:00,930
I mean so but your article is based on a

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:05,160
cyclic test each policy is do trying to

00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,700
asylum educated across the for CPU from

00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:11,000
sipuel

00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,000
0 to sub u sorry is average

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:31,300
so they tell Ben that the physical abuse

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,300
we had that minimal that latency

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,090
and question

00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:56,600
so so if we're know for the question and

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,600
thank you a guy all right

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,929
