	Preempt-RT Raspberry Pi Linux - Tiejun Chen, VMware

 As we known, the Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. now it is very popular around our IoT world, and you can see many guys use Pi to build great things, and even it can play a role in the production environment. The official Raspberry Pi Linux, https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux, maintain Linux kernel specific to Pi platform. But it does not including Preempt RT Linux support. Obviously, in some IoT cases we really need to meet hard real time requirement. In this presentation, we will review if-how can integrate Preempt RT Linux patches to Pi Linux, including what are those problems for this particular hardware platform.
