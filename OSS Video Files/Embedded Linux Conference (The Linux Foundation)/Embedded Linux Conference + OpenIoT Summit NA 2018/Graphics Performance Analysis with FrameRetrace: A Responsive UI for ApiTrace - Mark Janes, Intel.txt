	Graphics Performance Analysis with FrameRetrace: A Responsive UI for ApiTrace - Mark Janes, Intel

 FrameRetrace is the first fully open-source graphics performance analysis tool for OpenGL on Linux platforms. This talk will describe the current state of FrameRetrace, and why it is a compelling tool for OpenGL application and driver developers. A demo of FrameRetrace will illustrate and fix a performance problem in the mesa driver.

The following live experiments allow a developer to alter the frame and immediately see the impact on both performance and rendering:

shader editing and recompilation
changes to GL state settings
changes to uniforms values

Because FrameRetrace is built on top of ApiTrace, it can analyze most OpenGL applications. It can also provide parallel analysis of the same frame on Windows and Linux platforms, to highlight driver differences.

About Mark Janes
Since 2011, Mark has been working on graphics performance analysis tools, including FrameRetrace, which enables rapid performance and debugging on top of ApiTrace. He also implemented and maintains the i965 Mesa Continous Integration system, dramatically improving the velocity and quality of Intel's Mesa team. Before joining Mesa, Mark worked on Intel's widely used Graphics FrameAnalyzer for DX (https://software.intel.com/en-us/gpa/graphics-frame-analyzer). The FrameRetrace use cases are based on FrameAnalyzer.

Before joining Intel Mark implemented the industry-leading real-time distributed audio platform for commercial installations (http://biamp.com/products/tesira).
