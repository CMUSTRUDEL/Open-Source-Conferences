Description: 
	System-in-Package Technology: Making it Easier to Build Your Own Linux Computer - Erik Welsh, Octavo Systems & Jason Kridner, BeagleBoard.org

Now even novices to hardware can build a Linux computer, right at the custom PCB level, enabling you to define your own peripherals, features and form-factor to meet your precise computing needs. Fit a computer into a tiny IoT container or put hundreds of computers on a single board with System-in-Package technology! SiP also eliminates huge chunks of software debug time and removes the need to customize the boot configuration or device tree to get started doing development with a working kernel. Erik Welsh will walk through how SiP integrates heterogeneous processors, memory, and power under one easy to layout package and how it lowers the HW, SW and boot complexity as well as time to production. BeagleBoard.org co-founder, Jason Kridner will join to show how this technology brings building a Linux PC within reach of the larger community of embedded systems designers.
