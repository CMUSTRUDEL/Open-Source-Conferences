Description: 
	Measuring and Summarizing Latencies using the Trace Event Subsystem - Tom Zanussi, Intel

The RT-devel kernel has recently merged a patchset designed to replace the RT kernel's latency histogram feature with a new version built on top of a more generic 'inter-event' facility. This new 'inter-event' capability in turn builds on the general-purpose Trace Event subsystem, and is expected to be merged into the mainstream kernel at some point.

This presentation will describe the new capabilities from a set of real-world examples all the way down to the 'bare metal' of the event subsystem. It will also discuss how these new inter-event capabilities can be used with other tracing facilities, and will cover possible future tasks that can/should be done to up-level and in turn build further on this work.
