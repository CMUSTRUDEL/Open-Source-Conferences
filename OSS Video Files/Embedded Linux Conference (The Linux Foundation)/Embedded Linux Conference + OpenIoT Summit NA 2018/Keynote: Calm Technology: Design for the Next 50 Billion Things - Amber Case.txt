	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
hello good morning it's nice to be here

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,830
I spend half my time in Boston and half

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,809
my time here so it's nice to be back my

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,309
name is Amber case I'd like you know

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,289
could you just hold up all your phones

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,420
really quickly I think you won you're

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,220
the fastest one so the idea is that

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,710
you're all cyborgs but some of you are

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,480
more reluctant cyborgs than others and

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,220
you don't have to have anything it's

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,680
taller than you to be a cyborg the term

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,320
cyborg actually came from a 1960 paper

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,170
on space travel and the definition is an

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,760
organism to which exotic data to which

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,860
external components have been added for

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,750
the purpose of adapting to new ambient

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,750
spaces the whole idea of a cyborg is

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,480
space travel so that you can adapt as a

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,129
human to places that humans shouldn't

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,739
really go and they aren't able to

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,140
survive in and so I I got my start

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,969
studying what it means to be a cyborg

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,250
and what it means to wake up next to a

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,140
phone before your loved one in the

00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,430
morning and have a device that cries and

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,940
you have to pick it up and soothe it

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,930
back to sleep or turns against you if if

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,510
you don't upgrade it fast enough along

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,820
the way I was studying cell phones in

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,150
2007 when I was writing my thesis I

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,950
wanted to do something in the nearer the

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,900
same location in anthropology you

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,939
usually go to these other countries and

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,710
study other people this idea of

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,049
anthropological other notes and you say

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,270
oh how interesting their rituals are how

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,329
curious their tools are in the entire

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,070
time you forget that you are the weird

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,009
person you're the one that you might

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,500
want to study because now just 15 years

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,970
ago we didn't have these little clicky

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,520
devices that we were dealing with all

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,259
the time so I went around San Francisco

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,420
and I watched people put their dog on

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,860
pause as they were walking it on the

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,140
street so they could answer a text

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,759
message I just pretty much looked weird

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,369
with like a little clipboard writing

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,810
down what people wrote and a lot of

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,759
people in my class said why are you

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,170
studying cellphones it's not really a

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,060
big deal why are you studying social

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,340
media and I said well one day everybody

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,530
will have one of these and the world

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,350
will have changed and we won't really

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,090
notice it as much and along the way I

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,280
found this concept called calm

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,050
technology and I found all these

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,060
different quotes one quote that

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,460
I like to quote as this 50 billion

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,980
devices will be online by 2020 it

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,990
depends on what you call a device of

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,210
what you call online but we're on our

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,370
way to having many many more connected

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,980
devices than ever before but usually

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,350
this quote is given at conferences where

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,580
chip manufacturers just want to make

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,530
sure that we put more chips in

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,810
everything without the consequences and

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,310
it's usually exciting but anytime

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,960
somebody gives a quote like this I like

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,880
to ask whether this sounds good or not

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,070
let's consider the things that we

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,570
already have in our lives when the smart

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,640
watches first came out they just

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,380
replicated all of the notifications you

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,090
already had on your phone so you had to

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,120
change them and it's nice if you have

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,710
like an IRC or like a slack alert but

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,300
people were just doing panicked because

00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,370
they were getting doubled notifications

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,170
and if you've forgotten to bring your

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,090
phone you probably have the phantom ring

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,350
or buzz in your pocket anyway where you

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,250
think somebody's trying to get in touch

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,040
with you

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,840
this plus your wrist or all of these

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,940
companies kept trying to there was a

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,650
whole year where lots of different

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,420
device manufacturers tried to get me to

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,040
make these smart fridges they said we

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,230
want to make a smart fridge and I said

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,750
can't we have smarter people not smarter

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,220
devices like why do we need to have a

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,020
smart fridge and they said well you

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,550
could have a payment plan where it'll

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,660
lock you out if you've eaten too many

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,280
sweets and I said okay I store my sweets

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,900
in the dumb cupboard not in the smart

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,450
fridge I don't have to worry about this

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,220
at all or the idea that will tell you

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,440
when the bananas have gone that the

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,290
bananas have appeal it changes color I

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,239
know when it's bad I don't need $100,000

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,739
worth of technology to tell me that plus

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,300
a start-up in the background that's only

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,130
going to have funding for two years and

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,390
then go away and then my fridge will be

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,900
bricked and I won't be able to use it

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,040
anymore when you put all this together

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,070
you get what I like to call the

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,450
dystopian kitchen of the future

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,850
this is what it's like to program right

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,740
now right I mean everything's written in

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,360
a different language not all of its

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,980
really documented there's open source

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,940
that's exciting and some that's not

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,500
anymore

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,600
a bunch of employees want the new

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,060
language some people don't people leave

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,550
they don't leave behind anything they

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,630
expect you to maintain it half of its

00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,610
hackable

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,380
I can imagine your teapot getting hacked

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,940
and then that gets your password I think

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,560
on the Samsung fridges apologies of

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,810
Samsung as a sponsor but on one of the

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,000
Samsung fridges you can use it to get

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,740
somebody's gmail password which is kind

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,330
of a cool idea so you all you have to do

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,270
is walk into their house and got your

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,650
email but there have been times in which

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,660
these things have failed already and

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,730
this just increases the surface area for

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,080
attack I don't know about you but I

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,850
don't want to have to be a system

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,890
administrator to live in my own home I

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,610
actually just want to go home and have

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,110
an enjoyable time this you know for

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,490
those of you who have pets you probably

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,290
have an automated pet feeder when you

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,900
leave and the ones that are attached to

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,210
a wall and set on a timer they're pretty

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,740
reliable but this startup called pet net

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,990
they said we'll go one step further

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,540
we'll make it so that you can Skype your

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,000
pets too so you can feed them water them

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,530
and Skype them and check in on them so

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,620
what do you think happened with this

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,070
startup so of course the server went

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,770
down and these connected pets they

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,090
people didn't really know what was going

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,500
on they didn't know how long the server

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,660
would be down for there was kind of a

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,350
Twitter update that said sorry our

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,660
servers are down so people had left if

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,490
people said the web site said you can

00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,900
leave your pets you can Skype them you

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,430
could check in on them never worry about

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,990
your pets again and then a couple weeks

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,790
later oh no everyone's worrying about

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,680
their pets they're breaking into their

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,830
own houses calling their spouses can you

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,020
somehow go back from vacations and

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,730
things like that so well this makes

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,650
sense I mean if if on the cover on the

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,300
cover there's no box cover anymore but

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,400
on the site it says that you don't have

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,560
to worry do you really have to worry so

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,620
I went in the Terms of Service and it

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,990
says you agree that you will not rely on

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,280
the services for any safety or critical

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,510
purposes related to you or your pet and

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,740
this is not intended to be a hundred

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:13,860
percent reliable

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,280
so where's the where's the consequences

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,840
so then I tweeted at them I said so that

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,080
the one thing that you were supposed to

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,730
do you didn't do and they said yeah well

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,890
we didn't implement offline support that

00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:30,870
was in the bug tracking system this is

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,670
what I'm concerned about in the rush to

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,320
just get everything out and it's not

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,060
usually developers fault it's it's

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,710
really their managers and bosses or the

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,750
marketers say you have to make the

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,160
product you have to to get it out we

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,510
don't care about code debt we don't even

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,760
know what that is well it'll just we'll

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,470
just throw it out it'll be fine

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,650
then these things fail and as we get

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,540
closer and closer as cyborgs to having

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,100
these functions support our day to day

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,780
when things fail it's catastrophic so we

00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,100
have an era of interruptive technology

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,020
it's not just interruptive and that

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,630
we're getting text messages all the time

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,110
and robotic notifications but we're also

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,640
dealing with bad battery life

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,010
disconnected networks servers that go

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,560
down so how do we deal with that how do

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,420
we design technology for sub-optimal

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,070
situations instead of the perfect

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,530
situation that we design it for in the

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,850
lab so we need the opposite of what we

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,010
have right now we need a kind of calm

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,800
technology where the tech recedes in the

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,290
background of supports us to amplify our

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,900
humanists instead of just turn us into

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,060
robots as we kind of are when we yell at

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,890
Siri four or five times in a row because

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,080
some of us have a slight accent or a

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,000
lisp and it won't understand us the

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,500
first time maybe the only time a

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,230
technology understands you the first

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,270
time is in Star Trek or in films where

00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,730
they can do 40 takes and they can just

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,030
put script in and and that that

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,860
aesthetic from film is what gave us

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,690
these unrealistic expectations that

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,010
technology could understand us better

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,410
than we understand each other we don't

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,030
even understand ourselves and not to

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,040
mention the person next to us how could

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,780
technology understand us better than

00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,490
that so we have to work with the

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,670
limitations of the technology that we

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:11,310
have and make better experiences when I

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,900
was writing my thesis I found Xerox PARC

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,720
and Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,040
Mark Weiser died in 1999 but he's kind

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,660
of considered the father of ubiquitous

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,980
computing which we kind of now know as

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,930
IOT and the idea

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,090
and the research that many of these

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,200
people did is that they didn't just have

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,150
pure engineering they had

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,630
anthropologists and artists and social

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,030
scientists to to kind of balance out the

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,979
pure engineering and what they said is

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,960
that in the ins paper called the coming

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,360
age of calm technology is that in the

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,310
future the scarce resource will not be

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,260
technology technology will be incredibly

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,320
cheap scarce resource will be our

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,850
attention and how we use tech and how we

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,380
designed to handle that attention will

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,240
make or break future technologies

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,860
because we have a limit to what

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,870
attention we can have and I think that

00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,100
every day the amount of attention and

00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:03,280
information that our devices force us to

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,260
deal with is kind of akin to maybe world

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,670
war two style if you were like a general

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,960
and you were dealing with all these

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,330
information streams and having to

00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,830
coordinate them but that's a wartime

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,470
situation we're dealing with that much

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,200
information on a daily basis so how do

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,960
we kind of take our time back a little

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,560
bit so that we can think a little bit

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,330
better my favorite quotes is for Mark

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,400
Weiser he just says it's a good tool is

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,140
invisible and by invisible it's not this

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,270
invisible interface that doesn't exist

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,490
it's that good tool is invisible because

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,350
you can focus on the task not the tool

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,690
if you look at somebody that's really

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,090
great with woodworking they don't focus

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,280
on their tools and have to update the

00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,260
saw or whatever they just use the saw

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,560
and it's just an extension of their hand

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,080
it's just a tool and a book is fantastic

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,630
because the complexity is internalized

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,130
in its cover so you just close the book

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,660
and there's the complexity and then you

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,430
store it on a shelf and then if you want

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,070
the complexity you open the book back up

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,380
it's pretty stable you don't have to

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,670
worry about updating the book and it's

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,100
there and you can throw it on your shelf

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,930
and when you read a book the interface

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,880
dissolves you into it you don't even

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,890
notice that you exist anymore if it's a

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,740
good book and well-written because it's

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,900
just there so how do you design a calm

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,360
technology some of the research that

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,850
Weiser and brown did I've kind of taken

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,560
and compiled and put into a series of

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,210
principles the first one is that

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,610
technology shouldn't require all of your

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,190
attention just some of it and only when

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,560
necessary an example of this is a tea

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,150
kettle you set it you forget it you can

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,760
go into another room it'll call to you

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,580
when it's done

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,740
it's really simple and this kind of calm

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,200
technology is just there when you need

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,900
it not when you don't and it lets you

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,240
know this is part of using your

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,010
peripheral attention if you think about

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,930
technology empowering your peripheral

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,580
attention you have very high resolution

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,770
attention in front of you and you have

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,450
lower resolution attention around the

00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,190
back of your head you can hear something

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,190
in the background you can feel something

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,990
by haptics by touch how do you compress

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,790
information into those different senses

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,050
to still be attune to your environment

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,260
and get the same amount of information

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,150
but not be distracted out of it if you

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,310
think of a car everything about the car

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,780
is a tuning you to your primary focus in

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,780
front of you to drive on the road

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,100
everything else like foot pedal glancing

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,290
back and forth between the rearview

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,610
mirror that's all there is secondary and

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,230
tertiary attention to get you to focus

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,270
on that goal and to keep all the

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,420
variables of where the cars are in your

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,460
head this is a silly example but this is

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,210
the lumo back posture sensor it just

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,410
buzzes you when you're slouching

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,390
technology should inform in and calm how

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,970
do you compress some information into a

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,490
kind of ambient awareness my old

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,920
co-founder and I made this tiny hue

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,140
light bulb system is just a hue light

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,790
bulb attached to a weather report so

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,020
instead of having a disembodied computer

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,400
voice wake you up and tell you the

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,930
weather report you just walk into the

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,850
kitchen and it will just show the color

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,040
of what the temperature is going to be

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,680
like for the day so I was walking in the

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,660
kitchen this morning and it was well a

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,550
few years ago but it was a it was yellow

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,050
and I knew it was going to be sunny in

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,490
Portland and I was really excited

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,760
because most the time I wake up and it

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,770
was just be blue awful but I didn't have

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,210
to look at the weather report if I

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,710
didn't want to but you know there's just

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,570
an iPad on the wall so you can see it

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,210
any time but the idea is low resolution

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,370
then high resolution give the person a

00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,020
choice to go from low resolution to high

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,840
resolution so that they're just not

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:29,060
attacked by the information technology

00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,400
should amplify the best of what tech can

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,380
get can do and what the best of humanity

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,640
can do if you try to make a technology

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,380
that acts like a human you end up

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,470
putting humans on pause you end up

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,420
making humans act like robots I like

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,860
Google because when it first came out

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,450
people try to scroll down because they

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,740
didn't know how to use it but the idea

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,390
of Google's that's just a human

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,300
switchboard it's just connecting you to

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,190
what other people have

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,870
on the web with a bunch of bots behind

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,820
the scenes it's doing 80 90 percent of

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,290
the work for you giving you results but

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,510
you're the one that's choosing the

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,640
result it's not trying to make a choice

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,860
for you and in this way you're

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,200
collaborating with a machine side by

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,910
side you're not having the machine

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,040
choose something for you which will

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,510
almost always be wrong or if it's right

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,580
really terrifying like on Amazon this is

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,860
my friend Todd Huffman he found that all

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,470
these biologists were scanning tissue

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,970
samples by hand and they would lose

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,350
their vision over time it's a horrible

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,270
thing so he said well I'll just take

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,700
some alienware computers and make a

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,260
robot that scans the tissues and does

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,210
two-dimensional scanning with a

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,610
three-dimensional tissue sample and then

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,970
with a network of doctors and a voting

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,950
system be able to send a sample in see

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,510
whether it was cancerous or not and then

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,790
send that back to the database and that

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,740
cybernetic feedback loop not an AI not

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,110
machine learning a cybernetic feedback

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,120
loop with humans and computers was able

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,060
to be more accurate and be able to

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,760
predict cancer at larger and larger time

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,620
spans before the cancer actually hit and

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,150
that's much more interesting to me than

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,710
a closed system that you think is

00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,480
perfect you say these things are

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,060
imperfect we can improve them over time

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,510
let's make something that's not entirely

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,090
great but it will improve and even if

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,650
it's 80 90 percent it's better than what

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,650
looks like a perfect system that just

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,690
doesn't scale at all technology can

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:18,330
communicate but it doesn't need to speak

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,100
c-3po knows how many two hundred

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,390
thousand languages but he's annoying in

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,730
every single language but r2d2 just has

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,960
a language of cube beeps and you know no

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,160
matter what country you're from no

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,570
matter what background you're from no

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,180
matter what language you speak you know

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,790
exactly what r2d2 feels because you can

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,270
hear this universal tonal language when

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,790
we have devices that speak to us in a

00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,080
human language in English not only do we

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,280
have to translate them to a bunch of

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,040
different languages to ship them all

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,140
over the world but we have limitations

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,660
because we expect to be able to

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,250
communicate with the device in the same

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,980
way that it communicates with us and

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,400
that's one of the problems about having

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,529
things that speak at us this isn't an

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,749
old installation it was just a

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,790
a servomotor attached to a string and

00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,829
this would were around based on the

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,180
server activity at Xerox PARC and so if

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,189
you heard this you knew that somebody

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,839
was doing something cool and then you'd

00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,759
go run around the lab and try and figure

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,259
out what they were doing everybody was

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,490
wearing location tracking badges by the

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,009
way so you could kind of see them on a

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,379
board but it was fun it was like a

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,629
social activity and it was ridiculously

00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,889
silly but this kind of art project

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,990
because they had artists there and they

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,639
were just doing weird things was this

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,499
fun indicator of what was happening

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,569
without actually having to tell you what

00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:35,670
was happening you had to go find out and

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,370
that that created connections across

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,199
different departments the Roomba just

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,910
gives you a tone it goes to the done

00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,769
when it's done and done done when it's

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,959
stuck and you have to help it out and

00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,999
it's an awful vacuum cleaner doesn't

00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,309
even clean any of the corners but people

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,620
find it so adorable that cats right

00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:54,269
around on it and YouTube videos because

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,529
it doesn't expect to speak to you in

00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,970
this English language and it's not

00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,230
shaped like a human it's just a

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,569
trilobite filter feeder it's a

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:05,660
prehistoric device it's motorized

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:08,399
technology should consider social norms

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,829
what is a social norm well everybody in

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,660
this auditorium has a phone with a video

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:14,339
camera in it and that's normal we aren't

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,259
panicking like 15 years ago saying

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,569
privacy is dead don't point that thing

00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,129
at me what is this like we you know now

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,449
people just use cameras on their phones

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:25,740
to take pictures of their food before

00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:28,170
they eat it as a pre digestive ritual so

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,759
whatever is normal is invisible and you

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,860
have to figure out what that norm is

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,439
anything that restores you to that

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,689
invisible norm is restorative so it's

00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:38,370
like a prosthetic leg or glasses they

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:39,449
can be even decorative we don't know

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,519
that we don't look at somebody who has

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,379
glasses on and say add that's terrifying

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
but we do look at somebody with Google

00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,519
glass and say oh no the general public

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,929
does so you have to think what was the

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,819
difference between let's say Google

00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:52,769
glass and an Apple product an Apple

00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:54,120
product innovated through making a

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,339
digital walkman that you could wear that

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,839
could store more than a CD and then you

00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,819
could wear that around and eventually it

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,040
led to a touch interface and then it led

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,449
to an app store where 14-year olds could

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,459
make a fart app where you press a button

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,110
and it makes a fart sound and then that

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,360
led to dinner table discussions and

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,490
friendliness and silliness and then lots

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,870
of apps being made in the store and then

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,520
you had Google glass which one of the

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,420
only apps that came out for it that made

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,620
a lot of sense was the

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,570
link to take a photo which was

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,000
terrifying and when you release all of

00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,620
these features at the same time people

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,420
in the press usually focus on the

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,190
scariest one which is persistent video

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,170
recording which you can't do on Google

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,550
glass it makes the display really hot

00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,140
and you can't even wear it for that long

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,460
and then it runs the battery out but

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,230
tell that to the press that's not as

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,750
exciting as the world is over and

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,940
terminator glasses are here so you have

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,640
to figure out what the metabolism rate

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,710
is for the people using your technology

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,240
because people can only handle and

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,160
digest maybe one feature per year if

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,660
you're lucky like when when elevators

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,280
first came out people were terrified

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,900
that they get like compressed into like

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
a disk like this because they've never

00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,860
been accelerated that direction before

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,990
it'd be artificially slowed down and

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,070
then elevator operators were the only

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,720
people who could press the buttons

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,430
people were afraid to press the buttons

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,960
and then when the elevator operators

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,280
went on strike people realize they could

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,470
press the buttons themselves and they

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,570
wouldn't die and that's why we can press

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,700
our own buttons on the elevators this is

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,630
how long it takes for new technologies

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,040
to get into an ecosystem the right

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,840
amount of tech is the minimum to solve

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,460
the problem this is the hardest thing

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,560
especially when companies are getting so

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,750
much funding right now they're all just

00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,090
spending money on everything they can I

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,710
did a start-up a couple years ago where

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,020
we just said let's raise the least

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,380
amount of money we can we wanted to do

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,120
two we did location-based like messages

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,320
we said well we can't afford text

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
messages so we'll try this new thing

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,560
called push notifications we didn't know

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,360
how that worked so we learned how that

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,820
worked and the whole time it was just

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,090
what can we not spend money on because

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,130
each new feature each new support module

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,480
each every single thing that you do the

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,340
minute you add more things you have to

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,170
support every single one of those things

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,520
and it becomes more complex so how can

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,290
you use the least amount to get the

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,240
thing done so that lasts for a really

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,740
long time and that's hard to talk about

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,530
when everybody is trying to build things

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,300
really really quickly these are my

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,920
favorite technologies the toilet

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,140
occupied sign on a plane is like the

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,910
only sign that doesn't change because

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,680
it's a pictogram so anybody in any

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,970
language can understand it even if

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,470
you're red green colorblind you

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,410
understand because it lights up whether

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,180
its occupied or not and the the street

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,850
light is just a punctuation for reality

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,530
when we created cars and urban streets

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,340
and districts like we kind of figured it

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,930
out it's a light

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,370
indicator could you imagine making a

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,290
street light today you'd have the

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,000
Bluetooth to each intersection on your

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,220
phone and then you have to disengage and

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,900
like press 10 buttons and then it would

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,200
send you an alert that says the light is

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,030
green

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,770
you wouldn't be able to see which light

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,340
it was and like you get into it it would

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,620
be awful so technology should make use

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,540
of the NIR in the far this is my kind of

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,520
weird graph of what I think could happen

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,260
in the future if we had computing that

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,880
was really far away from us in terms of

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,680
mainframes where if you were Bill Gates

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,360
you would sneak out in the middle of the

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,210
night in high school and like try to use

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,670
your timeshare of like 3:00 a.m. to 4:00

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,900
a.m. on it and then we we had desktops

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,280
where everybody kind of had their own

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,810
terminal in their house which was a

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,610
really nice time because you didn't have

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,500
to have any web access because there

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,350
wasn't really in a web I mean you could

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,850
have a BBS system if you wanted but then

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,130
suddenly all this data started to go

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,530
away from you and to kind of like remote

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,210
mainframe cloud things like I know that

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,040
my facebook photos are stored somewhere

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,430
in The Dalles but I can't just walk

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,410
there and say hey can I have access to

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,090
my photos in the server facility they'll

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,890
kick me out and they'll report me it's

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,470
like trying to hack into their server

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,840
facility though so much of what we do

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,160
now is not with us and if you were to

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,600
put your phone on airplane mode you

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,120
probably wouldn't be able to do anything

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,820
other than like take photos and like the

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,950
notes happen maybe the audio recorder so

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,280
what I'd like to see happen is we go

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,230
back to a kind of desktop era but it's

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,210
on our devices that we use each of our

00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,520
devices as a kind of personal server so

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,200
if I go to the doctor I can say hey I'm

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,000
going to share my personal data with you

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,950
for the next 30 minutes

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,630
in order to get treatment plan and then

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,220
that data will be stored back to my own

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,200
personal server this is back to Star

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,000
Trek they off personal servers and then

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,770
if somebody hacks into that database

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,770
they're only getting the data that it's

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,110
been shared for the last 30 minutes so

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,390
it's all about decreasing the surface

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,910
area for attack and the excitement of

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,310
trying to get into this kind of iceberg

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,810
style databases not to say that this

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,030
would work there's a lot of interesting

00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,350
technologies that break bits up and

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,750
allow you to download things from other

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,330
people around you IP FS is interesting

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,910
to follow but it'd be nice to see a mix

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,290
process as much as you can on the device

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,650
itself because there's a lot of power

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,500
and that way when you're on a subway

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:47,030
you get out of cell network range you

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,550
don't have a really bad experience I

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,800
love being in carros with the Sirius FM

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,360
radio and you go into a tunnel and the

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,770
song stops because they won't even

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,170
buffer more than like three or four

00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,150
seconds so you're gonna download most of

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,310
the song anyway why not have more in the

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,350
buffer why not say that the experience

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,790
is going to be bad for most people

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,290
they're going to have a bad phone

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,200
they're going to have horrible battery

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,180
life why not make something work even

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,010
when it fails an escalator reverts to

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,810
stairs when it fails why can't our

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,180
technology when it fails degrade

00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,680
gracefully level after level so that we

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,350
can guarantee a good experience for

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,540
people it's harder to build but the

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,270
support requirements are far less if you

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,740
do it right so good design allows you to

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,720
accomplish your goals in the least

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,610
amount of moves and you try to take

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,490
those moves away until there's nothing

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,900
left to take away then a calm technology

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,770
allows you to accomplish the same amount

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,210
of goals with the least mental cost

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,620
because I don't know about you but when

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,940
we talk about automation do you want to

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,710
automate hanging out with your kids or

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,960
falling in love or getting married I

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,970
mean some of you might but the whole

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,890
idea is that we have an excess of what

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,510
the Greeks call the Cronus time it's

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,460
kind of industrial time where it's 9:00

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,530
a.m. 10 a.m. 11 a.m. everything is

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,810
structured and everything can just

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,540
interrupt you but the Greeks also had a

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,160
name for the opposite time

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,050
Kairos time and Kairos time is this

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,940
undefined time where you lose track of

00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,920
it where you go into a state of flow or

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,500
you say why was I doing that thing for

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,610
six months that was totally unnecessary

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,650
usually when you're on a vacation and

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,930
you have this epiphany and then you have

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:21,290
to go back to the work schedule so if we

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:23,690
make technology a little bit more like

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,820
what they thought of maybe at Xerox PARC

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,030
we could have some of that time back we

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:32,240
could get some Kairos time back and then

00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:34,280
we could be more intelligent instead of

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,260
having smarter technology we could have

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,180
smarter humans because the scarce

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,220
resource is our attention that's the

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,310
thing that we need to pay attention to

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,810
and conserve otherwise we'll just be

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,750
doing the same thing over and over again

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,820
with more funding and it will crash in

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,640
catastrophic ways we've never seen

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,150
before

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,620
and we'll have to clean up the mess so I

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,780
wrote a book on this called calm tech

00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,190
and I'm writing another book which is

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,500
about if you have to have audio alerts

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,240
how should you make them sound so this

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,549
is just a sequel that will come out

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,049
later this year and then I made a

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,510
website where I put together all of the

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,309
original research on calm tech it's just

00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,110
calm tech calm and it has the principles

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:14,970
there I really encourage you to read

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,570
these original research papers some of

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,940
them are from 1989-1991 and they talk in

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,540
a way that sounds just like you're

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,660
reading it today

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,800
it's really ahead of its time so thank

00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:32,059
you so much

00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,059
