Description: 
	Piece of Cake - Testing Remote Embedded Devices Made Easy Using Open-Hardware MuxPi - Paweł Wieczorek, Samsung R&D Institute Poland

 Designing custom hardware, though might seem intimidating at first, can simplify many activities. It solves certain issues, but often raises many others. Paweł will present a fresh open hardware approach at providing remote access (including device flashing, debugging and power management) to embedded devices - MuxPi (https://wiki.tizen.org/MuxPi), successor of SD MUX (https://wiki.tizen.org/SD_MUX) board (showcased during FOSDEM 2016 and Embedded Linux Conference 2016).

Presentation will also introduce components of the new Tizen GNU/Linux distribution's testing laboratory (currently in the process of being published open source):

* Boruta - board farm management system,
* Weles - LAVA-compatible testing framework,
* Perun - binary image testing system.
