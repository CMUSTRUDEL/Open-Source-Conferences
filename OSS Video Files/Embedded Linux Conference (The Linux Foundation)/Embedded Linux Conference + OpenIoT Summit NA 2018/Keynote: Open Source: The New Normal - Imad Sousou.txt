	Keynote: Open Source: The New Normal - Imad Sousou, Corporate Vice President and General Manager, Open Source Technology Center, Intel

As we move toward a world where everything is smart and connected, our experiences are becoming increasingly digitized, resulting in a massive flood of data. We are using the power of that data to transform some of the most exciting areas of human activity. Open source continues to be the driving force behind the next great wave of the technology revolution. Imad Sousou, corporate vice president and general manager of the Open Source Technology Center for Intel Corporation, will highlight how Intel has uniquely positioned to power the cloud and drive the increasingly smart, connected world.

hey good morning everyone thanks a lot

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,849
them and and thanks for the plug on

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,120
participating in in open source projects

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm gonna give just for you I'm gonna

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,260
give people a chance to participate in

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,480
two great open source projects that I'm

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,580
going to talk about this morning so good

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,850
morning everyone and I'm thrilled to be

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,640
here especially I don't have to I only

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,410
have to drive here I live in Portland so

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,840
thank you for coming and I hope you

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,820
enjoyed the sunshine yesterday we do get

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,100
much more sunshine than this but you

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,340
know and it will be I think it's gonna

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:43,680
be more sunshine this afternoon so great

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,690
to be here and and and one of the things

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,160
that the thing that I'm gonna talk about

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:55,620
today is open source and open source in

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,340
new places or what I would call open

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,530
source and new normal so when we you

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,309
know when we when we look at open source

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,340
and open source penetration it is it's

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,729
truly everywhere except in few things

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,869
that is that it's been very very

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,420
difficult to see open source end and and

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,850
these are the two areas that I'm going

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,799
to be focusing on today and some of the

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,080
when you look at when you look at things

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,909
like data center when you look at things

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,630
I like IOT embedded open sources it open

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:40,320
source is the normal you know 14 out of

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,070
the top 15 data centers on on this

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,409
planet pretty much run all open source

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,390
billions and billions of devices order

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,040
and open source but there are areas

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,500
where open source had not really been

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,960
used that much and what I want to do

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,619
today is well and what we are launching

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,380
today is are a couple of we of a couple

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:08,640
of projects and what's unique about them

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,460
is that these are areas where open

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,120
source had not been used and

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,050
for for four reasons at least reasons

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,850
that people try to use we think that

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:28,470
this glass barrier is it's the right

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,750
time to start breaking that I'm

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,890
specifically the projects I'm going to

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,140
talk about deal with with firmware and

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,130
with I'm going to talk a little bit

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,740
about our other project that deals with

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,340
safety critical systems these are things

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,680
that typically use very closed very

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,480
proprietary systems sure there is some

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,000
open source some open source base that

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,860
you people use for that but typically it

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,660
is it is closed systems so the first

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,290
project which we announced a couple of

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,170
days ago is is a hypervisor but this is

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,300
not your average hypervisor this is not

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,640
a data center hypervisor or this is not

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,280
a hypervisor that you like hey I want to

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,160
run a couple of windows guests on it

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,510
this is a hypervisor that is a very very

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,120
lightweight and is designed with it's

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,500
designed with safety critical systems in

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,730
mind so this is a hypervisor that that

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,250
we've been working on at Intel where it

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,220
is designed so that there are safety

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,190
critical domains that can run on top of

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,320
it and 950 critical domains and you'll

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,630
see a lot of usage especially in modern

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,240
computing a lot of usages in like this

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,630
with particularly around edge computing

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,700
industrial and and and automotive and

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,540
I'll talk a little bit more in a little

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,760
bit about about the the usages of of

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:05,460
this project so this project is called

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:08,670
acorn and and and it's been it's been

00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:13,260
quite a struggle quite honestly to get

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:17,040
something you know a hypervisor so thin

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,669
that it does support you know real-time

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,430
it does have all the full-featured of a

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,560
hypervisor but yet it is very very small

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,780
I think the hypervisor is

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,270
1/6 or 1/7 the size of a typical

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,630
hypervisor from from a line of code it's

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:37,449
like 25 thousand lines of code and and

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:43,389
it does one of the key aspects of it is

00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:47,229
that it does allow the mixing of safety

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:50,169
critical operating systems with with

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:53,199
just a none safety critical operating

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,060
system and and this is a major change

00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,490
because if you wanna run a safety

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:02,710
critical operating system on none on on

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,500
a virtualized in a virtualized

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,180
environment the entire chain must be

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,350
safety critical therefore you have to

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,490
have a hypervisor

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,949
that that allows you to do that

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,510
so what are the use cases for that this

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:23,800
plenty so a good example is automotive

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:29,620
so automotive in the very old world in

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:32,889
automotive you had many CPUs so you're

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,720
beginning to see consolidation of CPUs

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:39,910
where and of the infrastructure where

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,300
where you do have software-defined

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:47,440
infrastructure in the car so you could

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,580
have so a typical configuration you

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,010
would have your instrument cluster

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,669
running on one operating system your

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,919
infotainment system would be running on

00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:59,260
on a different operating system your

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,550
navigation would be running as another

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,130
guest and some of these can be critical

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,110
systems that really really need to

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,780
adhere it would be a critical system

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:14,500
operating system that that is needs to

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,270
be certified as such and and some of

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,220
them obviously you have some tolerance

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,949
as a normal operating system

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,840
so what acorn does it gives you the

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,520
infrastructure to create that

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,620
software-defined infrastructure and

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,440
something like a car whether you are

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,139
able to run safety critical systems and

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,160
non safety critical systems on one

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,080
hypervisor that is you that is

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,700
that operates in that real-time

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,870
environment and so on

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:47,100
so we're very very excited about this a

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,860
corn was just launched so you can learn

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,530
much more about it in the Intel booth

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,670
and obviously just go on the website

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:59,310
project a corn that.org and and if you

00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,140
want a project with you there is lots

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,840
and lots of room to be a subsystem

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,720
maintainer I mean there's so many pieces

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,140
to the to the a cone project if you if

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,940
you want a project that is exciting

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:17,820
modern new please I encourage you to you

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,360
know to participate and and and

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,280
contribute and as Tim said you know hey

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,170
you want to be try out maintainer ships

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,060
you know we have a place for you

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:34,200
probably here ok so let me talk about

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,290
the second project that we that we just

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,690
launched today and and and I want to

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,430
talk about the story of the project you

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:46,500
know these are a couple of Intel

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:48,900
engineers Liam and Keon and and the

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,520
story I don't know how many I don't know

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,490
how many of you are familiar with the

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,350
Intel minnowboard it's the open source

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,100
open source hardware that we've

00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:04,880
developed and and it's been used you

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:08,010
know you know reasonably and one of the

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,310
objectives that we've had in the open

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:15,270
source group at Intel is that we really

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,100
had the desire that everything on that

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:22,830
board everything that we run on the

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:26,730
mineral board is open-source and and we

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:31,860
were almost there except one thing the

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:37,800
some pieces of firmware and and here on

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:41,070
and Liam finally decided that okay we're

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,000
not we will have the entire thing as

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:48,030
open-source and the big piece that was

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,810
not open source is the entire change of

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,040
the chain

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:56,060
audio and voice and and this is when

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,460
they just went in and like you know

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,300
hacked and hacked and hacked and came up

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,740
with an open completely cleared room

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,680
open source audio and this is by the way

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,950
this is an intel part this is like so

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,170
and there is just like any piece of

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,900
hardware there is a proprietary firmware

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,270
and along with a quote a firmware

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,960
developer kit that allows customers to

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:26,390
customize the firmware and so on so so

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:30,720
what they would they came up with is is

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:33,360
an entire open source firmware stack

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,440
including the firmware itself the

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,440
drivers tools imaging tools emulators

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,600
for debug the entire thing is open

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,870
source and this is truly an open

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:52,440
frontier it's an open frontier in terms

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:55,589
of our having an area that's typically

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,160
been entirely proprietary at least the

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:01,920
firmware parts and below and and it's

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,170
always been difficult for people who

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,210
build systems to deal with any kind of

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:13,860
customization because of the proprietary

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,500
nature of a flow level firmware so so

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,470
what these guys are created and you know

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,339
what a lot of our partners by the way

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,230
completely jumped on you know obviously

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,070
this is now being launched by Intel and

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:35,040
Google when when a lot of our partners

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:38,810
started seeing what we're doing in in

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,060
sound open firmware really they started

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,690
innovating in ways that we never knew

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,660
and the the the amazing thing about it

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,029
is that how fast this progressed from a

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,010
couple of engineer hacking to create a

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,310
firmware to a full-featured

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:59,070
stack and to a that is actually four

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,730
features with you know with all the

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,080
noise cancellation noise

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,080
you know all the features that you would

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,420
expect from an entire audio stack plus a

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,640
very very easy way to customize it

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,340
without having the need for all these

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,460
complicated furthermore developers get

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,800
that typically only like very deep

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,250
experts would know would know how to use

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,230
it so again you know you want cool

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,150
maintainer ships we have them for you

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,790
and sound open framework there is lots

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,800
of part and sound open firmware that you

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,690
know that the small team of engineers

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,790
that's currently working on it from

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,640
Intel and from our partners like Google

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,310
you know that are working on it I think

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,970
it is probably one of the most exciting

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:48,300
areas to start seeing open source you

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:51,680
know go down to firmware and and it

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:55,470
would be great to see you know a

00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:02,100
firmware that is moving towards open

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:06,060
source so you know again what I would

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:09,210
like to close with is that you know we

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,430
are I think that with these two projects

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:16,170
we are beginning to break a glass

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:19,260
ceiling and of the safety critical

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,690
nature safety critical type software

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,270
with what we are doing with with acorn

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,520
and I think you will start seeing from

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,870
us and hopefully from many others you

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:34,170
know more safety critical systems and

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,140
system software becoming developed in

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,900
open source and and obviously we would

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,780
love to see more and more open source

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,270
firmware would love for all of you to

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,690
start participating and you know lots of

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:51,410
material on these two projects at the

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,579
Intel booth thank you very much

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,530
[Applause]

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,720
a face

00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,720
