	Tips for Writing Good Tests for Linux - Tim Bird, Sony

As maintainer of the Fuego test framework, I see lots of bad tests. The goal of this talk is to help you write tests that are more robust, easier to automate, and shareable with others in the Open Source community.

This talk will review and compare different test writing frameworks, including kselftest, LTP, and Fuego, and describe each one's strengths and weaknesses. A basic introduction to writing a test in each one will be given.

This talk will present tips for writing good individual tests, including which framework to use, what the test output should be, how to deal with test dependencies, how to make the test results more analyzable and usable, and other practical issues.

Following these tips should help you improve your own QA efforts. But my hidden agenda is to get you to write tests that I can use in my own Linux projects.
