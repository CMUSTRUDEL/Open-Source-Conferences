 In the last few years Arduino has revolutionised the relationship between people and electronics enabling many who thought they could never build electronic devices to unleash their creativity producing fascinating projects, products and in many cases even companies

During his keynote Massimo will explain how the Arduino founders "love for Linux" and opensource influenced many of the choices since the inception of the project and up to the latest innovations in Arduinoâ€™s hardware, software and cloud.

He will also show some of the projects Arduino is working on to bring a touch simplicity to the world of embedded linux, aiming at enabling even more people to build sophisticated IoT projects.
