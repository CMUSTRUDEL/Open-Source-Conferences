Description: 
	SCHED_DEADLINE: It's Alive! - Juri Lelli, ARM Ltd.

After deadline scheduling for processes (SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling policy) has been merged in the Linux kernel in Mar-2014 (version 3.14) a considerable effort has been put into actively maintaining it, but no further development really happened after that date - until now!

In this presentation, Juri Lelli, after giving a (very briefly) review of the current set of features, will deep dive into the details of all the new features currently under development: CPU capacity and clock frequency scaling, bandwidth reclaiming, coupling with clock frequency selection and cgroups support.

He will then conclude the presentation reviewing the list of open problems and (extremely cool) desired features - who knows if he can attract even more willing developers?! For the moment, credits go to the collaborative effort between ARM, Luca Abeni and Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna of Pisa.
