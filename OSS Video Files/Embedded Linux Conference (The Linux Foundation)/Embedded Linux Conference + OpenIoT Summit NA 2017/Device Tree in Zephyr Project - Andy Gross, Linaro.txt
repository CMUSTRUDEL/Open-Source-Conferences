	Device Tree in Zephyr Project - Andy Gross, Linaro

SoC Vendors, board vendors, software middle layers, scripting languages, all need to have access to system configuration information (pin mixes, what sensors are on a system, what amount of memory, flash, and so forth). We need a means to convey this in a vendor neutral mechanism but also one that is friendly for Cortex-M/constrained footprint devices. In addition, many SoC vendors already have their own code generation tools that could generate device tree information. So why not leverage that to simplify the board configuration and device initialization.

This session will discuss the topic with regards to Zephyr, what changes have been made to integrate device tree into Zephyr, how this impacts the way system configuration is done, what additional changes we see needed for Zephyr, and the progress on a common definition format and tooling associated with it.

About Andy Gross
I work for Linaro as a kernel developer. My current project is IOT related , specifically to improve board configuration in Zephyr. I am the current Linux kernel maintainer for the Qualcomm SoC.
