Playlist: Embedded Linux Conference + OpenIoT Summit NA 2017
Description: 
	Moving from IoT to IIoT with Maker Boards, Linux, and Open-source Software Tools - Matt Newton, Opto 22

In this session, developers will learn how to use the open-source tools, maker boards, and technology they're already familiar with to develop applications that have the potential to deliver a massive positive impact on society. There are billions of devices--sensors, I/O, control systems, motors, pumps, drives--siloed behind proprietary control and information systems, waiting to be tapped into. This workshop is geared towards teaching the developer community how to use the tools theyâ€™re already familiar with to access, monitor, and manage these assets to create a potentially huge positive impact on our way of life.

come on here we're back there okay great

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,580
so I think we'll get started today so

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,130
thanks for joining here today at the

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,559
open IOT summit workshop this is my I

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,170
think third time speaking at a Linux

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,090
Foundation event or node.js Foundation

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,510
event and I always get a kick out of

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,670
these kind of events because I come from

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,470
the industrial automation space and so a

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,970
lot of the technology that we present at

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,490
these events is totally new to the

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,740
developer community and it's really cool

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,030
to see a lot of the new ideas that the

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,860
developer community the Linux community

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,950
comes up with when they look at the

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,800
technology that we work with and so one

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,300
of the prevailing themes or ideas out

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,820
there right now that just about

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,289
everybody in there and their sister is

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,539
talking about is this whole Internet of

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,420
Things concept and that's what we're

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,829
gonna be focusing on today now a lot of

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,110
people talk about the Internet of Things

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,399
if you're from Germany or you talk to

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,250
folks in Germany they're talking about

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,800
industry 4.0 if you're the industrial

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,719
space like I am we're talking about the

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,489
industrial Internet of Things but

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,560
they're all basically the same thing and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,840
there's a lot of activity around it so

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,299
to start us off I thought I'd kind of

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,950
walk us through some of the applications

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,060
that I'm seeing come out of the Internet

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,740
of Things right now because there's a

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,689
lot of cool stuff going on so for

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,000
example this is a smart connected

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,909
refrigerator this is an absolutely

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,650
amazing piece of technology ten years

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,869
ago this would have cost an absolute

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,430
fortune but today you can pick one of

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,430
these things up for the small price of

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,710
about four to five thousand dollars it's

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,390
just about any Best Buy the thing's

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,040
absolutely amazing though especially for

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,900
that price point it's got all kinds of

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,180
sensors built into it it's got Internet

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,619
connectivity built into it it's talking

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,270
to the cloud and doing things like

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,950
predictive analytics on when you're

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,390
gonna run out of milk to make sure that

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,220
you always have milk for your cereal in

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,280
the morning which is an absolutely

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,509
amazing thing this particular smart

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,979
refrigerator though and I'm sure

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,430
everyone here has seen the commercial

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,399
for it it takes it a step further has an

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,500
IP camera built into the refrigerator

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,170
which is a great feature right because

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,879
if you're at the supermarket and you

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,289
can't remember if you have eggs in your

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,319
refrigerator you can pull out your

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,969
smartphone open up the app login your

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,890
later and actually see in real time

00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,560
what's going on inside your refrigerator

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,609
which is great because sometimes your

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,959
vegetables don't get along with your

00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,400
fruits you got to get in there you got

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,040
to break the two up before somebody gets

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,859
physically hurt but absolutely amazing

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,319
technology this is another one I've seen

00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:33,719
a lot about this is the smart connected

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,549
BBQ this thing is absolutely amazing as

00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,680
well because it's a really good idea to

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,480
be able to light your barbecue when no

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,819
one's around like let's say I get home I

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,590
feel like having a barbecue at the

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,540
airport I can open up my app and I can

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,280
start the fire when no one's at home in

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,099
my house but the point is it's

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,389
absolutely amazing technology right not

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,449
necessarily a good idea to start a fire

00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,430
when no one's around this one though I

00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:58,109
picked one of these up I just found out

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,129
recently that I'm gonna have my first

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:04,169
baby so I'm pretty excited about that

00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:07,109
but I thought I'd get in shape you know

00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,579
drop a few pounds picked up one of these

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,379
things connected it to my home network

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,900
and saw the app the thing is an absolute

00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,209
spam machine hit direct messages me on

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,430
Twitter and endorses my LinkedIn profile

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,979
it likes posts it sends me all kinds of

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,819
notifications about dietary supplements

00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,379
it's an absolute spam box but when we

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,909
take a step back and we look at this

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,250
Internet of Things technology it's

00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,470
absolutely amazing stuff right we get

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,359
smart connected scales we can light

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,489
fires when nobody's around and hopefully

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,650
not burn the house down and we can see

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,290
what's going on inside our refrigerator

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,519
from wherever we are so let's stop right

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,750
there because that is not what we're

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,479
going to be talking about today

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,009
definitely not consumer level devices

00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,519
there's a lot of buzz around the whole

00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,739
Internet of Things concept IOT but I

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,169
think we're missing a much bigger

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,799
opportunity and that's what we're gonna

00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:00,180
be focusing in focusing on today so

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,099
we're going to be talking about taking a

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,810
lot of the technology that the Linux

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,269
community is familiar with like maker

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,639
boards and open technology and standards

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,280
and we're going to talk about how we can

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,099
apply those pieces of technology to

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,719
industrial great systems and what value

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,729
we might be able to get out of doing

00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,259
that because I think that's how we're

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:20,669
going to build the real Internet of

00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,440
Things or at least the real Internet of

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:26,219
Things that I think the majority of us

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,160
want to actually get to so my name is

00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:28,720
Matt Newton

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm the director of technical marketing

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,460
for an industrial automation company

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,110
named opto 22 we have a booth here at

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,030
the show we're the ones with the big

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,520
white wind turbine if you haven't seen

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,870
us yet spinning around and we're gonna

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,580
talk a little bit more about that today

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,470
but three key ideas we're going to cover

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,630
today is I think there's a much larger

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,150
opportunity out there that we can all

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,470
start tapping into we're going to talk a

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,990
little bit about the differences between

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,640
industrial systems and consumer systems

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,590
from a design perspective from a

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,930
technology perspective from an

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,850
application perspective because while

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,620
there are some similarities and a lot of

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,630
opportunities for more getting more

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,180
value out of these types of applications

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,010
there's some pretty big differences also

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,870
and then finally we're gonna get into

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,970
the nitty-gritty on what I think the

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,860
developer community needs actually start

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,540
porting some of this technology over so

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,690
that we can get more and more value out

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,830
of these kinds of applications so to

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,900
make sure we're on the same page because

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,340
I come from the industrial space a lot

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,470
of people are here from the Linux space

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,150
or the open source space I thought we

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,160
should get on the same page about a few

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,840
definitions because people throw around

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,880
this term you know Internet of Things

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,650
thing all the time

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,020
but what the hell is an Internet of

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,170
Things thing what exactly is it it's

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,910
such a you know nebulous term but if you

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,169
look at it and you boil it down and yes

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,960
I do realize that the nest thermostat

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,520
shows up in every single IOT

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,010
presentation but there's a good reason

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,860
for that if you boil it down

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,840
IOT devices all of them have three key

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,760
and very important characteristics built

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,010
into them they have the ability to sense

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,160
the world around them they communicate

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,200
using standard internet protocols maybe

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,030
even programming languages and they have

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,340
the ability to control something in the

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,460
real and physical world so they sense

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,800
they communicate and they control just

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,270
like that nest thermostat so it's

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,650
installed in my hallway I have one of

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,970
these things I love it I paid way too

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,760
much money for it but it's still very

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,010
cool piece of cabinetry but it's got

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,260
some sensing built into it it knows if

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,419
I'm in the house with its motion sensor

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,120
if I walk past it it's got a temperature

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,190
sensor built into it and it uses that

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
information to communicate over the

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,320
Internet to talk to the nest cloud and

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,330
figure out what temperature does map

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,740
like the house set at

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,720
if it figures out that the temperature

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,729
is outside of that set point that I've

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,060
configured it performs some type of

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,129
control so it'll flip on my air

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,229
conditioning system or my heater using

00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,000
an electrical signal so this technology

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,069
is out there we're using it all over the

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,960
place today but that's an Internet of

00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,090
Things device at least for this

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,650
presentation it senses it communicates

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,759
and it controls something in the real

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,129
world so what is a legacy device and

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,050
we'll get into why legacy devices are

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,550
the massive brownfield opportunity

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,009
that's in front of us all right now that

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,569
we can tap into a legacy device is

00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,460
something that's been installed for

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:21,330
years years and years probably decades

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,770
think about how long we've been building

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,750
shipping and installing devices that are

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,009
powered by electricity so there's all

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,449
these things that are out there they're

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,190
sitting there they still have a lot of

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,569
value built into them they're probably

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,520
still performing the tasks that they

00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,190
were designed for but they were design

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,139
ruled out shipped way before this whole

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,240
Internet of Things concept came about so

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,860
they don't have connectivity built into

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,229
them no internet connectivity but

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,020
there's still a lot of value in them so

00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:49,330
third definition what is a control

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,340
system does anybody in here know what a

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,460
control system is industrial control

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,219
system feedbacks a good one but let's

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,180
keep it simple for the purposes of

00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,740
presentation so if you think about your

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,680
car when you're driving down the road

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,750
you hit the desired speed that you want

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,279
your automobile to travel you push the

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,949
button on the side of the steering wheel

00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,469
and the cars cruise control system takes

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,029
over now the system inside the car is

00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:15,370
going to monitor how fast that car is

00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:18,310
traveling and if it gets above or below

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,319
the configured setpoint or speed that

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,810
you want the car to travel at it

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,789
controls some type of input right so we

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,919
apply the gas to speed up we apply the

00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,419
brakes to slow down that's the basics of

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,699
a control system we configure it's that

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:31,870
point and then it runs to make sure that

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,849
that setpoint stays where it's supposed

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,649
to do and if it doesn't it does things

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,469
to take over and bring it back to that

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,120
setpoint so control systems are used all

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,130
over the place this building right now

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,949
has a control system to run the HVAC

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,140
system we use them in manufacturing we

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,240
use them in process control reason for

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,829
cool stuff like making beer running

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,630
nuclear power plants they get used all

00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,930
over the place we've been shipping stuff

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,260
like this for years and years

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,510
yours okay definitions out of the way

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,430
that's the boring part let's get back to

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,800
the fun stuff the maker boards so

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,899
recently I started screwing around with

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,730
raspberry pi boards and they are super

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,459
cool the amount of computing power in

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,060
these things is absolutely amazing so

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:14,240
originally they were designed for

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,070
software education they're making

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
inventors and tinker's out of just about

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,899
anybody that has $35 to pick up a

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,480
Raspberry Pi personally I have one at

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,670
work I used to be in the IT space so I

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,050
screw around a lot with trying to break

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,490
into our wireless network at work

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,740
because that's fun for me it's what I

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,140
like to do I was amazed that this thing

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,520
actually has a full-blown Kali Linux you

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,839
know security penetration testing

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,230
distribution available for it that I

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
could just download slam on it and go so

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,290
lots of cool things going on with the

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,540
Raspberry Pi and the maker board

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,730
community I saw this one on the Internet

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,860
I thought it was funny it's an automated

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,750
dog watering system which is great make

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,720
sure Fido has always got fresh clean

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,130
water available all powered by I can't

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,410
remember if it was a pie or an hour do

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,209
we know but this is another one that I

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,200
thought was pretty cool and kind of goes

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,570
along with what we're talking about

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,950
today so to date myself and I can't

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,240
believe I'm RT at the point where I have

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,180
to worry about dating myself

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,589
that's a gameboy video game system so I

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,320
had one of those when I was a kid

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,360
of course it's long since died it's

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,279
probably in the landfill somewhere but

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,110
this person took their old legacy piece

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,020
of video game equipment with the

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,670
Raspberry Pi just basically breathed new

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,550
life into that old piece of equipment

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,660
all using new computing technology and

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,260
that's kind of what we're gonna be

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,820
talking about today again going back to

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,380
the bigger opportunity so I have to ask

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,720
myself

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,279
we've got like 10 million raspberry pies

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,020
that have shipped that's just the pie so

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,029
I think they're probably closer to like

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,440
11 million by now but if you think about

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,000
all of the engineers out there the

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,110
talent the software engineers the

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,310
hardware engineers that are out there

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,680
you know having a blast putting together

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,810
automatic dog watering systems I gotta

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,360
wonder if that huge pool of talent if we

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,100
took it and we directed it at much

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,200
larger scale applications maybe

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,329
industrial applications what kind of

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,329
value could we get out of doing that now

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,400
to illustrate my point and remember

00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:08,960
we're in industrial automation company

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,360
I thought I'd walk us through a quick

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,830
case study and this one was pretty cool

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
as soon as I found out about this story

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,310
I got incredibly jazzed because I've

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,890
been waiting for people to start doing

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,320
this kind of stuff for five or ten years

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,360
it all starts around California's green

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,610
grid now in California if you take a

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,490
trip back in time with me say 30 or 40

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,400
years ago pollution was a huge problem

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,410
like my dad was growing up he go outside

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,210
he'd run around he play getting all

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,400
kinds of trouble all day when he got

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,770
home at night his lungs literally burned

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,760
like physically burned from all the

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,350
pollution that he breathed then

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,080
throughout the day so it was a pretty

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,750
serious problem the good news is that we

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,370
finally got smart and about 30 or 40

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,460
years ago we started rolling out these

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,590
green energy sources so we have solar

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,630
panels being installed all over the

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,340
place we've got a boatload of wind

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,800
turbines that are out there generating

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,270
electricity for us and we've got a lot

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,060
of hydroelectric dams that are out there

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,220
and if they survive this torrential

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,050
downpour we've been experiencing without

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,450
washing away we'll keep getting juice

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,000
from them so today we're pushing about

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,010
20% of our daily energy requirement

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,580
coming from green energy sources so it's

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,750
a it's a pretty great thing the downside

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,900
though is that it's fairly new

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,580
technology so there's a few hurdles that

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,410
we haven't quite figured out how to how

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,670
to get over just yet one is that they're

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,290
based on natural sources right so if the

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,090
winds not blowing our turbines aren't

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,360
spinning if the sun's not out our panels

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,680
aren't generating electricity so you

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,540
know they're not always there when we

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,340
need them the other problem is that

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,830
we've rolled out this infrastructure

00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,720
particularly the solar panels so quickly

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,070
that there are times during the day when

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,960
we actually generate more electricity

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,280
than we need and that can be a problem

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,190
for the grid and we'll get into that in

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,690
a minute but the crux of it is that the

00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,850
grid was designed for power transmission

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,310
not for power storage it's basically one

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,010
big circuit right so our grid is

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,110
actually a pretty fragile system we

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,570
can't store that excess electricity so

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,340
what we do is we try to generate just

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,350
the right amount of electricity to meet

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,000
demand at any given point in time

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,860
because if we said too much electricity

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,390
of the grid you know it's just like your

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,580
your raspberry pie some too much voltage

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,560
to it you melt stuff and blow stuff up

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,960
but this is how much grand

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,060
scale so we're blowing up big pieces of

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,540
industrial equipment very expensive

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,150
stuff

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,010
now the flipside is when we don't have

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,320
enough electricity we don't have enough

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,090
electrical generation assets spun up and

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,680
running to meet demand that's when we

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,930
run into blackouts and brownouts which

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,700
is a bad thing too right when I was a

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,320
kid I thought it was the best thing ever

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,089
lots of fun get out the candles and get

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,620
to play with the matches but if you

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,940
think about hospitals and our

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,620
infrastructure that runs off of

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,680
electricity we need that set to be

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,089
reliable and running all the time

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,430
now the crux of the problem in

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,740
California particularly but it's a cross

00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,600
you know the entire country the entire

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,060
world is that our demand for electricity

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,410
fluctuates up and down all day and the

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,900
morning we're all asleep it's pretty

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,790
flat it's pretty easy for us to keep

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,440
production where it needs to be to meet

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,940
demand but then we go to work and it

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
drops we got to figure out how to keep

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,839
the grid and balance at that point but

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,790
then a really terrifying thing happens

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,680
in the evening right about the time

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,930
we're all excited and heading home after

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,360
a long day of work we go home we flip on

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,700
our big-screen televisions we crank up

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,500
that air conditioning no matter how much

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,950
our wives tell us we're freezing they're

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,020
freezing but basically in the short span

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,210
of two to three hours demand on the grid

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,070
skyrockets very very quickly and the

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,230
energy producer struggled to figure out

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,790
how to dump just right amount of

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,310
electricity on the grid to keep it in

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,190
balance at any given point in time now

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,020
in California we have a cute name for

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,060
this problem we call it California's

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,070
duct curve problem because if you look

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,540
at the slope of the supply and demand

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,880
curve there it kind of looks like the

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,490
back of a very cute little duct but it

00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,839
is not a cute little problem so what do

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,370
we do when we don't have enough

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,930
electricity on the grid well basically

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,370
our utilities get on the phone to the

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,900
energy producers and they say hey we

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,170
need more juice crank up that power

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,970
plant or you know flip the the wind

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,470
turbines back on and start sending more

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,839
juice to the grid because remember we're

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,900
trying to keep it in balance what about

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,640
when we have too much electricity though

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,980
and this is where the sad part of the

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,020
story comes into play so if you think

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,029
about our existing power generation

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,150
infrastructure nuclear power plants

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:31,670
hydroelectric dams you know natural gas

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,470
power plants these are massive install

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,380
bases of lots of industrial equipment

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,510
it's not designed to be

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,610
turned on and off with the flip of a

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,650
switch so it literally takes like an

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,210
entire day about 24 hours to get one of

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,400
these resources spun up to actually

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,930
start generating electricity or to wind

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,630
them down so that they're not sending

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,370
electricity now the sad part is that our

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,260
green energy sources like our solar

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,150
panels it's real easy to flip a switch

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,220
and disconnect those things so when we

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,560
need to throttle back production its our

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,690
green energy sources that are usually

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,160
the first ones to get disconnected which

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,840
sucks because then we're not getting to

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,360
use those green energy sources we're

00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,180
polluting the environment more it's kind

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,860
of a problem so it's a really difficult

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,480
problem to figure out and there's a lot

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,980
of really smart people trying to handle

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,570
it in California it's the California

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,070
Independent Systems operator they're

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,470
basically the utility for the state

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,780
these folks have an incredibly difficult

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,310
job because literally what they're

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,230
trying to do is predict the future

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,750
they're trying to look at all different

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,210
kinds of data sources how much power was

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,560
needed last year how many resources do I

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,110
have spun up generating electricity

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,730
right now where are my green energy

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,410
sources at what's the weather gonna be

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,330
like tomorrow can I count on my green

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,820
energy sources so they've got all these

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,500
different feeds of data and they're

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,420
mashing them up using these massive

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,400
supercomputer systems to try to figure

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,170
out what do I need to spin up or spin

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,160
down to keep that grid in balance so

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,720
it's a it's a pretty serious problem

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,190
remember though it's all about that

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,440
circuit we're trying to keep supply and

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,200
demand in equilibrium at in any given

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,660
time so one of the tools that Cal ISO

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,010
has available to them is something

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,100
called the spot price of electricity

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,339
which is just a clever term for a market

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,770
price so it's the amount of money per

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,530
kilowatt hour they pay to our energy

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:21,100
producers actually making and distribute

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,310
energy for us know it's a market price

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,020
so it fluctuates based on demand and

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,570
supply just like any other price so

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,370
literally this price will range like in

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,810
this case study this particular customer

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,240
he was telling me that it would range

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,860
anywhere from like $200 per kilowatt

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,290
hour right when we really need

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,420
electrical electrical generation all the

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,070
way down to like negative to 300 400

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,570
dollars per hour when we're real

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,310
concerned about sending too much juice

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,920
to the grid and blowing stuff up so

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,190
that's effectively a way that the Cal

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,200
ISO can

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,700
our green energy producers for sending

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,669
too much juice to the grid at any given

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,220
point in time now these folks in

00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:00,950
particular had several turbines they've

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,720
got a big wind farm lots of them out

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,400
there they were designed and shipped

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,070
I think they'd been out there for like

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,150
20 or 30 years this person got into the

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,350
market because they thought you know

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,450
what I can make a living off of

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,250
producing green energy it's absolutely

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,450
fantastic so we rolled them out there

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,179
they've been out there they've been

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,450
running operating these are our legacy

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,679
devices that we talked about but when

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,299
they rolled out this spot price of

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,830
electricity these folks started getting

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,539
hit with like a ten twelve thousand

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,740
dollar fine every single day they

00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,809
couldn't get to their turbine sometime

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,419
to turn them off so literally what they

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,650
were doing is they jump in a truck you

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,330
know they'd radio a technician

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,650
technician would jump in a truck and

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,570
that person would drive around from

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,490
turbine the turbine to physically switch

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,690
the turbines off and if they didn't get

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,350
there fast enough then they'd get hit

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,909
with these massive fines so imagine this

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,950
you're this person that got into this

00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,360
green energy space you're hoping to make

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,320
a living and maybe benefit the

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,760
environment also yesterday you didn't

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,860
get to your turbines fast enough and you

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,630
get slammed with like I don't know nine

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,820
ten twelve thousand dollars in

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,559
curtailment fees and so you're starting

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,360
to rethink you know maybe I don't want

00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,860
to be in this green energy space anymore

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,190
maybe it's not something that I can make

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,720
a living at that's kind of a downer and

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,640
remember these things are ruled out what

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,690
I call back in the Dark Ages before the

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,669
internet because as long as I can

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,429
remember the internet existed in some

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,960
way shape or form these are not smart

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,270
turbines remember there are legacy

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,620
devices not a lot of brains built into

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,030
them and they're designed to be

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,860
controlled literally from the physical

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,140
world so you physically have to go up to

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,260
them flip a switch to turn them on flip

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,880
a switch to turn them off so what's our

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,640
green energy producer supposed to do

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,950
here let's think about that Internet of

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,110
Things device definition again it senses

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,370
it communicates and it controls so we're

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,049
sensing the world around us we're

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,850
communicating up with the cloud and

00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,830
we're doing some type of control just

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,289
like that Arduino board can do right

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,520
just like a little maker board can do

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,890
what if we took that type of technology

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,360
those ideas those concepts and we

00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,880
applied them to our wind turbine because

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,650
it's got some of that stuff already it's

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,690
got some sensors built into it so it

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,540
knows you know how fast the

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:08,180
what direction the wind's coming from it

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,730
can change its blade pitch and move its

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,950
head into the wind to generate the most

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,370
electricity possible so it's got a

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,200
control system and it's got that sensing

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,240
capability built into it but it's

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,490
missing that communications piece which

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,140
is critical for us to actually start

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,670
building this Internet of Things that

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,130
everyone keeps talking about it needs

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,980
communication so what would happen to

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,810
that legacy asset that turbine if we

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,460
actually added some type of IOT

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,040
technology to it what would happen if

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,290
these things actually started talking to

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,120
various cloud applications they could

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,710
bridge the physical world that they live

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,360
in right now in the digital world and

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,480
that's exactly what these folks did and

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,490
this case study they dropped a new

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,530
control system into it that had Internet

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,030
connectivity and communication

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,500
capabilities built into it and now these

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,050
turbines are literally smart enough to

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,970
peer into a cloud computing system the

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,740
digital world and figure out what they

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,420
should do in the physical world should I

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,340
turn on should I turn off

00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,600
what's the spot price of electricity on

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,700
the website that I need to check to

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,230
figure out if I should do that and these

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,250
things jumped in value literally

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,720
overnight when they rolled out this

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:17,150
control system so that's one cool thing

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,050
that they did we've got them smart you

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,790
know that are figuring out what they

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,140
need to do automatically the poor person

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,000
doesn't have to run around from turbine

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,560
determind to turn these things off but

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,300
these folks took it a step further and

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,840
this is where the real value I think

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,280
comes in these IOT applications so they

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,480
took all the data that these things are

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,760
generating from all the sensors that

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,410
they have on them and they're recording

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,730
all of that and putting it into

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,950
something that they call a turbine

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,630
profitability report so they've got all

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,670
different kinds of turbines distributed

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,650
throughout this wind farm and they can

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,600
figure out exactly which turbines are

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,430
the most profitable to be running based

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,070
on historical maintenance costs current

00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,750
conditions the model of the turbine so

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,490
they're literally maximizing profit

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,710
based on the big data that these systems

00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,330
generate so they've got all kinds of

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,940
reports they're doing predictive

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,710
maintenance predictive analytics they're

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,880
trying to replace parts based on things

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,470
like bearing temperature before

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,060
something actually goes out and they've

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,980
even got these things set up to do like

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,930
alert notifications for service calls

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,520
when something gets out of whack it

00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,750
shouldn't be you know like for example

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,570
if a bearing temperature gets much

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,970
higher than it should

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,670
a single send them alert out and get an

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,070
operator out there to fix it so that's

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,860
the real Internet of Things smart

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,440
connected skills are great being able to

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,600
look at your fruits and vegetables from

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,010
your app on your phone is awesome but I

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,870
think this is the real Internet of

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,270
Things we all want to get to is actually

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,920
getting data how do these legacy systems

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,810
that are out there they're figuring out

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,030
how can we match that data up with other

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,950
data sources to maybe predict a problem

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,380
before it happens to actually get more

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,760
value out of those legacy assets get

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,120
these things connected to the cloud and

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,690
talking so that was one application that

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,070
I was particularly asked about so the

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,540
maker community the engineering

00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,710
community the software development

00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,910
community what are some other

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,090
opportunities where they might be able

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:05,850
to engage in these types of applications

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:09,780
so back in 2010 does anybody remember

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:12,210
the Gulf oil spill we dumped about 3.2

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,430
million barrels of oil into the ocean

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,590
totally screwed up the environment a

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,480
whole bunch of people died the rig

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,020
caught on fire sank to the bottom of the

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,140
ocean

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,090
now as somewhat of a technology dork I

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,130
look at this kind of stuff and I wonder

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,860
if there was some cloudy analytics

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,680
package looking at that rig could it

00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,890
have figured out that you know all those

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,360
previous evacuation evacuations that had

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,190
to happen all the safety issues that

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,950
were going on if we could have collected

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,260
that data and then in the cloud through

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,520
some analytics package compared it to

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,680
other rigs that were out there that

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,780
maybe had you know a lower number of

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,400
safety incidents could we have

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,840
identified a pattern where we might need

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,850
to change something on that oil rig

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,920
before something very bad happened all

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,380
through the data that it generates all

00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,580
through cloud analytics that's the kind

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,260
of stuff that I think we have to started

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,880
thinking about as the developer

00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,550
community and the industrial space all

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,670
of us so that's another application how

00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:11,010
about city infrastructure this is this

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,500
one was such a no-brainer to me Flint

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,660
Michigan right we dumped a boatload of

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,520
lead into the city's water system a

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,610
whole bunch of kids got sick what if

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,710
there was a sensor in the water that was

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,090
reporting data up to the cloud and that

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,550
cloud system was comparing it to other

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,780
city infrastructures what if it could

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,490
have could have identified you know what

00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,350
the lead level in that

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,730
is way way higher than it's supposed to

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,800
be right now compared to all the other

00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,720
data sources and I'm gathering how many

00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,400
kids wouldn't have gotten sick if we

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,420
could have prevented that that's the

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,030
kind of stuff that I'm thinking about

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,980
that I'm talking about what about

00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,260
manufacturing applications I got into

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,080
the tech industry just as we started

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,580
offshoring a ton of manufacturing it was

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,100
all going offshore because cost of labor

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,900
is cheap or whatever what if in the US

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,190
we could cut costs in manufacturing what

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,780
if we could identify ways to decrease

00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,120
waste by applying this type of

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,790
technology what if we could make

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,500
manufacturing here more competitive

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:07,440
maybe we could create more jobs more

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,480
jobs is always a good thing right so

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,830
those are some of the applications but

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,270
the big opportunity that we're talking

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,860
about here at least from a technology

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,600
perspective is we want to bridge the

00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,670
physical world literally the world where

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,500
our legacy devices live like our wind

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,710
turbine we want to bridge that world to

00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,750
the digital world of cloud computing you

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,640
know software as a service application

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,410
platforms as a service because we have

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,880
almost infinite computing resources up

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,860
there we just need to get our systems

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,510
that are already out there all the

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,580
legacy equipment that sensors

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,559
transmitters closed-loop control systems

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,900
if we can get that stuff cloud enabled

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,590
and actually communicating I think

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,260
there's a lot of value to be had in that

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,370
so it was super easy we were to figure

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,570
out how to do this already and we'd

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,610
already be doing it I wouldn't be up

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,290
here so there's a significant challenge

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,740
in front of us actually getting this

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:58,380
done now the biggest challenge that I've

00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,429
seen is that it's really kind of a

00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,770
two-fold problem

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:04,740
there's a massive technology gap between

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,929
the industrial world and the world of

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,809
the maker community now on the

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:12,300
industrial world this is literally where

00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:14,400
physical value creation takes place this

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,530
is where we wire up electrical loads and

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,840
actually do something in the real world

00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,880
we switch electrical loads to make

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,970
Hardware the builds other hardware we

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,320
produce electricity these are you know

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,960
applications that have been in place for

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,880
a long time a lot of the technology that

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,679
was installed for these applications was

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,290
designed for that specific application

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,750
which means oftentimes its proprietary

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,059
which means it's very difficult to

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,470
interface those types of systems with

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,430
other systems for example our

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,780
cloud-based analytics packages

00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:47,060
but this is where our sensors our motors

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,460
our pumps all of our legacy devices

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,500
actually live now if we contrast that

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,330
with the maker community these folks

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,210
live like in the software development

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:59,060
information technology space so they're

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,740
constantly thinking about how can I get

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,930
systems to inter communicate better

00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,270
faster it's all about data how do I get

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,060
access to more data how do I move the

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,190
data faster now because of that a lot of

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,350
the technology here it's open technology

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,490
a lot of times so we have like tcp/ip so

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,130
that we all know how to talk to each

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:18,380
other right we have HTTP so that we all

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,120
browse the web the same way lots of

00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,010
technology that's all designed to talk

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,550
to each other based on this all open

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,560
standards philosophy but remember what

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,790
we're trying to do here is get all the

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,800
big data when we talk about Big Data

00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,720
we're talking about big data from our

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,000
legacy devices we want to get access to

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,800
that information push it up into our

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,590
cloud analytics packages or whatever it

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,300
is whatever IT system try to figure out

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,580
how we can improve the world

00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,500
by pushing changes down into our legacy

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,090
devices just like we did with those wind

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,690
turbines right we started getting access

00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,700
to their data

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,010
we're started figuring out how can we

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,510
improve how they're functioning based

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,730
off of that big data and we made a

00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,940
change to improve how they were

00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,870
operating that's our objective here the

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,510
other problem is that there's a huge

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,060
cultural gap here as well in the

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,950
industrial world hardware gets installed

00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,140
and then it doesn't get touched for like

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,420
10 20 30 years right

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,200
it's that adage if it isn't broken don't

00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,300
fix it

00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,090
so a lot of times firmware never changes

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,710
software never changes that's why in the

00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,870
industrial space we have incredibly long

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,820
product life cycles that have to last a

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,590
long time grossly different than the

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,450
maker community right we've had how many

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,280
revisions of the Raspberry Pi in the

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,290
past like three or four years I think

00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,570
we're on version three or something like

00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,190
that so so things don't change over

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,910
there very often but they change all the

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,260
time on the maker side so some of you

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,510
out there might be thinking at least I

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,760
hope you're thinking at this point why

00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,330
not use a Raspberry Pi and that's a

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,770
great idea

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,020
because you know what raspberry PI's are

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,940
freaking awesome little pieces of

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,190
Technology you can prototype with them

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,270
incredibly quickly

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,710
they're really easy to learn remember

00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,090
they were designed for education they're

00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,429
super cheap I can't believe

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,409
much computing power you get for $35

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,820
these days it's incredible they're

00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,990
readily available I can have one here

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,980
probably by the end of the day if I

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,590
absolutely had to

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,150
they've even got some GPIO built into

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,770
them so you've got a few pins on there

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,480
where you can actually pull sensor data

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,279
in figure out what you want to do with

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,190
it maybe even turn something off of the

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,200
GPIO pin and they've even got an SD card

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,270
for storage so whatever software tools

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,130
you like or whatever Linux distribution

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,230
you like port it over to that SD card

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,559
and get your eyes where you pie up and

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,970
running

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,179
with the tools that you're used to and

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:31,220
you like how about some reasons why we

00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:32,929
might not want to use a Raspberry Pi and

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,850
if you haven't noticed the flamethrower

00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,320
kind of mean off the rig there that's

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,570
exactly where we're going to install

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,610
your Raspberry Pi

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,770
now the industrial world is a vicious

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:45,049
and frightening place there are all

00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,669
kinds of interesting characters that get

00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,770
pissed off when technology doesn't work

00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:50,720
and throw it underneath their tire and

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,549
run it over so the systems that get

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,230
installed in these applications they're

00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,640
incredibly rugged they're incredibly

00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,070
tough because these are mission-critical

00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,500
applications and remember we're using

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,510
high voltage in these applications stuff

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,059
that if you walk up to it and touch it

00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:07,700
it'll kill you it's not like 3.3 volt

00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:10,880
you know digital i/o here this is life

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,020
or death mission-critical stuff so to

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,700
combat those mission-critical

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,590
applications there's a whole bunch of

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,840
stuff that gets installed or developed

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,850
into industrial systems like IO channel

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,710
isolation which is where if a piece of

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,960
the control system blows up it won't

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,340
take down the entire rig we've eat my

00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,220
resistance because we're squishing

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,559
really high loads of electricity

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,750
we've got filesystem recovery so let's

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,850
say your Raspberry Pi for whatever

00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,100
reason loses power are you a hundred and

00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,100
ten percent sure that it's going to boot

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,350
up without some file recovery issue

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,570
every single time so my point here is

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,610
that right debris pies are super cool

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,200
they're great for software education

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,380
they're fantastic for prototyping

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,100
they're not necessarily designed to make

00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,480
sure the oil rig doesn't burn down

00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,640
because what's the real cost right

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,559
what's the Delta between the $35 pie and

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,240
then oil rig if we catch the little rig

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,950
on fire something they might die at a

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,380
minimum we're gonna lose really

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,840
expensive equipment that you know would

00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,840
be a bad day for anyone that's

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,150
real cost so what is the solution then

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,059
because going back to the opportunity

00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,500
size it is massive remember how long

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,529
have we been shipping electrical devices

00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,690
there is so much stuff out there waiting

00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,190
to be tapped into right if you if you

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,730
look at my company we've been around for

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,480
I think it's like 42 years now 43 or

00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,130
something like that

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,799
and we've been shipping these little IO

00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,090
modules that basically do this you know

00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,010
physical world the digital world

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,500
conversion what you do is you wire up

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,390
something like a motor or a pump to one

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,340
of these cards now the cards aren't a

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,779
one-to-one ratio which means we have

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,880
some cards that will do all the way up

00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:49,100
to 32 devices or 32 pumps motors

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,409
whatever it is you want to talk to now

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,600
if you multiply whatever number you want

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,700
to pick one to 32 by the number of

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,409
modules we've shipped in that time which

00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,539
is roughly over a hundred million

00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:00,950
modules that starts to give you some

00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:02,600
idea of the number of devices that are

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,360
out there that are waiting to be tapped

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,440
into but if you take a much bigger

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,779
approach much broader approach opto 22

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,149
were a fairly small company in that

00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:16,610
industry we compete with massive

00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:19,070
juggernauts like Rockwell Automation and

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:21,610
General Electric Schneider Siemens you

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,840
know multi-billion dollar international

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,029
conglomerates think how many devices

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,529
they've shipped but let's think about

00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,240
the bigger opportunity for a minute go

00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,460
back to Flint Michigan and the oil rig

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,539
those applications those opportunities

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,640
we could literally start applying

00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:38,029
technology that could make the world a

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,620
better place so that's kind of what

00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:41,690
we're looking at here billions of

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,799
millions of dollars billions dot devices

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,240
that we could actually get out there tap

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,419
into and start doing some cool stuff

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,070
with so how do we do it how do we bridge

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:51,169
that gap because like I said there's

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,539
that technology and that cultural gap

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:56,600
that we've got to get over eventually

00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:59,299
hopefully the maker community will start

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,010
migrating into the industrial space and

00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,630
we'll start seeing more open standards

00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,149
and programming languages built into

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,770
that kind of hardware we've got to make

00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,210
the voltages and the currents of the

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,279
real world what those pumps motor

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,480
sensors realize what those things speak

00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,490
we've got to make that available to

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,289
these cloud applications which means we

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:19,610
basically need to digitize it into

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:21,500
things like REST API HTTP protocols and

00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,660
languages that the internet understands

00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,610
hopefully industrial equipment will be

00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,200
designed from the get-go and shipped

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,450
with that kind of stuff built into it

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,310
but it's going to take a long time it's

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,470
going to be a while

00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:36,110
so we in the meantime what you need is

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:39,620
some type of industrial Internet of

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:41,390
Things platform you need like a

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,620
development platform that'll bridge the

00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,570
gap between the physical world in the

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,980
digital world now remember it's got to

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,870
be able to translate what the pumps

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,120
motor sensors what those things

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,380
communicate in to the digital world and

00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,420
it's gonna have to be super tough

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,520
remember when the operator runs it over

00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,350
with the truck we don't necessarily want

00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,690
it to bring down the oil rig or whatever

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,100
bad thing might happen so it's gonna

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,560
have to be able to survive incredibly

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,090
harsh environments going back to the

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,010
billions of devices that are already out

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,750
there we're gonna need a boatload of i/o

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,240
built into this thing and we're not

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,520
talking like 3.3 volt i/o we're talking

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,770
about i/o that can switch huge loads of

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,139
electricity which is what goes on in the

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,270
actual real world and remember we want

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,190
ot communications and programming

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,200
capabilities because there's this huge

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,540
pool of engineering talent out there

00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,740
messing around maker boards if we let

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,750
them get access to this type of

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,850
industrial equipment what could they do

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,560
with it so we need to have a hardware

00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,450
platform that communicates and

00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,940
understands the language is that those

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,490
folks are familiar with things like

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,710
nodejs JavaScript I've been at the booth

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,179
all day and as soon as I tell people

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,830
that they can control a wind turbine

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,629
with some JavaScript code their eyes

00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,360
light up it is the coolest thing I've

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:51,560
seen in my entire career the ideas that

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,919
are flowing from people it's just

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,400
amazing so let's say you're a die-hard

00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:59,690
Raspberry Pi person right you absolutely

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,070
can't get away from your Raspberry Pi or

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,510
maybe you want to quickly prototype

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,630
something with our eyes berry pie and

00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:07,400
yes this is my shameless product plug

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,230
for the presentation I'll just get her

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,330
out of the way this is a Raspberry Pi

00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,340
daughter card so basically you take the

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,110
Raspberry Pi you drop it onto the

00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,830
daughter board and then through the GPIO

00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,570
pins on the Raspberry Pi you can control

00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,820
industrial-grade IO modules and switch

00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,340
those high voltages high currents all

00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,140
from your Raspberry Pi so kind of cool

00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,710
something that's out there we're testing

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,630
it but sort of recap if anybody wanted

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,460
the slides for the presentation they're

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,260
available at that URL up there feel free

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,450
to download them

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,560
the market opportunity here is massive

00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,940
the tools are out there right now

00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,440
remember in the nest thermostat is

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,910
shipping today this stuff we can do it

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,950
right now we just got to get two very

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,300
different groups working together and I

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,220
think it's gonna be up to the developer

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,760
community to actually start making this

00:35:49,220 --> 00:36:01,000
stuff happen so thanks it's all I have

00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:03,710
for everybody any questions questions

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,970
anybody I know somebody's got one it

00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:33,580
always takes one person to get the

00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:33,580
dialogue going that's right that's right

00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,410
well that's where industrial specs come

00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,730
into play you know that's why industrial

00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,589
equipment costs a lot more than a

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,940
Raspberry Pi as they go through all this

00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:03,440
testing specification stuff but without

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,369
doing too much of a shameless plug I can

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,839
tell you there's already vendors out

00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:07,970
there in the market that are taking

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,920
things like Linux and open standards and

00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,869
they're applying them to industrial

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,859
grade equipment so that stuff is out

00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,839
there and available in the market today

00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:16,270
and for not as much money as you might

00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,730
think

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,730
other questions anybody

00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:39,230
hmm it's it's the same kind of thing

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,270
though so on the on the consumer side

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,710
maybe like this building right the level

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,510
of sensor that you buy to track

00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,100
temperature inside the building isn't

00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,470
going to be the level of sensor that you

00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,360
buy for making sure the oil rig doesn't

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,770
catch on fire it's the same kind of

00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,050
thing it's all about risk right it's

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,990
what's the Associated risk if there's a

00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,640
failure and it's you know much larger an

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,840
industrial scale so you're gonna pay for

00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,370
that and I there are a lot of different

00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:08,250
you know sensor companies out there in

00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,290
the industrial space but again you know

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,400
you're paying like way more for that

00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,850
kind of stuff than you are for a

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,130
consumer grade sensor so hopefully at

00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,750
some point in time we'll see the prices

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,040
come down on the industrial stuff and

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:26,220
you know sensors will start getting

00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:27,510
rolled out all over the place yeah

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,220
absolutely you might have to choose

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,420
whatever sincere you need for your

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,130
specific application of it's an

00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:45,140
industrial or consumer commercial or

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:45,140
whatever it is that's very true

00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,610
sure

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:11,480
you do you do I I don't I don't know

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,039
that it's so much an option anymore and

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,720
it will be for a certain amount of time

00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,049
but a quick show of hands in here who

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,380
knows what latter logic is so we've got

00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:24,259
a few who knows what JavaScript is there

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:26,150
we go so the developer community that

00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:28,009
the software engineering community

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,599
there's a shift going on it's happening

00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:32,269
at an educational level like I talked to

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,430
one guy today he was a mechanical

00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:36,880
engineering he said he had one class all

00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:40,130
through college where they taught him

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,779
any kind of like IEC languages

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,130
whatsoever for the industrial community

00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,039
like ladder logic or something like that

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,829
there's just a shift going on right now

00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:50,329
in fact if you go to like like I was at

00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,910
an industrial automation conference back

00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:56,029
in 2015 and they brought a education

00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:59,059
specialist and to talk about how we've

00:39:56,029 --> 00:40:01,160
basically like lost that group of people

00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:04,190
we don't have people that are you know

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,470
highly paid HVAC engineers or industrial

00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:09,170
engineers anymore those type of schools

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:12,920
are kind of going away somewhat in favor

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:15,019
of you know higher-level almost like

00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,239
Theory level learning so it's less about

00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:19,670
actually doing something and more I

00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,890
guess about like you know talking about

00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:25,210
how it might be done so I didn't know I

00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,210
think there's a shift happening though

00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:44,569
part of the problem that we're having at

00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,369
least from my perspective right now and

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:48,470
this whole IOT thing and industrial

00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:50,450
Internet of Things is a lot of people

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,880
are struggling to figure out how to do a

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,440
return on investment study on this stuff

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,930
because you're applying totally new

00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,390
technology to a problem that has been

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,890
alive and we just accept it for a long

00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,660
time so one of the things that people

00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,130
struggle with is if I make the

00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,869
investment into some type of new

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,549
technology how long is it going to take

00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:10,220
for me to actually recruit my investment

00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:12,079
now I'm not necessarily saying that

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,339
maker board stuff

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,959
should be deployed in mission-critical

00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:17,329
life-and-death applications but you know

00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:20,329
what a maker board is awesome for this

00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:21,799
prototyping an idea really quickly right

00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:23,509
like that's what these hackathons are

00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,769
all about we get a bunch of software

00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:26,029
engineers together we throw them some

00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,920
boards they hack together some stuff

00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:29,239
when we figure out what technologies do

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,420
we need to marry together actually solve

00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,160
the problem now if we did have Linux

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,829
based industrial controllers which

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,539
hint-hint we do and then if we had a

00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,219
bunch of Raspberry Pi makers in a room

00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,319
you know trying to code up some

00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:45,019
application and we could easily port it

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,729
over to an industrial-grade system does

00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:50,380
that kind of answer your question they

00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:50,380
totally missed the mark there all right

00:41:52,779 --> 00:42:13,039
what is that uh yeah so it's it is

00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:15,559
you're a hundred percent correct SD

00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,449
cards are awesome these days but would

00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:26,029
you want to drop that $5.00 board on

00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:27,920
that oil rig sure I mean you get around

00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:29,900
it it's just how comfortable are you

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,180
with the risk associated to it that's

00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,180
what it comes down to yeah

00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:16,540
yeah 100% correct you're absolutely

00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,000
right absolutely right so what if I had

00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,730
an API directly to the industrial i/o

00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,400
what if I could program in C or whatever

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:50,490
language you want and I can talk to

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:54,910
real-world electrical levels it's good

00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:58,060
fairly good but the idea the whole idea

00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:00,250
here that I'm trying to convey is let's

00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,050
give the developer community access to

00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,340
the stuff using the tools that yeah

00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,420
that's what I want to get to so I think

00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:09,930
there's a bunch of cool stuff out there

00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,930
you're absolutely right

00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,020
yeah well that's what he was saying

00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,580
that's what you saying about the $5

00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,900
board it's just it's your level of

00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:36,440
acceptance of risk yeah I mean everybody

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,440
wants margin

00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:40,290
that's a great question I don't know if

00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:42,030
this is the theater for them sure so

00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,400
there's there's two things there there's

00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,660
this concept of edge computing or people

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,610
talk about like the Cisco talks about

00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,960
fog computing basically what we do is we

00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,370
take some intelligence and we push it

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,350
down to where something is actually

00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,360
happening and that's where the control

00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,220
system was because it has to live there

00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,020
because of the clouds down and the oil

00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,670
rig catches on fire we can't interrogate

00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,830
the cloud and see if we should you know

00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,110
perform the control to turn on the the

00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,420
fire system so you got to have some

00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,190
control and smarts down there at the

00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,190
edge level but when we're talking about

00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:14,130
getting access to data from billions of

00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:17,130
legacy devices we've got to have the the

00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,840
IOT stuff the the protocols the ability

00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,870
to program it with software developers

00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,670
that has to start transitioning into

00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,910
industrial equipment if we're gonna do

00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:29,970
this so it's not

00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:32,070
we're it's happening right now but for

00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:36,300
to get data from an industrial asset

00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:37,740
into like IBM Watson today I mean it's

00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,000
not a trivial task but there's things

00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,500
like node-red out there where you can

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,940
wire together nodes

00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,859
you know without even having to write a

00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,690
line of code and move data from the real

00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:48,300
world right into a predictive analytic

00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,980
system so it's it's possible today it's

00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,510
just that we're right at that point

00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,609
where we're starting to adopt this kind

00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,609
of stuff and do that kind of stuff

00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:48,690
that's a good question I don't have a

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,790
good answer for you right now but I'm

00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,109
getting the high sign back there so if

00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,950
anybody else has any other questions or

00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:54,900
you want to talk about that further

00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,820
swing by the booth or I'll be here after

00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,860
as well thanks everybody

00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:02,249
appreciate your time

00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,249
