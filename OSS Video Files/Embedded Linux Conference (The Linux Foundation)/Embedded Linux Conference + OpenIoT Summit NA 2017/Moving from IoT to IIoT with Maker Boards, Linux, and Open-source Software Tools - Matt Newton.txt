	Moving from IoT to IIoT with Maker Boards, Linux, and Open-source Software Tools - Matt Newton, Opto 22

In this session, developers will learn how to use the open-source tools, maker boards, and technology they're already familiar with to develop applications that have the potential to deliver a massive positive impact on society. There are billions of devices--sensors, I/O, control systems, motors, pumps, drives--siloed behind proprietary control and information systems, waiting to be tapped into. This workshop is geared towards teaching the developer community how to use the tools theyâ€™re already familiar with to access, monitor, and manage these assets to create a potentially huge positive impact on our way of life.
