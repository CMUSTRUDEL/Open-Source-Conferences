	Linux Cryptographic Acceleration on an i.MX6 - Sean Hudson, Mentor Graphics, Inc

The recent hack of internet connected cameras highlights the need to secure IoT devices. This effort will require robust encryption. Luckily, some SoC devices provide cryptographic accelerators that can help. This talk examines the process of enabling the cryptographic accelerator on the i.MX6, called the CAAM. During the talk, I will discuss ways to connect userspace to the CAAM. Further, I will talk about the relative performance of the different approaches.
