I'd like to go ahead now introduce our

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,269
other keynote speaker for this opening

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:15,179
session and his name is Ahmad Sousou

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,150
he's a vice president in the software

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,250
and services group at Intel and he's

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,340
been the general manager of Intel's

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,449
open-source technology center group ever

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,820
since its inception in 2003 so that's an

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,239
impressive track record the OS TC has

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,040
done a awful lot of good work over the

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,219
years he's going to be talking to us

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,340
about the opportunities and challenges

00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:43,320
in industrial IOT and how secure

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,910
end-to-end solutions will help drive

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,660
that market so please join me in

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:53,980
welcoming in mind

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:59,230
[Applause]

00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:02,350
hey good morning hey welcome to Portland

00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,120
also it's it's actually nice to be to

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,090
actually have to only drive to a

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,560
conference and not and not to fly so if

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,420
you came from California and nothing

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,880
changed its just trainings just as much

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,360
in California as much down there right

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:25,150
here ok so what I want to talk about

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:30,220
today is I want to cover a few open

00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:33,160
source projects that that I think and we

00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,180
at Intel are focusing on that we think

00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,450
are important for for IOT and they're

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,670
important for the success of IOT in

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:46,840
general not this is not just an open

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:52,990
source comment but a comment about the

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:56,050
success of Y of F IOT in general so if

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,470
you think of my short talk as as an ad

00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:02,610
for few open source projects that we

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:09,209
really really care about so so with that

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:13,780
just a bit of background so so we know

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:16,360
and most analysts would agree or there

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,760
is a certain amount of consensus that

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,420
there's going to be some 200 billion

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,900
sensors and fifty billion or so devices

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:30,310
that are connected and and these devices

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:33,940
are going to form quite a bit of new

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,950
usages and these news usages are going

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,190
to create new ways of doing things

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,310
whether it's smart hospitals or

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:47,560
connected factories or or all sort of

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:50,200
new usages that that are going to happen

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,900
because of whether using some of these

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,510
devices and sensors as as a group as

00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,470
individuals and as just connected

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:05,030
connected devices to the

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:09,410
connected to the Internet now now

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:12,830
open-source we think and we believe that

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:16,940
open source is going to play a key role

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:20,090
in in the success of this project and

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:23,450
not only that we feel and we think we

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,960
believe that that that open source is

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,000
going to be a founding founding and not

00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,060
from an operating system perspective

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,310
only but at all layers open source will

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,000
play a foundational role in the success

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,910
of IOT

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,860
I mean already as as you probably all of

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,280
you know there are billions of devices

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,980
that ship today that are that are based

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,110
on open source and and the reason for

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,760
that and the reason that we believe that

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,980
this is something that all of us here in

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,320
this room we probably probably already

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,640
know that it's going to happen but this

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,170
is something that the rest of the world

00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,110
have discovered and the reason for this

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,110
is very simple is that is that generally

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,050
developers and people who who are

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,640
creating these products are finally

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,710
coming to the realization that they

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,160
really don't want to spend all the time

00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:16,850
rewriting another artists or rewrite for

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,890
a sensor or rewriting some functionality

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,830
some system or some infrastructure

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,590
software so it's obviously much cheaper

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,500
to to participate in an open-source

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,600
project and do it correctly and then and

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,810
and use that technology and focus your

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,460
work focus what you want on the actual

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:39,530
on the actual business that you want to

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:43,250
do so so but we see you know for today

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm going to focus my talk on on three

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,940
areas that I think we have challenges

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,930
there are three areas where I think

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,940
there are challenges to to get to that

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,400
vision and and these are areas about

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,460
open source project whether you know a

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,190
project they exist projects that are or

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,200
new projects or things that we need to

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,880
put more effort in you know interconnect

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,540
how devices connect to each other and

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,640
connect to the Internet is

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,040
is one of those areas second one is

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,230
functional safety and I'll talk about

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,560
political safe the Linux a little bit

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,090
and and finally some of the some of the

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,640
changes in infrastructure software

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,860
system and infrastructure software so

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:35,150
let me start with interconnect so so in

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,030
order for all of this entire vision of

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:42,390
of connected connectivity and these

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,570
billions of devices for for this to be

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,400
useful devices and sensors must be able

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,160
to talk to themselves and to talk to the

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,110
cloud they must be able to discover you

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,210
know what's around them what other

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,760
devices are around them what other

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,090
senses that that they are there and how

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:05,310
to communicate with them and and in the

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,380
past in the past there's been the

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,470
problem that we've had up to up to

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,110
probably just few months ago is what I

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,000
would call the extreme fragmentation you

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,930
had Intel and Samsung and Cisco and GE

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,920
on one side and and Qualcomm and and LG

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,110
E and so you had this massive

00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,040
fragmentation where we were headed

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,870
towards what I would call a complete

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,390
interoperability and that would make IOT

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,070
fundamentally broken because if devices

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,500
cannot connect to each other unless they

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,600
are from the same vendors then it is a

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,550
problem and if a device cannot connect

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,890
to a sensor unless it is coming from

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,500
that same vendor that is also a problem

00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,660
so the approach that we have taken and

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,040
thanks to a lot of effort by a lot of

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,100
people including the Linux Foundation

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,170
including folks from the various

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,870
companies involved we've been able to

00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:00,390
bring this together as and I would call

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,580
this a first step so so right now you

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,320
know what what used to be all seen and

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,130
all I see and and all of these

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,780
activities have merged together into

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,400
into one and absorbed you know efforts

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:17,580
like UPnP and so on into one into one

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,860
one effort to to create both a standard

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,770
as well as create an open-source

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,180
implementation that that I really do

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,919
encourage all of you to participate in

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,530
this is the IO tivity project under the

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,979
Linux Foundation that we are that that

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:36,039
all of us have have converged on the

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:39,430
good news is that there are already

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,560
millions of devices that are shipping

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,330
and will be shipping with this

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:49,090
technology so we already there is

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:51,370
already some foundation but we do there

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,650
are also a lot of problems that we

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,800
really need to start working on and

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,229
focus on more that is you know in a lot

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,910
of ways it's better in that these are

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,210
technology problems that we know how to

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,190
solve probably the two big problems that

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:11,220
come to mind are security and

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:14,710
interoperability interoperability is is

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,750
as much as we have done in terms of

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,300
bringing all of these standards together

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,720
there are still quite a bit outside of

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,570
that that it is not and there should

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,880
never be an expectation that all of

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,470
these devices will just connect to will

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,140
just connect to each other without some

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,000
extra work across you know the vendors

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,979
that are outside of these standards and

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,380
so on so this will take a lot of work

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,479
and obviously security and I'm not going

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,520
to go into the security aspect here as

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,920
you're talking about you know all of

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,450
these devices connecting to each other

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,120
and connecting to the cloud you can

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,839
imagine the amount of security security

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,450
vulnerabilities that will be created

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,930
that will need to be you know well well

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,240
thought through and and resolved and

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,089
remedied it in in some foreigner or

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:10,260
another the the second topic I want to

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:13,630
talk about is is functional safety so

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,250
when we talk about autonomous machines

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,240
and by the way this is not just about

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:22,360
autonomous cars this is about autonomous

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,730
factories autonomous robots autonomous

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,850
drones all of these will need to have

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:32,320
certain amount and adhere to what is

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,470
what is recognized

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,120
as the functional safety standards and

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:42,440
the bar and functional safety

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,200
is really really high and and and in the

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,480
past and the world really changed here

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,400
because in the past it used to be you

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:54,680
string along you know 100

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,990
microcontrollers and you have these like

00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,890
microcontroller operating systems and

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,920
and this is how things worked well right

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:07,670
now what is really happening is that

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,970
with in order to support autonomous in

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,370
fully like completely autonomous you

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:17,120
know a drone or a completely autonomous

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,790
car it's gonna take a completely

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,460
functional system functionally safe

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,800
system that comply to the functional

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,420
safety standards and the bar if you're

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,210
familiar with this and I do encourage

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,610
all of you to familiarize with with some

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,410
of these some of these standards it's

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,400
the bar is going to be really really

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:40,279
high and and meeting meeting that

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,890
functional safety is going to take a lot

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:48,290
of effort and a lot of work from from

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:52,610
from all of us here and this is when we

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,500
talk about functional safety it is not

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:59,839
I'm talking specifically about

00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:02,029
functional safety in a full in a full

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,730
industrial strength or whatever word you

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:07,670
want to call it Linux basically when you

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,850
want to take a look at how you create a

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:14,630
functional safe Linux it's a much bigger

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,500
problem than all of these small artisans

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,930
that that that are today considered

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,290
functionally safe and and safe to use in

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,110
this environment so again it's a lot of

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,350
work it's not only code it includes a

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,980
lot of definition a lot of documentation

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,010
a lot of visual inspection and what you

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,600
can imagine in a functionally safe

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,640
environment so I do encourage all of you

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,400
to learn about this topic and I know

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,810
there's a bunch of Intel people here

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,910
that that are familiar in this area so

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,150
last area I want to talk about is I want

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,050
to touch on on few projects that

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:59,430
of them you're probably familiar with

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:02,890
the first one is Zephyr so Zephyr is a

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:07,750
microcontroller operating system Zephyr

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:10,930
can run is in as little as eight to ten

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:15,280
kilobytes and it is meant for sensors it

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:18,790
is meant to do you know for for really

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,790
small endpoints and and what is

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,770
different about Zephyr is is that the

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,180
way we structured Zafar and the way

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,780
we're looking at the fair is that we

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,310
want that to be as broad as possible

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,600
supporting all the different hardware's

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:37,420
with with with very very strongly rooted

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,610
and open source with on the technical

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:45,700
side having the way we're building it is

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:49,150
I would say almost in a linux like

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:51,550
fashion where we are looking up front at

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,890
how it is going to scale and how you

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,320
know how much you can build on it so so

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,570
Zephyr does support and you're able to

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,020
add functionality including networking

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,870
including including some file systems to

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,630
it and so on that that it will enable it

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,150
to grow a little bit bigger but at the

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,850
same time you know the target we want to

00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:16,050
keep that the target in in the Mac and

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:19,110
this microcontroller operating system as

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,910
really it is really for for sensors

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:25,720
Yocto you everybody is familiar with the

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,910
octo the the big difference that we are

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,900
beginning to do in the Aqua is to create

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,700
the specific usages so we've always had

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,470
this problem with the octo where it's a

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,300
great framework it allows you to create

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,210
the embedded Linux that you want and so

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,770
on but it had the shortcoming of it

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,560
takes too much work and it takes a lot

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,690
of expertise so we we started what is

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,240
called the IOT reference gates that are

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:54,760
in the opto which really creates almost

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:58,410
a sample of you know a sample of like a

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:02,140
smart home stack and and some of these

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,240
vertical usages and robotics is is

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,130
another usage that that we are creating

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,850
some of the

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,310
some of that work in Yocto so again it's

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,980
really important to to grow your octo

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,490
beyond the framework and to start giving

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,980
people a more starting point and work on

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,610
a bigger starting points for for actual

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:28,010
usages and and last but not least as a

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:30,540
drone code so the drone code and and

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,200
project that are associated with drone

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,580
code are really important things like

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,010
robotics or s and and many other

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,010
projects like this are really important

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,070
to mature to the to the level that Linux

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,680
is where it is where somebody can take

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,830
these projects and use them in products

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,070
so you will find in all of these

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,920
projects you will find you know there is

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,350
the octopus apps upstairs in the Intel

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,280
there is a zephyr booth also for the

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:04,920
microcontroller OS but also you know I

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:08,280
really encourage you to visit the CDs in

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,750
the Intel booth there will be there is a

00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,460
drone area including the the Intel drone

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,990
board that I really encourage you to

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,270
visit the Intel booth and take a look at

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,890
these again hey thank you very much and

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,130
thanks for coming to Portland and thanks

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:27,120
for your good listening

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:27,120
[Applause]

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,100
Thank You Ahmad and now we're going to

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:35,360
take a short coffee break just before we

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100
head out I just want to leave you with

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,560
one last thought as we start the

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,569
conference I heard something

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,360
just this last week which I thought was

00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:46,759
a really good idea I've been going to

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,699
learners conferences for a really long

00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,699
time and I remember the first couple

00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,829
years that I went to OLS if you're new

00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:57,709
to the experience you probably don't

00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:00,949
know a lot of people we started ELC as a

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,300
little boutique event that you 150

00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:03,980
people and it stayed that way for many

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,829
years and we kind of got to know each

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,540
other so some of us will we come here

00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:10,040
it's like kind of we're coming home

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,040
where we're meeting people that we see

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,690
very often if you're new I would

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,290
encourage you to make connections this

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,910
is a rare opportunity in your career to

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,920
hook up with people who are doing the

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,290
same thing not exactly the same thing

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,769
and that's the beauty of open source you

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,779
can have those hallway conversations

00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:32,000
that will you know give you new insights

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,459
into how other people are attacking

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,470
problems and so I really encourage you

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:39,230
to kind of step out of your comfort zone

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,389
the saying I heard was there is no

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,279
growth in a comfort zone and there's

00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:46,040
very little comfort in a growth stone so

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,389
with that I encourage you to take full

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,949
advantage of the sessions we've got

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,339
prepared but also make sure that you

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:54,649
meet new people and and get to know each

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,480
other and I hope that we have a good

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,880
week so the sessions will start at 10:30

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,360
and we look forward to seeing you up

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,230
there

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,589
[Applause]
