I was looking over the session list last

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,250
night we've got a lot of really great

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,580
sessions I think we cover a lot of

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,130
different areas and hopefully you'll be

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,840
able to get something out of this

00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:16,350
conference this week that will help you

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,750
in your job and and so I want to welcome

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
you I need to do a couple of little

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,539
housekeeping chores before we get to our

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,810
first speakers I want to say a big thank

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,660
you to our sponsors in particular I want

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,700
to thank Intel as our diamond sponsor

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:39,120
and Qualcomm as a platinum sponsor and

00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,730
then we have several gold sponsors the

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,610
civil infrastructure platform just a new

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,500
project by the Linux Foundation and

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,950
there's talks about that this week

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,610
Lennar o Microsoft and sousei and so I'd

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,620
really like to show appreciation for

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,199
these without these sponsors we wouldn't

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,620
be able to have this event and

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,320
appreciate their support

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,390
one last housekeeping thing which is if

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,260
you have any time during the week if you

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,540
have any kind of issue questions need

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,909
any kind of assistance please feel free

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,250
to contact the event staff there'll be

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,680
someone up at the registration booth I

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,090
think during the whole week so they can

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,590
help you with any kind of miscellaneous

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,650
thing that the but crops up now let's go

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,970
ahead and get started our first two

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,369
guests are Lina's Torvalds who probably

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:41,570
needs no introduction but he's like you

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:44,520
know the creator of Linux and and and

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,509
Dirk hundl I tried to say that a little

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,680
bit dramatically who is the chief

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,200
open-source officer at VMware and I've

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,960
actually known both of these guys for

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,790
many years I remember the I remember

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,750
very distinctly the first conversation I

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,020
had with Dirk it was probably at least

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,280
least eight or nine years ago and longer

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,679
than that no because it was before

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,200
anyway but

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,969
I won't date myself but we had a

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,209
conversation at some event in Chicago

00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:20,700
and and he gave me some advice that was

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,680
really useful and I just thought that's

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,519
so typical of open source that people

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,889
are so free and generous with their

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,560
assistance it's not just at the coding

00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,019
level but this had to do with you know

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,200
the early in the days of the C Linux

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,489
forum we were doing a spec which was

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,489
kind of dumb and we needed to switch

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,829
over to just code contributions but I

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,720
just remember that how helpful Dirk was

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,930
and and then I want to share one little

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,859
personal anecdote about interacting with

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,450
leanness this was also many years ago I

00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:59,010
happened to be having lunch with Lina's

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,200
and I brought up an issue that I was

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,209
having with work you know IT departments

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,150
they kind of don't understand open

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,859
source and and you need to get through

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,299
the proxies and the firewalls to get to

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,849
the git repositories and all that stuff

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,729
and I was kind of grousing about some

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,979
policy that Sony had at the time and and

00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:20,190
what I had done to kind of get around it

00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,169
and and and Lina's bless his heart said

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,930
something is like oh that seems kind of

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:29,159
petty and and and I thought you know

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,099
it's like kind of hurt my feelings a

00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,010
little bit but D'Arnot he was right and

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,560
that is the thing about leanest Torvalds

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,199
I've kind of watched Lina's for many

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:46,040
many years I've been doing Linux for 25

00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:49,169
years he's been doing it longer but

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,180
lunes is not right about everything

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,159
we don't want let you know to let that

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,209
go to his head or anything but he's he's

00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,650
right more often than not and and I've

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,199
often found myself when I'm in

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,769
disagreement I have to go back and check

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:08,790
my assumptions and so it's really great

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:12,030
to hear from people of this caliber and

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,319
so I'd like to go ahead and welcome Lena

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,870
cinder to the stage

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,449
he's right here

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,449
