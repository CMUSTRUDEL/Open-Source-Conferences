	From Zero to First Test in Your Own LAVA Laboratory in less than 45 minutes) - Paweł Wieczorek, Samsung R&D Institute Poland

Linaro Automated Validation Architecture (LAVA) is without a doubt one of the best currently available tools for managing board farms. It is proven to be quite a handy tool for both developers and tests automation engineers. Although it is provided together with extensive documentation, creating first own laboratory might be a challenging task. Does it have to be for every newcomer? During this talk Paweł will guide through the process of setting up own LAVA instance. Starting from LAVA installation, through common post-install tasks, up to running first tests on a brand new board farm. He will also present how to manage its configuration and how to easily make deployments automated and reproducible.
