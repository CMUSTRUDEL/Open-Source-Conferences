	The Aftermath of a Fuzz Run: What to do about those Crashes? - David Moore, Fuzz Stati0n

Fuzzing is a highly effective means of finding security vulnerabilities - new, easy to use and highly effective Linux based fuzzers such as American Fuzzy Lop and libFuzzer have driven its increased popularity. Once a fuzz run has found cases that crash the target application, each must be reduced, triaged and the root cause found to enable a fix. In this presentation, David Moore will describe tools, tactics and techniques for performing post fuzz run analysis on the resulting crashes with the goal of fixing the vulnerabilities.
