Description: 
	First Experiences with the Embedded Debian Build System Isar - Jan Kiszka, Siemens AG

In some of our embedded projects, we are using Debian as the basis. In others, Yocto with its Poky distribution is the basis. Isar promises to combined the best of both: the layered, extensible, reusable set of image generation rules (bitbake) with the a mature, long-term maintained, pre-built, feature-rich distribution (Debian).

In this talk, we will present our first experiences with isar while creating a bootable image for a target device. We will look into standard tasks like defining the package set or defining partitions and file systems. We will also present how we integrated a custom boot loader and performed various customizations. This will provide a first impressions about possible workflows with isar, its strengths but also its to-dos.
