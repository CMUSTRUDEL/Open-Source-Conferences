	NimBLE - A High-Performance and Highly Configurable Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 Stack - Will San Filippo & Sterling Hughes, Runtime

Apache Mynewt's NimBLE is the worldâ€™s first fully open source Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 stack for both host and controller subsystems for MCU environments. It offers highly granular configuration options such as number of slots per connection, max number of concurrent connections, multiple advertising instances, and more. The configurability enables a wide variety of use cases previously difficult to address with closed or licensed-binary stacks: such as 32 or more concurrent connections using the Nordic nRF52 chip as either Central or Peripheral, large data bursts when connected to a large number of peripherals, ability for a peripheral to connect to multiple centrals, etc. The flexibility of design and configuration also allows developers to reduce stack size in resource-limited environments.
