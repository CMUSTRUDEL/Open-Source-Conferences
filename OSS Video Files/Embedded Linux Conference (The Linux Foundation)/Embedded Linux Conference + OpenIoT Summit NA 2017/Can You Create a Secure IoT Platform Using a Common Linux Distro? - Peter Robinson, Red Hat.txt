	Can You Create a Secure IoT Platform Using a Common Linux Distro? - Peter Robinson, Red Hat

Can you take a common Linux distro like Fedora and enhance it to be a secure, stable base for IoT? What is secure in IoT? How do you secure a device, or in the case of a gateway, the entire network today and into the future? In this session I'll outline my vision and direction for a secure, modular Linux IoT platform based on Open Source tech, what we're doing right now in conjuction with the Linaro LITE initiative as well as the roadmap vision towards tomorrow's IoT world using multiple platforms/architectures with technogolies such as OSTree and Atomic to ensure to ensure smooth upgrades/rollbacks, security technologies such as toolchain enhancements, KSPP, seccomp and selinux to try to ensure secure robust platforms, device and policy management across thousands of devices as well as a modular container platform to enable a stable edge to data centre or the cloud end to end solutions.
