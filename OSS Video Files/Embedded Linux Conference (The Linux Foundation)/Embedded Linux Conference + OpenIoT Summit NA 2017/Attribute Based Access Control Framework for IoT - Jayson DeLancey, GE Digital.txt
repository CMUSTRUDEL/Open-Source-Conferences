	Attribute Based Access Control Framework for IoT - Jayson DeLancey, GE Digital

The Access Control Service (ACS) is an open-source authorization framework that provides app-specific policies built using attributes that can be assigned to users, groups, roles as well as other resources, relationships, and things within a system. 

ACS was built as part of the Predix Platform to overcome some of the limitations of XACML and OAuth when dealing with problems such as device provisioning in IoT where roles can be dynamic and location specific.
