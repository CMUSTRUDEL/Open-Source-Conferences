Description: 
	Forward Porting Google Nexus 5X / 6P - Lessons from the Trenches and What's Next - Jeremy McNicoll, Red Hat

An overview will be provided on the mainlining effort for Nexus 5X (msm8992) and Nexus 6P (msm8994), how we got here and where are we going. As well we plan on discussing what was learned from this experience and offer some tips for those brave (stubborn) enough to try something like this for themselves. This talk will provide a lighthearted overview on how (and why) we managed to get basic board support(1 CPU , serial, INITRD) mainlined to help kick off community participation. 

Originally this effort was planning on curing world hunger, but reality set in very quickly after an initial assessment of the MSM kernel tree vs. mainline and what it would take to move everything forward. Those interested in helping out may receive some parting gifts.
