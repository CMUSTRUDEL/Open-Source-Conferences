Description: 
	Making Tweet Monkey - Jeremy Foster, Microsoft

Tweet Monkey is a hilariously simple maker project that anyone and their mother can make. Tweet Monkey responds to tweets. Send a tweet using #tweetmonkey and he dances! Usually, creating an IoT projects means dusting off your college reference book on the C language and trying to wrangle a low-level language to do modern, high-level tasks. In this course, however, we're going to talk about the hardware devices available that enable writing JavaScript with Node.js to control motors, sensors, and switches while simultaneously using easy and modern node modules. We'll walk all the way through the creation of Tweet Monkey including modifying the monkey, setting up a Raspberry Pi 2, wiring a circuit, and writing the code to access Twitter's streaming API using Node.js. Absolute beginners, students, and kids are completely welcome.

About Jeremy Foster
I studied Computer Engineering and Math, and have thoroughly enjoyed my career course ever since - primarily teaching and software development and primarily on the web stack. I gained experience in education, aerospace manufacturing, and insurance, and eventually joined Microsoft with the goal of informing and inspiring software developers. I try hard to keep up with audiences via my blog at codefoster.com and my Twitter feed @codefoster.
