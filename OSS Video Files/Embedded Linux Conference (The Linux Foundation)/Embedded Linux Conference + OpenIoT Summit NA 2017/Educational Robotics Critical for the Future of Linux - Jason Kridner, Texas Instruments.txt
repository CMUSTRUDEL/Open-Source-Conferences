	Educational Robotics Critical for the Future of Linux - Jason Kridner, Texas Instruments

Jobs are being automated. Students aren't getting sufficient STEM literacy. Many lack the problem solving skills to be effective at driving that automation, rather than being a victim. Educational robotics is a compelling and effective way to reverse that trend. Lower-cost, easier-to-use and inherently collaborative platforms can help ensure these programs expose all participants to programming and electronics.

Computing is inextricably a human endeavor to get machines to serve our will. Linux provides opportunities to teach critical concepts including how to collaborate, aide understanding with instrumentation, simplify various tasks with existing solutions and expose students to the possibilities of their endeavors. Not only do these students need Linux, but Linux needs them and the solutions to the challenges they'll tackle for the next generation.
