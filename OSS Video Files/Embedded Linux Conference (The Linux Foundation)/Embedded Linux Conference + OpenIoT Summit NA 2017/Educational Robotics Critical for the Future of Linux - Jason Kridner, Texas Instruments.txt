	Educational Robotics Critical for the Future of Linux - Jason Kridner, Texas Instruments

Jobs are being automated. Students aren't getting sufficient STEM literacy. Many lack the problem solving skills to be effective at driving that automation, rather than being a victim. Educational robotics is a compelling and effective way to reverse that trend. Lower-cost, easier-to-use and inherently collaborative platforms can help ensure these programs expose all participants to programming and electronics.

Computing is inextricably a human endeavor to get machines to serve our will. Linux provides opportunities to teach critical concepts including how to collaborate, aide understanding with instrumentation, simplify various tasks with existing solutions and expose students to the possibilities of their endeavors. Not only do these students need Linux, but Linux needs them and the solutions to the challenges they'll tackle for the next generation.

all right thank you very much for

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,940
joining me sorry I'm late

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,440
took a second to find the place I was

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,900
right next to it and didn't realize it

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,849
so here I am so I'm Jason Craig nur

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,720
employee of Texas Instruments and I'm a

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,910
co-founder of BeagleBoard org and a

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,900
board member at the BeagleBoard org

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,230
Foundation which is a non-profit and I

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,990
want to talk to you today about

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:34,320
educational robotics and why that's

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,969
critical for all of us here even if what

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,840
we do has nothing to do with robotics

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:42,840
and and really important for the future

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,450
of Linux please feel free to interrupt

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,000
me and ask questions I'll either repeat

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,620
the questions or give you the microphone

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,820
but I do I would love for this to be an

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,000
interactive session we're actually

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,500
talked about you know some of your

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,020
experiences and why you feel this is

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,420
important as well or maybe you don't

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,070
think and a lot of this I've tried to

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,159
write term perspective of those who

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,409
might be a little bit skeptical and hope

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,850
to address some of the skeptics in the

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:15,780
audience and you know who you are please

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:19,350
don't forget fraid to be a target so

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,080
jobs are being automated the the the

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,150
education really isn't there that's the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:32,900
real problem set up and really computing

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:35,759
is very much a human endeavor it's a

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,740
it's yes we were we were controlling the

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,180
machines and we'd like to keep it that

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,560
way

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,150
that we're controlling machines and up

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,670
the machines controlling us they're

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,799
raising future generations of people

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,159
they need to understand how these

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,869
machines work and they need to

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
understand how the people that create

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,189
those machines work and that's what I

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,979
think of the things is a really amazing

00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,899
about Linux itself right because it is

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,930
the most collaborative software project

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,099
ever on the face of the earth and that's

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,800
that's why it's so important the crus

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,240
that's why it's so important for

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:18,750
robotics to be part of Linux

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,100
and for Linux be part of robotics so you

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,510
know one of the one of those questions

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:28,590
is like why do i why do i care about you

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:33,600
know getting jobs for the youth why is

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:37,140
that a problem for me personally if they

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,590
want to be ignorant and maybe a strong

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,570
term i hope but if they if they don't

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,290
want to do too better let them flip

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:52,410
burgers right that turns out to be a

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:55,380
really bad answer because because

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,270
ultimately if if they're not able to do

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,000
something productive feel valuable in

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,980
society and contribute more they're

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,140
ultimately going to be mooching off of

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,240
us right they're going to hurt our

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,360
standard of living they're going to hurt

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,790
our happiness and they're going to be a

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,820
problem for each and every one of us so

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:19,050
it's not okay to just say that you know

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,300
it's if if they can go flip burgers and

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,610
you know pay the basic bills that

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,950
everything is going to be be happy

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,080
because they're not it's ultimately

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,400
going to come back and drain on you and

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,670
guess what that job of flipping burgers

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,180
it's going away too that's not going to

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,310
be there the robots have already taken

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,570
over the manufacturing sector there's a

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,010
lot going on in the political

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,660
environment today where people are

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,180
talking about how we're going to get

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,150
those jobs back because they went

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,500
overseas I think most of you are

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,310
probably where they did not that many

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,840
really went overseas some did but a

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,930
whole lot more of them went into robots

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,690
and when you know they're just trying to

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,130
do a lot more in higher income places

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,110
doing a lot more manufacturing higher

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,610
income places looks like what that's

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,160
going to mean is the economics the

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,840
economics are going to make even more of

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,560
those jobs be take being taken over by

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,910
robots because you know you don't have

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,910
to take lunch breaks or smoke breaks

00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,720
it's already going on in manufacturing

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,870
it's dominated the java sector of

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,700
manufacturing and now it's going on to

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:36,570
service sector jobs and and so those

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,750
jobs are going to be going away to to

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,820
robots so sorry you're not going to be

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,580
able to flip burgers because I've

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,290
already got a robot to do that and

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,680
that's that's our that's our imminent

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,300
future that's something that's actively

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,700
happening this is an example of a

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,700
start-up in San Francisco called

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,620
momentum machines so a couple of images

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,120
here of the burgers that they created I

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,250
say I find this really interesting

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,140
because they're they're grinding up

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,520
different meats so that you can have you

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,280
can actually choose the amount of a

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,380
bison versus hamburger that you wanted a

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,270
meat and it grinds it it slices the

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:19,620
tomatoes it cuts up the pickles it

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:20,880
shreds the lettuce and I thought that

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,620
was like that's the grease that's the

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:30,210
flavors good part so he said it's this

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:32,670
yeah you know I somebody's going to get

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,840
this right right if they don't someone

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,940
else will right that's not that's

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,920
something that we've all learned and in

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,770
our open source software world and

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,360
explorations and technology if you don't

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,190
go and solve this problem somebody else

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,310
will so guess what somebody is the

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,710
there's the economic shift for this and

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,040
we already have you know those wages for

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,350
these service jobs going up they get

00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:02,220
high enough it's going to be replaced by

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:04,560
machines and it's happening so where are

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,620
they going to do right if they're not if

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,040
they're not going to flip burgers what

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,280
are they going to do and there's there's

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,150
not a lot of sectors so this is this is

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,600
all this is us u.s. job data on the

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,610
right and population growth on the left

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,060
so the world's currently growing at

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,920
about 30 percent and there's not that

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,960
many jobs that are actually growing

00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,470
faster than 30 percent right this is a

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,440
list of

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:37,560
the United States if you're supporting

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,840
wind turbine that's number one growth

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,880
job in the United States and spurs

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,300
percentage it's not a huge number of

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,560
jobs today but it's growing really fast

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,600
guess what that's pretty technical all

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,880
right you're going to need some system

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,480
education to go and do that for one it's

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,260
a robot by the way it's you know very

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,880
much in that thing but a lot of this

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,760
you'll see a lot of service sector jobs

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,550
around medicine supporting the

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,730
population that's growing keeping it

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,340
healthy and growing but there's you know

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:15,510
not a tremendous amount of these these

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:19,440
jobs home health so the most of these

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,150
are health-related with just a handful

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,330
of exceptions with financial advisers

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,760
and operations research analysts and of

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,750
course some technical jobs but if you

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,200
look at in terms of total numbers this

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,850
is the top US job growth in technical

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,450
numbers may be hard to see some of these

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,120
numbers there's only two of them over

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:47,070
$70,000 and there's only three of them I

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,979
think over 32 over 3 or 3 of them over

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:53,750
folks are four of them over $32,000 a

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:59,280
year most of these are low with low wage

00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:03,750
job growth so there's at around 60 plus

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,100
there's nurses and accountants that's

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,160
the only that's the only that's the

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:12,780
first two to go past 60 and then the

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,280
last two are general and operations

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,660
managers so you have to you have

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,130
probably have to have some sort of

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,510
experience go into management you

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,870
probably have to have some sort of

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:24,690
Illustrated skills and down here the

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,410
highest paid this list is software

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,210
development right so the skills that we

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,089
have if if you actually want to get paid

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,180
halfway decently the market the jobs are

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:39,030
going to come from from software there's

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,760
a nice article and wired recently about

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,110
how software essentially the next blue

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,660
collar jobs

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,209
right I mean this is if you want to get

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,829
a decent living wage moving forward

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:58,079
you're going to you're going to have to

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:59,850
have programming skills and it's a lot

00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,820
of the importance for us like okay we

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,680
that's what they need to do that's great

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,209
but again why does this affect me why do

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,470
I care

00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,769
yeah I don't want them to be a burden

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,230
but they can go into nursing and in

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,459
other types of health field now they

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,760
don't necessarily have to go into stem

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:20,269
you know I think that but it's about our

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,160
job all right it's about what we do

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,649
because you know just you know we're

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,390
scarce today right and that's why we

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,570
feel the you know like we're in high

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,610
demand but the demand for us is not

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,140
necessarily all that high because

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,890
there's there's not necessarily a great

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,600
understanding of of what we create so if

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,269
we're not actually helping to build the

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,029
populations understanding of the

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,220
technology that's underlying their their

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,959
life experiences they simply won't value

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,570
us so we need to make sure that they're

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,949
educated so that they know that they

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,010
should care about things like free and

00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:00,329
open source software all right if they

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,529
don't understand the technology why

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:04,170
would they care that somebody else is

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:07,079
locking in behind a vault they're not

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,260
going to care things like privacy and

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:13,320
security right lots of people building

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,000
insecure applications you know you're

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,820
getting notifications all the time about

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,380
your credit card numbers being

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,529
compromised and turning over all the

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,630
time and that's if there's not an

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,980
appreciation for the technology that's

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,050
underlying to make that happen

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,490
nobody's can support the investments to

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,810
actually fix any of that so is that even

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,519
though we're scarce that doesn't mean

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,339
that the demand is really high and there

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,959
needs to be some demand creation for

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,019
these skills and so they have to

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,490
understand the technology and you know

00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,060
why do they even care about their

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,790
ability to impact technology right they

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,410
see it moving forward all around them

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,839
but unless they understand what their

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,080
real capabilities are for being able to

00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,070
address deck and

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,000
what what what it requires that they're

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,420
simply not going to be able to make

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,540
educated choices about where to spend

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:11,800
their time and your boss simply won't

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,829
understand your value so it matters and

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,490
I kind of summarized a little bit of

00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:22,149
this in my head as a Gandalf effect so

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,279
you know you'll Gandalf knows things he

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,839
knows how to do things that the hobbits

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,220
don't right Lord the reference of all

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,779
the Rings reference rollers you just

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,709
hopefully I didn't lose me back there

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,839
but you know so he knows that nobody

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,540
else does it so it's he can do magic

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,029
right it's amazing things that that the

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Gandalf can do and sometimes we as

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,779
embedded Linux developers and engineers

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,310
we end up looking like Gandalf and the

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,950
hobbits simply done our standard value

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,750
and I think that that's a pretty lonely

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,120
life I don't think that's the future

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,510
that we want to paint for ourselves is

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,430
to just be just to be magician a

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,420
sorcerer you know I think we want people

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:08,020
to actually understand and appreciate

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:12,540
what it is we do and I think for this I

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:15,160
think might touch a little bit of the

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,829
Linux audience in general but maybe not

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,890
so much here at the embedded embedded

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:22,290
Linux conference but a lot of people

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,700
might have this thought you know I have

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,890
plenty of challenging algorithms and

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,810
stuff to do without ever touching

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,100
Hardware why do i why do I need hardware

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,010
right there's plenty of problems to

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,350
solve and the cloud another platform

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,540
like like mobile phones stuff where the

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:41,350
hardware is kind of just a platform and

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,529
I'm just just coating to it so why do I

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,930
so much care about engaging with this

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,579
dirty hardware stuff it's good to back

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,720
there might burn my fingers I might you

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:53,860
know my my so if I don't know it's that

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,920
maybe that's not so much true here

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,829
because you guys are embedded but I want

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,209
you to ask yourself you know what's the

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:08,170
real impact of what I'm creating right

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:10,650
do we need another filesystem do we need

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,030
another data

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:18,840
you know what are the do we need another

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:21,300
our top duck you know the think about

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,010
what the real impact is moving forward

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,000
about the things that you're you're

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:29,910
creating and recognize that today's

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,400
hardware is very much a limitation to

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,850
technology and what we can do right

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,710
we're you know tethered to these these

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,900
devices you know these computers and

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:43,230
these these phones and we're limited by

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,750
I can only interact with one thing at a

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,910
time so I have hundreds of applications

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,710
on here but I can only interact with one

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,990
of them because I have to go through

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,030
this touch screen all right and then I

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,280
have just blowing up at me I don't know

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,260
why this buzzer is going off you know

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,960
90% of the time I have to ignore it

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,580
because every application has like one

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,530
way to notify me and it can't figure out

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,090
what I'm doing all right it doesn't know

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,730
I'm currently giving a presentation

00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:14,250
right now and I'd be kind of bummed out

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,570
if my phone rang I so and the hardware

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,800
is a part of that right it's about if

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,360
you can create the hardware that

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
interacts with you where you want when

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,490
you want

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,140
right when you walk in the room the

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,010
lights turns on that requires a center

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,590
all right you know it's simple thing but

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,670
but but you know it requires hardware

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,740
we're not just going to get it out of

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:36,540
our phones and our computers it's not

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,570
enough and I'll emphasize this I try to

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,290
say this just about every time I talk

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,350
you know it comes to open source and and

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,750
doing things that way atoms are valuable

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,640
people understand when they buy

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,380
something and they hold it in their

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,860
hands is tangible they understand it had

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,310
a cost to manufacture all right that

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,630
somebody actually took some goods

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,100
collected them modified them and put

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,510
them into some condition they don't

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,970
necessarily understand that when they

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,970
have electrons right the freely moving

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,220
that's the expectation now we we care

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,840
deeply and want to put value in those

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,360
electrons because we we understand

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,970
between us the value of something like

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,550
Linux right but we also understand the

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,680
value of keeping it free and keeping

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,250
those electrons moving

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,580
really so you think of well why do I

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,750
want to get my hands dirty and hardware

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,190
just think about that a little bit right

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,350
so when you want to try to produce value

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:42,800
for people they understand the value of

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:45,279
atom and then why you know what the this

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,190
is this is a perspective I have and I

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,920
I'm constantly trying to figure out what

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,930
it is that kids think today so for me

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,140
this was very this statement was very

00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:00,830
much true a DAT any prominent speaker

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:03,020
we're in the list gobs of excitement and

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,990
entertainment and everything I needed to

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,839
get excited about programming right I

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,899
mean you can you can build synthesizers

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,180
and voice just look like the first time

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,860
I got some code that I cut and pasted

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,649
and made some voice come out of that

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,649
speaker oh my god it was the best thing

00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:24,890
ever and that's all I needed to be

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,570
excited but what kids are growing up you

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,830
know when I serve with computers you

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,529
know I got the ready prompt and I

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,000
started typing in you know stuff at the

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,470
command and I wanted to play a game I

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,060
had to type it in and understand it

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,940
right it's just kids are just

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,110
experiencing a technology and a totally

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,740
different way especially when it comes

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,320
to computers so their idea of hello

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,180
world you know is halo right and that's

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,339
probably 10 years old or I I don't know

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,860
I mean I know we've seen some minecraft

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:54,680
stuff gets done but that's not the same

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,080
like like the games and things the

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,080
experience on computer just so amazing

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,240
and be so hard for them to try to

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,730
reproduce or in to really improve upon

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,679
right there so intimidating the wall

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,199
just looks so high to climb over right

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,360
when I used to subscribe to Radio

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,040
electronics get those circuits out of

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,829
there and you can put those together and

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,339
you know you know in a week or two like

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:21,439
you know it was you just felt like so

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,510
empowered right and you feel like you

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,000
could take over the world the computers

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,829
are not don't look like that to kids

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,500
that's something that we have to accept

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,000
and understand now there's some great

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,340
tools out there

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I love Arduino

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,760
I love blinky LED right because it's

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,980
that it can be just a opening when

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,900
somebody says okay I've given it this

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,929
instructions and it does exactly what I

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,970
said it to do right and that's some of

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:51,559
the magic of a microcontroller world

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,690
right because the only code it's running

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,159
is the code that you put on it

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,610
so it's almost back to of the old

00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:02,690
computer days and so blinking LED can be

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,690
very compelling and engaging but is it

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,370
really empowering enough right is you

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,159
know I think that we have to look at

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,980
what the next thing is because blinky

00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:16,990
LED is now very pervasive we've had

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:20,779
Arduino since 2006 it's 11 years later

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,820
you know what's the next big on-ramp and

00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:26,809
how do we how do we make that even even

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,100
bigger we have some great success with

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,679
robots today already

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,950
lots of good proof points with FIRST

00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,500
Robotics and best robotics

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:39,140
but um and and they're kind of proving

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,789
these items out right because robots

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,100
themselves can be different enough from

00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:45,740
their everyday experiences to be

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,230
exciting all right it's not halo right

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,240
it's it's something that I don't see

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,730
these video games every day right robots

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,799
are something new right I maybe see them

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,520
on TV or see them other places but I

00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,559
don't have maybe you have a Roomba but

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,850
you know most for the most part you

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,710
don't have a lot of robots or you don't

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:08,270
recognize the robots in your home like

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,980
your dishwasher they're different enough

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:14,289
to be exciting and they're simple enough

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,289
to be accessible Patrick

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:24,059
oh I just want to echo that I have a

00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,340
video of my 14 year old son two years

00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:31,200
ago doing a FIRST Robotics Competition

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:33,929
or filled in video of him saying the day

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
I saw that arm move up and I knew that I

00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:39,809
made the code do that was the proudest

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,779
day of my life yeah thanks for that

00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:44,309
anecdote that was perfect

00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,690
yeah and it's simple enough that they

00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,599
can actually achieve that I can achieve

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,940
it in you know a couple hours or less

00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,009
right they can they can wire something

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,720
up to a board with a driver and a

00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:57,960
battery and actually write the code to

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,299
make an arm move and so it's simple

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,729
enough to be accessible and it's complex

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,399
enough to invest a lifetime of

00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:09,919
exploration all right they're just the

00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:11,940
problem space in robotics is extreme and

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,349
nobody's been able to solve all the

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,979
things that we already know robots can

00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:20,029
do all right we know they can do them

00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:22,409
but it's a small matter of coding right

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:31,039
you know we're not all we don't all have

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:31,039
our flying selfie cam yet why not little

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:45,310
and um I just wanted to sort of add a

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,920
little bit this because you and I

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:51,040
typically come at this from a software

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,700
perspective and robotics encompasses so

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,490
much more

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,480
my daughter was into robotics and

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:03,580
competed in the International Science

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:08,110
Fair for a number of years but when she

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:11,170
finished and went on to college she

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:14,230
especially said I hate programming she's

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:18,940
now a chemical engineer okay

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:21,190
and when she was a law when she was her

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,780
first job was actually designing the

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,720
robot arm but she was much more

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,290
interested in making the mechanics of it

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,840
work and there's a lot of stuff within

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:35,080
robotics that's not just mechanics not

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,270
just programming so you need to keep

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,810
that in mind it's certainly a broad

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:44,380
field and allows them and I try to start

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,400
this with a pretty broad speaker I try

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,650
to start this is a pretty broad

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,150
perspective right that it's you know we

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,580
want them to know about Linux that we

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,900
want them to know about robotic and and

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,450
that's not just for people that are

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,640
going into engineering that is the

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,010
general population it's like reading

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,330
writing and arithmetic Linux and

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:07,060
robotics and I don't mean that as

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:11,610
hyperbole I think that those are that

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:15,490
sort of basic skills and if you go into

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,460
medical field if you go into financial

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:22,390
field these are still areas that impact

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,070
your life and I think it's just you know

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,050
be us being the kind of the

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,590
knowledgeable ones right the keeper of

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:33,310
the keys that that we need to share that

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:36,430
the rest of society I'm going to being

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,880
too preachy but the the try to get it

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,880
going here

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:47,529
hello okay

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,359
so one of the issues is having a

00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:53,799
convenient place to go and buy these

00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:56,919
drugs like all them drugs and the best

00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:04,090
drug purveyor that I've found is

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:06,539
Adafruit in New York City l'amour freed

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,639
has done a tremendous amount of good

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,979
trying to create a maker community you

00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:15,429
buy things are made of fruit you get

00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:16,809
instructions it's all free I highly

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:20,139
recommend it

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:21,820
even your eight ten and twelve year olds

00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:25,059
can go to Adafruit and figure out what's

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:27,039
going on great Greg blog and I agree

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,859
with that I would throw the some folks

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,739
like Bart Ron and Pololu sort of in that

00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:36,009
mix but I think Lemoore Lee Morris

00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:38,979
tutorials are particularly fantastic and

00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:41,590
we need more more support like that

00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:45,580
that's an excellent example of somebody

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:50,049
helping to solve the problem and anyway

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,729
so too robust you know are we have to

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,090
see that the kids see technology

00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:58,210
differently and that robots are great on

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,099
rested technology right that it allows

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,859
them to have that hook that just sitting

00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,269
in front of the computer alone isn't

00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,379
right and that's that's because there's

00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:08,320
so many different ways we could think

00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:10,989
about it I keep coming back to robots is

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,369
the answer that's the way we get kids

00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:19,450
into programming and and that's so cool

00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:22,179
right but you'll read a Linux conference

00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,720
right are you preaching robot sorry

00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:27,970
preaching Linux and robots and

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,979
confessing I'm preaching right so it's

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,489
Linux and robots it's not ok it's not

00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:36,309
enough just to have a little Arduino

00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:38,499
bots I think that we need to try to get

00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:43,179
Linux into that equation and get it in

00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:45,340
to get in early so here's a great

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:48,989
example one of the easiest on rope ramps

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:51,309
to two robots Lego Mindstorm

00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:53,740
so with their latest version of

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:58,299
evie three so when they introduced the

00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:00,610
ev3 they added Linux why did they add

00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:04,210
Linux because they realized the value of

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:08,470
community and and that's and that's why

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,360
right so they wanted to increase the

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:15,210
collaboration space the ability for

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:20,769
other people to add value into the robot

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:25,600
and to affect the the tooling the the

00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:28,960
security the understanding that comes in

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,990
and using robot so they did it they saw

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,200
something I'm hoping that we can see

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:36,879
some of those same things so giving

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,799
those eyes on our right see why do you

00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:40,480
need collaboration right you know I

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,330
think this shallow bugs and most of us

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,779
subscribe to the to some of the Eric s

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,950
Raymond thoughts and you know the bugs

00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,440
are shallow when you have enough

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,970
eyeballs right and you care deeply about

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,039
bugs when you're talking about security

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,360
these robots are going to you know

00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,350
people are going to be building robots

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,639
in the hundreds and they're not always

00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,529
going to be super skilled at every

00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,669
single level and not that you when you

00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:04,690
want them to write their own networking

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:08,799
stacks you want them to to write their

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,869
own you know management of guilt you

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,450
know it's so many different places

00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:16,360
wherever Linux takes takes care of

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,710
things probably not right we want to get

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,210
eyes on it right we want to give them a

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,659
common code base and we want to try to

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:25,600
help work together to make sure that

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:29,350
that base is has the eyes on it and it's

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,490
a place for people to go from tools like

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,440
Linux a lot of you do things like

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,879
configuration management right so if

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,559
you're going to put hundreds of them out

00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,999
there you know how do you make sure that

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,379
all these little controllers that aren't

00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,269
connected you don't have some secure

00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:41,769
communication mechanism how do you make

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,440
sure that their version control - how do

00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:46,779
you how do you monitor them how do you

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,299
make sure that they're all that they're

00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:53,619
all right so and there's certainly a

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,899
there's there's two balancing forces

00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:58,690
going on here that's written on a

00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:01,539
microcontroller I write it so I

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:04,320
understand it I know that nothing else

00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:07,340
is going to happen inside my system

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,059
all the code that it's running as mine

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,740
ignoring the fact that you're calling

00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,330
library functions ignoring the fact that

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,070
you're calling you're relying on

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,899
compilers to generate the code that's

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,700
going on they're ignoring so many of the

00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:20,700
things that you may or may not have some

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:25,460
good reason to trust but you balance

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:29,580
that against you're running something

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:33,899
like Linux we were able to build off of

00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:36,750
the understanding of others and there is

00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:38,639
a trade-off but you know I would I would

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:42,090
say that this is very much in the

00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:43,950
balance in favor of Linux where you have

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,590
processes and you can watch those

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,049
processes you can look at all the kernel

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,110
calls and you can explore everything

00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:53,539
that's going on in the system you have

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:56,990
debuggers that you can run in the system

00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:00,090
you there's just so many different tools

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,039
for you to build upon and so many

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,259
different somebody opportunities for

00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,590
that that I think it's it really goes

00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:10,200
well beyond the did I make it or did

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,519
somebody else and and so many people are

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,129
building off of Linux I think it gives

00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:20,299
you a very well understood starting

00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:23,789
point so excuse me so the risk of

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:27,240
kicking off a buzzword bingo here isn't

00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:29,879
IOT and smart homes I think of them as

00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,039
robots I mean they're just not the

00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:34,200
conventional robots that you seem to be

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,639
alluding to in this talk here I mean

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,870
we're talking about sensors we're

00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:39,419
talking about collecting all this data

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:44,190
we're talking about security network I

00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:46,170
mean we I think that we walk past the

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,380
speaker

00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:50,850
I do think we're talking about this the

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,100
same thing for the most part but when

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,540
you're talking about from a technology

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,950
building block alright because you're

00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,140
talking about Spencer she talked about

00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,700
network connections right if it's IOT

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,740
your smart home it is all those things

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,110
but where I'm starting this presentation

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,330
is how do you get that hook into the

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:10,110
kids and it's making that object run

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:12,360
around right so they start with making

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,070
the object run around and do physically

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,140
mobile interactions in their life as

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,390
well let me just flip that problem over

00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,090
instead of having the robot move around

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,700
I can turn that into I can build a 3d

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:27,210
printer I can build a laser cutter I can

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:30,410
build the dishwasher I can simply create

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,240
a door lock I can turn the light on off

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:36,630
it's just a I'm saying that Linux

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,130
robotics is the entryway into all those

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:43,760
skill sets and putting robots first

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,760
mobile robots first

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:55,990
so I I'm very happy to have the

00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,420
interaction it's actually great for me

00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:02,290
business this has been one of these

00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:05,640
differences between PCs and cellphones

00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:09,430
and what's happening in arduino z' and

00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,230
raspberry PI's and beagle boards is it

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:15,120
allows computing to go out to the

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:19,300
physical world so physical computing is

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:23,530
the hook that we that is of interest to

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:27,400
kids not sitting there with a gizmo that

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:30,790
can only interact with pixels it's

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:35,050
making something sensing something and

00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:37,450
and actuate inquiry and and now there's

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:41,050
and there is a lot of amazing and

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:43,810
important problems to solve just in the

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,570
theoretical algorithm space

00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:58,480
let's but again we're talking about here

00:30:46,570 --> 00:31:00,100
is easy the on-ramp right so I've been a

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,580
robotics mentor now for about eight

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,060
years

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,760
in the high school robotics programs and

00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,730
when you see these kids actually make

00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,410
something happen in the physical world

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,300
that's the difference I mean the IOT

00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,340
sensors and things of that sort we have

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,500
lots of sensors on the robot but sensors

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,480
are just providing us data it's not

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,910
really something that the kid can look

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,550
at I mean for instance they were really

00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:27,610
excited we had a new sensor that detects

00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:30,460
spinning axles and they were excited

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:33,310
because they I could actually show them

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,890
on the cellphone the infrared light that

00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,080
made it work they couldn't see it until

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,210
I showed it to him on the cell phone and

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,520
then once they understood that there was

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:47,020
a physical thing that was making this

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:48,850
counter go up it clicked

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,580
so hopefully we've set it enough

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,530
different ways now it's we're all

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,420
echoing each other at this point but I

00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,760
mean then Linux is already there I mean

00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:01,630
when we talk about smart homes and IOT

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,610
and Linux is there I mean give Linux it

00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,620
is about the Linux isn't always the

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,660
choice to build robot and it's not

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,400
necessarily the focus right especially

00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,179
around educational robots I think that

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:16,240
Lego is out ahead of the curve on the

00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:19,360
first so the the natural instruments

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,350
with their their Robo Rio is also out

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,170
ahead of the curve

00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,210
and I think you'll that relationship

00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:29,890
between demand Lego is also very

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,570
noticeable in that that realm but if you

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,740
if you look at a lot of the tutorials

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,260
that are out there that a lot of people

00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,550
are getting started to build robots some

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,929
of the similar ones mentioned earlier

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,090
which are fantastic turtles they're very

00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:42,940
much focused on microcontrollers and do

00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:46,390
not include Linux in the equation there

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:52,030
are some out there most of them are very

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:54,580
expensive the idea I think that it's

00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:57,130
it's still not a see the the

00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,770
affordability and accessibility level as

00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,140
microcontroller robotics I think that's

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,059
the reason why you see so much of the

00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,730
microcontrollers there's also that that

00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,620
theoretical concept of well I you know

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,970
it's not I didn't write the code and see

00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,670
it have the making that direct

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,559
connection between I wrote it and it

00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,120
happened it gets a little bit fuzzier

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,350
when you're writing a C program running

00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,660
on an operating system as opposed to a C

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,870
program it's directly banging a a

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,760
register but it's but it's not that much

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,790
different than trusting your your C

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,380
standard library or your compiler tools

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,600
right I think Linux is just one more

00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,240
piece in there that you need to start

00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,830
with some trust but the great thing

00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,270
about it is ultimately you can you could

00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,620
get rid of that trust you can look at

00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,240
the store so you can understand every

00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,650
bit of it

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,809
but I think it's an important

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:50,890
abstraction layer that we should have

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:52,179
early robot Isis using so that they can

00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,860
learn all the restaurantes they learned

00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:55,640
about Linux command lines they learn

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,210
about you know

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,730
the open source processes right not just

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,660
working on code in a bubble right which

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,160
is what you do when you write a

00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,800
microcontroller program that only runs

00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,020
on your robot right there working in

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,210
this bubble I start out saying that

00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,370
computing is very much a human endeavor

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,590
and that's what I want to try to take

00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:18,080
these kids out of the idea that it's

00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,450
just them in the robot and put them in

00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,230
the idea it's them and all the people

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:27,440
whose software has been created you know

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:29,390
and that they're building on top of and

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,020
all that knowledge that they're working

00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:34,820
with and the robot right so it's getting

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,600
that human interaction and understanding

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,640
about git repos and prep and you know

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,200
you know configuration management and

00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,690
all those things that yes they don't

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,850
need that to turn the motor but it's

00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,780
there and the concept is there for them

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,870
to learn when they're ready to move

00:34:47,780 --> 00:35:03,770
forward I if it's super quick because I

00:34:50,870 --> 00:35:05,180
objected yeah there's this because

00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,920
they're using Linux there's so many

00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,270
extra things that they understand that

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,800
they wouldn't understand if they were

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,970
just programming on their own in the

00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,310
microcontroller because they're getting

00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,920
exposed to so much more of the software

00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,600
space and that's the curricula it

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,980
doesn't have to get in their way a lot

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,530
of times it can get in their way and

00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,210
that's what we want to prevent

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:26,360
and that's we'll talk of a little bit

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:30,020
more about that but you know it's so

00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,580
important that it is there when they're

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,740
ready to move forward but they're not

00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,020
developing in the bubble so there's

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,860
there's a number of different of talking

00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,240
into the microphone there's this is a

00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,800
number of different projects out there

00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,450
today whether it's good points of

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,300
collaboration for you folks looking at

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,550
trying to make advances in the state of

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,340
open source software on Linux and

00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:56,630
robotics Ross is one that really stands

00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,990
out I I sometimes struggle to really you

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,460
know fully grasp the importance of Ross

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,680
it's something that I don't necessarily

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:06,740
feel like I need I'm just not doing

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,010
things at the scale that a lot of Ross

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,580
developers

00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:14,490
are the its most fundamental element

00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:18,840
from my observation is its ability to

00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:22,620
pass the message passing and that's not

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,600
neva right it's it's you know it could

00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,830
do message passing between robots and

00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,760
synchronize things between different

00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:31,560
computers and it includes some concepts

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,940
of what it's trying to communicate I

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,230
think that's kind of one of the

00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,400
important parts of the messaging layer

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:41,100
it's in there because it's it's done you

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,630
know what with understanding the data

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,390
types of the information that is trying

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,890
to send right so it understands you know

00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,270
I'm trying to control a motor I'm trying

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,550
to just tell the robot to go to point A

00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,170
to point B so there's some person

00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:56,090
distinguishes just not arbitrary message

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:59,970
passing there's a number of great

00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:01,290
autopilot software's and and and flight

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,350
planners and all the things that go

00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,790
around deploying drone there's even some

00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,740
some higher-level management simulation

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,900
pieces related to some of these projects

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,900
especially like a drone code is Anabelle

00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,540
umbrella project managed by the Linux

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:19,680
Foundation and includes a number of

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,570
projects you know underneath it the date

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,970
and you know among those auto pilots

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:26,730
flight planners but there's there's a

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,860
lot more going on there are G pilot I

00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,900
find particularly interesting it was

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,390
actually kind of led into some of the

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,040
creation of drone code itself but now I

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,210
think they've I think they've I don't

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,410
want to get too political but I think

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,980
they've split up again paparazzi is a

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:46,170
good one

00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:48,750
so both so all of these are accidents Oh

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,690
drone code are G pilot and paparazzi are

00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,600
all done to run on both microcontrollers

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:58,380
and Linux platforms and that's a that's

00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,330
a bit of a mixed bag in my mind but but

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,100
it's definitely good the Chica me so

00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,160
they you have a common API base and the

00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:08,490
transitions across having Linux or not

00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,410
having Linux so I think they're all

00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,790
interesting projects to get involved in

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:17,520
I mentioned Lego Mindstorm

00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:19,590
earlier I think it's nice because you

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,940
for people that don't want to get much

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,400
into the mechanics you

00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,440
can you buy young mechanical pieces and

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,750
just start assembling them fairly

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,030
quickly and the education that you build

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:34,050
there's some good off ramps from moving

00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:38,420
moving forward developer vb3 dev it

00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:40,920
happens to be here that's a project that

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,930
takes some of the base code that this

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,490
was released open-source by the Lego

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,250
Mindstorms and makes it all rebuildable

00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,560
if you can actually create the distros

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,210
for the the the ev3 itself and

00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,640
customized a distro and also target

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:55,920
other platform like a BeagleBone and

00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,790
Raspberry Pi good

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,430
there's also Legos which i think is

00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,980
running Java development too there so if

00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:08,160
you're a Java guy I think that one makes

00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,069
them interesting a row black one of the

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,819
most interesting sensors in the robotics

00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:16,319
world is the camera that's also for a

00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,730
lot of your IOT stuff that's super

00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,980
interesting right bridges so many

00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,569
different categories but the opencv

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,589
project is a really great one to get

00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:28,790
involved in in terms of of robotics and

00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:35,359
advancing robotics I think I've got a

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:39,000
idiot time check seven minutes okay yeah

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,980
the kernel iio

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,170
interface is probably where a lot of the

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,839
different things are going to go there's

00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,339
a lot of room for opportunity in the

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,440
kernel itself and particularly within

00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:54,180
the i/o subsystem to improve the state

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,400
of things for robotics yeah I don't

00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,760
think that there's like a standard motor

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,130
drive or like I think it's I think

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,690
there's a quadrature newly there's some

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,490
sort of encoder I think that we're still

00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,619
we still have some work to put our

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,170
hardware encoder support for the wheel

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,740
feedback and some things like that into

00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,630
the kernel it like the kernel is really

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,319
behind and some of these areas relative

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:24,270
to where people are coding and I'll talk

00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:26,160
more about that and shameless plug

00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,680
you know the BeagleBone blue project in

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,930
particular we've got a C libraries and

00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,460
I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:35,300
about here that's called libera badhak

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:38,119
case that just kind of abstracts the the

00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,780
kernel and the system beneath it

00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:45,050
and there's some pretty glaring problems

00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:47,390
within it that I mean it is great from a

00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,609
usability standpoint but I think from a

00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,380
embedded Linux and what we'd like to be

00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:52,880
putting out there perspective I think

00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,410
there's some some problems that I would

00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,410
like some contributions from folks in

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:04,130
this room to help resolve to really put

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,630
Linux in its proper place here so you

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,109
can get some documentation off of

00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:11,500
strossen design calm that's the guy that

00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:14,359
designed a cape for the BeagleBone

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,250
provide a library he's a graduate

00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,770
student at the University of California

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:22,420
San Diego and he had hundreds of

00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:27,260
students utilized this API for creating

00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:29,720
creating robots so this is pretty

00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,720
recently tested with YUM that's

00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,420
literally hundreds of robots up there of

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,880
many different types of shapes and forms

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,579
and fashions and tracked robots

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,549
balancing robots flying robots

00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:46,520
you know from for from for props to a

00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:48,440
prop anyway lots of different things it

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,390
starts with some simple initialized code

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,880
the thing I'll point out here is that

00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,819
this goes and just when it initializes

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,380
some P threads so it starts some user

00:41:55,819 --> 00:42:01,880
space thread and then it maintains a

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:05,690
file within the file system the process

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:09,049
ID so if I start up another program I do

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,329
I could do kill robot essentially it's

00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:13,010
going to it's going to it's doing in

00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:15,619
user space it's managing who's using

00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,260
this this broad class of peripheral so

00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,910
there's only one application using them

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,319
I'm hoping that symptom alarms that some

00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,270
people write but that's all being that

00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:28,670
hardware management is being measured in

00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:31,609
user space but it is but at least it's

00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:34,069
managed right so you can have one robot

00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:36,260
xscape library user going on a time if

00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:38,390
they're following the right API and

00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,099
calling initializing and calling cleanup

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,660
at the end and then there's some

00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,070
additional state management he defines

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,650
four states

00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:47,090
in there including an exiting state so

00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,370
that other applications can centrally

00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:52,700
notify the thing to clean to cleanly

00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:55,970
shutdown and also to to notify it to

00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:58,360
pause to do you know so if you specially

00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,370
your software kills your pause switch

00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,640
and then this is this is when I kind of

00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:07,870
wanted to highlight he you know he's

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,240
creating these these userspace threads

00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:12,800
and then using them registering see

00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,030
function callbacks in order to get

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,740
notification when the buttons were

00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,050
pressed to make it really great for

00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,640
somebody is designing a robot but is

00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,800
this the you know the right ways that

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,320
you want to do that in the Linux kernel

00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,430
and is it is it events underneath and

00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,290
this is just some things you might want

00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,970
to start kind of thinking about but this

00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:32,150
makes it really easy for the roboticists

00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:34,240
to write a program and see to adjust

00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:38,180
their state based on getting the button

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:42,260
pressed DC motors similarly so instead

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:45,910
of just saying okay call the PWM sis SS

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:49,130
entries you know he's doing that here

00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:51,770
actually he's doing he's using some some

00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:54,290
basic configurations at this F S at the

00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:58,990
memory Maps the peripherals in userspace

00:43:54,290 --> 00:44:02,420
to reduce the latency the update and

00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:06,080
more than that on the the Beagle bone

00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,030
blue for things like the servos and EFV

00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,970
those electronic speed controls for

00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,470
building quadcopters the typical use

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:14,870
three-phase brushless motors and they

00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,820
used some surgery so instead of doing

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,460
that the three-phase control on the

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,110
Beagle bone we usually what most people

00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,370
do building quad copters which is use

00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,760
these electronic speed controllers

00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:27,140
outside and we send pulses to

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,450
essentially say how fast to turn the

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,770
motor but instead of using Hardware

00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,150
these are actually written a microkernel

00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,230
does the implementations are going on

00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,960
microcontroller on the Beagle bone

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,740
there's a couple of hard real-time

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,780
microcontrollers is dedicated the

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,100
function of generating these pulses so

00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,910
he's just using shared memory between

00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:45,350
the two processors to notify the to

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,660
notify the other processor to generate

00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,180
these pulses at this pattern and it

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,000
gives them some flexibility of the

00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,170
different types of pattern to generate

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,420
from depending what you're typing if

00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,680
you're controlling servo motors

00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,210
which you telling a motor like the

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,830
servomotor is one that can go from a

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,560
certain degrees to a certain other

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:05,780
degrees back and forth and you control

00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,370
that with a PWM signal and NESC

00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,100
essentially you're using a PD min to

00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:13,670
control the speed and the motors are

00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:17,680
directly providing Drive output and one

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:20,330
of the nice things about this this

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,890
library implementation and for somebody

00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,330
that's building a robot to their first

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:28,460
time as they're all built into example

00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:32,120
application so if I want to build a

00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:35,180
robot I can simply connect up the motor

00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,820
to the pin and call it the function a

00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,400
not very not call a see function run the

00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,930
application from the command line

00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,340
providing command-line arguments to test

00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,410
motors so I don't even have to create a

00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,350
program in order to test my ability to

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,850
turn an individual motor at an

00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,350
individual strength or individual

00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:54,170
direction right I can just do that from

00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,460
the Linux command line and of course all

00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,720
the different other possible ways that

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,980
you could in order to integrate that

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,540
right same thing for things like the

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,920
quadrature encoder or not Lisa you're

00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,770
able to go and test all the hardware

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,550
just running these these pre kampala G's

00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:12,490
or space applications and that includes

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,350
other things like reading from the

00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:17,840
sensors on the board right for the for

00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:19,250
the IMU for the barometer so those are

00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,560
important sensors for doing things like

00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,870
balancing robot I think this helps

00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,740
provide a framework for building a lot

00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:30,740
of different types of robots fairly

00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:34,100
quickly and easily there's nothing magic

00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:37,210
in here that keeps it tied to a you know

00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,950
a beagle platform or anything like that

00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,390
but it also wasn't obvious that there

00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:46,400
was something else out there that was as

00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:48,770
easy as a C function call for turn-turn

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,660
motor right you know to set DC motor

00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:54,920
step-step motor right you say which

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,180
number motor you say the float I mean

00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,890
there's you know of course there's

00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,450
Arduino libraries and stuff but they're

00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,800
not I don't think that they're as simple

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,720
as that

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,760
and this is just the standard C that you

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:10,080
compile with GCC right no no

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:16,740
no funky rapper and it's not in C++

00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:18,870
I consider that a boner and and this is

00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,780
where I wanted to try to close us some

00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:24,060
action because I think I think the the

00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:29,130
big message I came in with was like you

00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:33,030
we need to have Linux we need to have

00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:35,960
robotic running on Linux and make sure

00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:39,300
that that education is going across the

00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,920
entire world but I don't want to that's

00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,420
boiling the ocean that's you know kind

00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:48,380
of grandiose right so what is something

00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,380
that you can walk away as an action and

00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:55,260
yes so I said these okay get that gut

00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,690
feeling at these microcontroller guys or

00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,340
you're just going to go and screw up the

00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,280
kernel and I mean their memory mapping

00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:04,230
things at user space and doing crazy

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,640
stupid things but you know ultimately

00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,930
they're not going to screw up the kernel

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,670
right there's lieutenants process

00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,710
there's they submit patches that don't

00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,410
work we're going to we're going to clean

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:16,800
that stuff out but ultimately they need

00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:18,480
your help right I don't think it's the

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,820
right way to do these things in user

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,350
space right I think you guys I think you

00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:27,150
might be able to see the value of

00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:29,970
putting the control the common controls

00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,890
for robotics into the kernel all right

00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:33,420
and maintaining that I mentioned all the

00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,700
great things about using Linux right

00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,640
eyeball all right

00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:41,880
security coming from those eyeballs

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:47,220
right additional use cases right there's

00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:50,190
just a whole lot more ability to you

00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:53,510
know to share knowledge when you're

00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:57,300
putting it into that shared code base so

00:48:53,510 --> 00:49:00,360
iio needs more sensors you know we need

00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,430
to address people's perceptions in terms

00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,290
of if they see ok these guys I think

00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,520
they have to write a Linux driver not

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,380
only is it more work because they don't

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,710
understand how to do it which not that

00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,330
hard to compile a Linux kernel module

00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:14,040
but you know you know there's the

00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,410
perception there's no way - okay what's

00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,030
the API what's the build process right

00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,460
not that hard but we need to make sure

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,010
these

00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,650
No and it seems to adding too much

00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:25,660
latency right they're not sure where to

00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:28,180
draw the boundary right so to see you

00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:30,550
you want to have a program that's your

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,650
robot but what's the what's that

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,420
boundary into like do I put the

00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,280
balancing system where I have to have

00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,430
that latency between the sensor and the

00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,300
motor drive into the kernel and

00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,099
ultimately I don't I don't know the

00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,200
answer the smart people in this room do

00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:48,220
at least when we work collaboratively on

00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,359
the problem so you know that's that's

00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,770
something I want to I want to work out

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,990
right so how do we close that loop

00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,670
tightly without having to do transitions

00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:01,060
between kernel space and user space like

00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:03,400
a TED nauseam and you know I think it's

00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,619
a statement of the affair when you just

00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,070
I'm really hoping this is not overly

00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:10,599
political but what even the Linux

00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:14,260
Foundation projects are signing up to do

00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:17,320
things without Linux all right it's just

00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,849
it's just it's it's a it should be a

00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,720
wake-up call for those of us that really

00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:24,820
want to make a Linux pervasive you know

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,960
if it's why is it not a solution for

00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,060
these things and it should be something

00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,920
that's a bit of a gut check for us I'm

00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,150
not questioning their decision you know

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,520
there's nothing to do with that it's

00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:38,320
just you know what do we what do how do

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:40,000
we react to that at the community so

00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,599
that's my conclusion I don't know if I

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,609
saved it I don't think I save any time

00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,660
well we'll have some some demos I'll

00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:50,770
kind of show some different things

00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:54,790
running at the Showcase that's good we

00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:57,430
know in the showcases tonight seven five

00:50:54,790 --> 00:51:01,300
five to seven so yes it's going to come

00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:02,800
find a beagle board at the Showcase and

00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,320
what we'll do some symptom I wasn't kind

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,430
of do some show fun stuff but hopefully

00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,589
this talk was informative and motivating

00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:13,420
I appreciate your time and good

00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:15,480
afternoon

00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,480
