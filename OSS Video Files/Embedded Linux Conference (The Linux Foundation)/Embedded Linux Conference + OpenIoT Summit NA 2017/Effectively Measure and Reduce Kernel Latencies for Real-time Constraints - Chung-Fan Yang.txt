Description: 
	Effectively Measure and Reduce Kernel Latencies for Real-time Constraints - Chung-Fan Yang & Jim Huang, South Star Xelerator (SSX)

The latency means the time after a task is invoked and before it is executed. It depends on Linux scheduler latency, the deferred execution method (workqueue vs. tasklet vs. kthread), and the priorities of competing tasks. In this talk , we show the effective ways to experiment the different methods, in terms of their response latency, and figure out how the system load, and user space task priorities affect them on both Intel and ARM architectures.

We will also analyze and improve the scalability of Linux performance in multi-core environments upon the measurements, used in actual real-time applications.

About Jim Huang
Jim leads the engineering team of South Star Xelerator (SSX), building open source based commercial solutions for information infrastructure and robotics. After involved in Android Open Source Project, Jim specialises in real-time and virtualization to bring Linux based robots to fit for the industrial requirements. He is the co-founder of LXDE project, a lightwight desktop environment widely used in embedded devices such as Raspbery Pi. speaking experience: ELC 203-2015 and OpenIoT 2016.

About Chung-Fan Yang
Chung-Fan Yang is current 4th grade student from National Cheng-Kung University, Taiwan. Majoring is electronic-engineering, he spent most of the time on firmware and embedded system developments, from hardware to system software level. Recently, he focued on the experimenting real-time Linux kernel and exploring different real-time performance optimization techniques for various applications.
