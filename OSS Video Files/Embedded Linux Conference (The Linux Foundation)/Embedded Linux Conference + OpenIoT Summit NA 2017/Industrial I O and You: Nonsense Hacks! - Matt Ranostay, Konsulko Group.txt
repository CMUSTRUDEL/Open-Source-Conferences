	Industrial I/O and You: Nonsense Hacks! - Matt Ranostay, Konsulko Group

Learn about how to develop an Industrial I/O subsystem driver for an entirely new sensor, and how userspace HALs can process data with reduce system I/O than a pure "userspace driver". Some of the things that will be covered is iio channel consumers + definition, SW + HW triggers, and ring buffer interface. There will be some in-depth overview of the development API to implement a new driver, or add functionality to an existing iio driver. Also will demo of several sensors using the various functionality of iio, including but not limited to hrtimer sw triggers, and buffered data to userspace HALs.
