Description: 
	Using Devtool to Streamline Your Yocto Project Workflow - Tim Orling, Intel Open Source Technology Center

Devtool is a set of tools which has simplified the process of creating, maintaining and deploying packages built from source by the OpenEmbedded build system. Operating in either the standard build environment or the Extensible SDK it can either modify an existing package or create a new one based on project source code. Devtool can deploy the resulting package to a target, add the recipe to a bitbake layer and build an image that includes the package. This presentation will summarize how devtool has improved since its initial release in Yocto 1.8 then describe its current capabilities in detail and finish by sharing plans for enhancing existing features and adding new ones.
