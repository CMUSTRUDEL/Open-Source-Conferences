what can I really I don't know what the

00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,950
plan is for the other door just leave it

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,330
open and then we get this done and I

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,760
think it's the last slot of the day

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,730
anyway so I don't want to keep you too

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,639
long so my name is Massimo Altman and I

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,190
will present a little thing to give an

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,070
insight on an education hardware project

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,369
that we have combined with the Zephyr

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,600
open-source artists and what you can do

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,099
with it and give you a couple of hints

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,779
and ideas what you can do with it if you

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,170
want actually do it further stopping

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,090
start going with it as usual a little

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,430
bit of display myself a project trade

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,440
Memorial Foundation Plutus is a travel

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,300
to seek and all other trademarks are

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,440
they're respected on us so just to keep

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,210
that out of the way and don't have too

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,360
many are to brutally murdering my

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,649
presentation I'm repeating this one

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,620
since off because the second talk I'm

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,379
giving today I've been working on

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,390
Bluetooth for pretty much seventeen

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,649
years now so it's really long time and

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,020
the technology's still around and used

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,820
so that's good I maintain the bluesy

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,510
stick which is able to stack for Linux

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,680
since 2004 since it has been for a while

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,570
in the meantime I created a couple of

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,400
open source projects a connection mentor

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,580
for Linux a telephony stack a fluid F

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
nice tactfully notes proxy services and

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,720
also an embedded Linux library and a new

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,159
wireless daemon that talk will come on

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,390
Thursday so if you're interested in that

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,229
one

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,030
I joined Intel in 2007 so that's my ten

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,360
years now this year it has been a while

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,920
as well I sit on the architecture review

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,930
board for the bridges sake where we

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,180
actually got the new specs I'd share the

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,159
internet working group and also driving

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,840
the Buddha smashed innovation which will

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,549
be coming out sometime this year and one

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,740
of the new standards for Bluetooth so

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,220
let's dive into this one

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,399
Zephyr so I took this text from the

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,869
Zephyr website and it's pretty much an

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,430
artist like anybody else you can pick

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,409
what any other artists you want but

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,759
Zephyr is one of the newer ones and from

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,140
an artist point of view the same thing

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,850
but it's not an angel

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,640
architecture only thing it will work on

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,120
multiple architectures like again

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,369
probably

00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,619
in the future so it's pretty much open

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,090
community-driven at this point this is

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,130
nothing really special it's just okay

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,830
someone did another artists what is

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,210
really special about this that it's

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,250
supposed to have a really truly open

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,320
source community but with a background

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,700
that you actually can build products on

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,380
top of this you know the whole linux is

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,300
used in the enterprise world we have

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,130
something where you actually have an

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,360
open-source project but it's used in a

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,860
commercial form and that's really

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,720
intention and the licensing everything's

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,790
of what's this what is more interesting

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,170
what I actually highlighted here that we

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,940
decided to put a con ever to

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,220
connectivity stacks multiple of them

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,110
actually at the heart of the artists so

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,540
with a lot of artists you have oh you

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,280
have maybe one that has a little bit of

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,870
an IP stack it has this feature of that

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,310
feature and you're actually picking your

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,450
artists depending on what connectivity

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,370
feature one or some of the other

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,560
features you're not really picking one

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,210
that has everything and the goal is here

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
pretty much we want to have good

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,090
beauties low-energy support we've been

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,980
having a good Buddhist classic support

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,330
we want to have ipv6 support we wanna

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,370
buy TVs ipv4 support 16.4 threat

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,770
wireless Wi-Fi and so on and so forth so

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,420
connectivity's at the heart of it but

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,610
fundamentally when we go into the sensor

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,510
world or the Year embedded devices world

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,370
for the IOT space

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,700
you can't live without an i/o

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,750
connectivity stagnant you want this

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,360
deeply integrated into the operating

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,860
system so that you actually have the

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,140
smallest footprint possible it don't

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,489
have to piggyback on other stacks or

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,870
just buy this one with that OS

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,250
abstraction by that more than source

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,690
abstraction pick that open source one

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,370
and solid have to do them together

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,470
maintain that so you're getting really

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,250
everything in one thing can focus on

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,800
your application development this is a

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,320
little Builder slide that I grabbed from

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,180
the Zephyr project the difference is the

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,560
microcon at the Nano kernel immersion to

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,140
unified kernel also just ignore that

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,940
piece the interesting part is really on

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,620
the right side where as I just said the

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,110
connectivity is part of it and we want

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,340
to building this all in if you get

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,290
Zephyr you get all

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,870
activity solutions at once and we will

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,590
keep improving them and driving them

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,810
with new standards and extending them

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,340
right now it's Ark x86 and arm supported

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,870
you have the standard stuff and you have

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,430
a really nice set of API is on top of

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,109
this the crypto comes with there that's

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,609
really deeply integrated so when you do

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,079
this from an ecosystem point of view

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,449
this is what I've mentioned earlier is

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
like if I want to build something I

00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,870
gonna pick a piece of hardware and

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,030
hopefully the hardware manufacturer

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,010
gives me a board and then gives me a

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,870
port Support Package for this oneself

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,430
okay this is hole where your pins ours

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,419
is what you'd be also etc you don't have

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,250
to worry about anything else so if

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,540
that's their something that's community

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,710
maintain it so when you actually take

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,150
the Borden's or everything's they are

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,560
you get zeph are you get the

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,520
connectivity tag if you're looking for

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,590
something doing with Bluetooth Low

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,940
Energy that's already there the only

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,380
thing you really have to do is the

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,520
vendor differentiation so you want to

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,590
write an application that does something

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,180
special you focus on that one not on the

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,340
rest of integrating everything else at

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,020
picking oh I need holo I have the artist

00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,490
now now I need a connectivity stack now

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,770
I need an IP stack or something else

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,210
that's a posteriori there and I think

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,490
the important word is really it's

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,930
communing with community maintained and

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,370
it's a commodity some companies will

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,400
still think you can make money with

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,630
these types of things but reality is

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,580
liters has been a commodity since a long

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,200
time and if you think you can sell a

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,370
little speck I don't think gonna make a

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
lot of money with this so there's a lot

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,780
of commodity in there and this goes for

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,150
an IP you six tag six low support thread

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,650
support and science a lot of technology

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,669
that is just they are the

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,900
differentiation happens with the

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,200
application that you build on top of you

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,200
what you do

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,420
so that's force F and I think there's

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,130
been a bunch of zephyr talks already

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,510
this today and there will be a couple of

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,070
more where you can actually learn a bit

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,860
more in toward I think if I'm gonna

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,790
describe the other this one s is fr both

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,780
some way and one of the rules they can

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,920
go there if you need to learn something

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,060
getting to the hardware side of this

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,000
talk which is interesting

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:59,590
so the BBC took one of the bots and they

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,610
built one of these funny ones I get a

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,500
little of this detail what it actually

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,710
is so they had the idea that they want

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,090
to do something for education and they

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,320
went around okay we need to get people a

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,210
little bit technically more involved and

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,370
have them tinker around in the maker

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,680
community we have big boss like

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,030
Raspberry Pi minnowboard and so on and

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,890
so forth we can actually do a lot of

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,210
things with it running Linux well maniac

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,620
should go into the name better space it

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,000
became a lot more complicated to

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,010
actually get a small board where you can

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,090
have something really small and can run

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,340
on a coin cell battery or something

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,380
smaller trying to run a window board and

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,180
appoints the battery you how badly

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,910
failed so you need a big battery pack

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,440
where same as the Raspberry Pi so that

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,360
deity okay let's get something out there

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,780
and they actually gave one of these

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,880
boards to I think every seventh grader

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,020
in the UK got one for free so they just

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,310
built them and then sent them on and

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,170
after that when they started selling I

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,570
think they go around like between ten or

00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,890
fifteen bucks right now so they're

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,870
really easy to come by and they're kind

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,010
of nice and the reason why I'm seeing

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,140
that kind of nice because they put a lot

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,480
of things together that you can't get in

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,460
the same package so you have two

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,190
programmable buttons you can do

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,840
something with it VfL 5x5 LED matrix on

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,850
there which is kind of nice you have

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,050
extra pin outputs that you can use and

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,410
you can even short them with your

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,660
fingers if you want to press them you

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,450
have an accelerometer and a compass on

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,380
there as well you have a battery day

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,050
plus you can easily hook up a battery

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,780
and then charge the battery and then you

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,060
have an arm cortex-m zero with a

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,860
Bluetooth low-energy

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,810
support built-in

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,180
not excellent that's what you're getting

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,039
all with it price point they put looked

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,229
at this one it's only 60 megahertz and

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,460
only 16 K of RAM so they took the lower

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,560
end so that's what you're getting into

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,699
but fundamentally a lot of things to toy

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,979
with if you just want to have an

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,889
education tool we have a matrix display

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,990
we can show like some characters or show

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,340
arrows or just do some indication you

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,870
have buttons to press you can hook them

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,490
up with the pins to some other sensors

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,689
that you want touched it any of next

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,919
four meter and the compass already

00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,680
built-in so you can use them to actually

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,090
do movements on surface and you can do

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,340
it better E power and they're shipping

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,250
them with battery packs we just problems

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,469
so all in all a really nice combined

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,029
package which is great if you want

00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,639
actually just tinker with something or

00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,949
give it to as I said they did their

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,550
seventh graders let them play with it

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:17,400
the only thing I found a little bit

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,900
weird on this one is the problem really

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,759
what they decided to do with the

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,259
software so the hardware's pretty much

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,569
open to tell you what it is that you can

00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,039
easily get it for sheep apart from the

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,000
software side they decided right you

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,550
know we're gonna take the whole

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,860
operating system pretty much closed

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,089
sauce they built a Bluetooth stack and

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,620
they have built an operating system in

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,969
there and it said okay you can build

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,649
your applications but that's the only

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,000
thing you can do if you actually want to

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,769
do anything with the great stuff you

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
have in there and do something I want to

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,380
learn something leaders I want to do

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,790
some security researcher what I want to

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,720
do anything else and figure out how

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,269
things actually work

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,490
you were actually locked out you could

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,920
access them remotely and trigger the

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,750
leads or read out the status of the

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,250
buttons or you can load some scripts in

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,660
there so it was pretty much the

00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,370
arena-style thing where you can have

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,620
some sort of high-level language and

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,519
then do something with it which is great

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,899
if you want to get some people

00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,540
interested anything for seventh graders

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,459
is great but you could actually do so

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,290
much more with this one if you would get

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,089
access to the rest of the hardware and

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,380
that's where at this point funder means

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,269
ever comes in so we actually have the

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,649
top one with a lot to play with the

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:16,830
bottom one you have actually no access

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,320
to

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:23,399
whatsoever and this changed

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,810
fundamentally with zephyr so we haven't

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,180
self-application Basri nothing different

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,800
wheels quite a different location but

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,690
good you get the full source code for

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,550
the Zephyr Bluetooth low-energy host

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,200
deck which you can run and replace all

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,000
the top parts that you have can be seen

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,130
you get full open source for the British

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,480
controller sites you can excessively the

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,089
radio and do some other things with it

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,339
that the chip actually supports but

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,230
nobody would ever previously let you and

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,399
do something with it and you obviously

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,110
have the still deserve for courtesy if

00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,670
there or who is primitives and can do

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,800
something with it accessing the

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,140
thermometer on the chip itself which

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,110
they don't even exposed to so you can do

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,579
a lot of things with this one and open

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,410
more potential on this hardware that's

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,519
wearing cheap an equation to to begin

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,290
with and now it can be even more

00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,940
dedication to a for higher education and

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,519
you cannot get a get easy access on play

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,440
with it I don't think you were going to

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,839
start now we're actually playing with

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:18,329
this one so we can see what's going on

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,310
there so you need the Zephyr SDK and

00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,470
once you have the server is DK you can

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,149
actually get really quickly started get

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,440
the SDK it's a tarball it's nicely built

00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,180
together one of the big advantage of

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,070
surprise that the SDK team a gives you

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,510
the SDK for all the architectures

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,520
together you install it once it's a

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,980
little bit big but once you could over

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,720
yourself and actually install a couple

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,399
of hundred megabyte and install it after

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,649
that one you can swap between

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,740
architectures quite easily and move for

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,810
mix 86 to Ark without just only changing

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,550
the port so you need to get to the

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,649
Zephyr directory and then pretty much

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,450
save it sample program you go to compile

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,070
and then just tell it the board and the

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,180
board definition is already there you

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,320
don't have to build your own watch and

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,050
if initial it's already there's BBC

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,089
micro bit you already put this in you

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,800
build it and then the only thing you

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,050
need to erase the flash and then you

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,839
flash it into the chip and then you can

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,930
access the console on that one

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,910
and that's where you're getting it and I

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:16,069
hopefully from trying the demo no this

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:18,189
will actually work so of course much old

00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:18,189
on

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,320
okay

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,370
I think it becomes readable know what

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,080
so let's get this one attached either

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,450
they can operate battery but pretty much

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:55,040
you ever micro USB adapter you guys on

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:55,040
attach to it and that's about it

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,160
so it just built the sample that gives

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,750
you access to the button and puts the

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,750
button stayed out onto the console

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,370
oh sorry nobody realized that off about

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,000
actually to release the memory or

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,000
release the trip

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,290
note the application

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,010
as you can see this goes really quickly

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,050
at the end so you can do a couple of

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,720
iterations you can do something wrong

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,310
throughout the terminal and then you can

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,810
start pressing the buttons on these ones

00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,030
and then it will just tell you that the

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,560
bubble casts were this time a couple of

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,760
laps our demo really quickly and once

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
you have the SDK installed you have a

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,270
really quick turnaround time so it's not

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,410
compile and wait a long time run this on

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,410
this it's already thing really quick

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,080
so let's try a little bit more of the

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,080
fancier ones

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,209
so

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,450
so sorry

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,450
I have to build it first

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,740
so obviously we have a couple of hooters

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,269
examples in their thoughts but you want

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,369
to do a simple beacon like an Eddystone

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,910
beacon you can take a beacon example and

00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,910
just build it

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,480
you raise the trip

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:10,079
flash it on there I will automate a

00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:12,209
restart and now you pretty much the EBC

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,470
me to my cab it acts as a beacon phone

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:19,589
Eddystone now so and to prove this

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:23,039
actually forgot to take off my lovely

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:27,049
USB dongle your poori can scan for this

00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,049
one as well but I need to put in

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,730
Nadja

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,220
I think it says is fr test peeking or

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,220
something I easily find it

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,139
let's just scan for it see if it finds

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,329
it oh yeah by the way the Hilton has

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,070
every door lock is a ble device so we'll

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:16,680
see a lot of ble devices in this hotel

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:22,769
let's cruise it up a little bit oh you

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:29,149
know it actually does work so I did this

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:33,870
earlier to demo this one I found the

00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:35,850
beacon and always now it becomes a

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,899
little harder to find it too many

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,899
devices around here

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:47,220
it will broadcast the Zephyr project URL

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,220
so you could pick up the UN

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,220
you said you know

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,220
can you

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,570
oh that is make sure it's a good idea so

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,510
there you get your Eddie stone beacon

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,550
and if you were decode this or need to

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,020
make this biggest one and if you would

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,030
decode this one you would see that this

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,760
is actually the Google Eddie stone you

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:20,140
know and as well as as quickly as that

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,400
you've turned the Mayan BBC micro bit in

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,000
a beacon I can use it and you put

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,000
batteries you can walk around with it

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
okay

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,900
so let's do a little bit more complex

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:44,230
one sure go ahead

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,230
oh you want to see the coasters you sure

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,190
so that's the code that you need to

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,410
actually build a beacon so you include

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,820
the blue disk at us you build your

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,170
beacon structure so they a couple of

00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,670
extra defines with this one if you have

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,740
to build them so it's advertising data

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,010
and it's documented how you actually

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,790
build them together and after that one

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,590
the only thing you really have to do is

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,840
you enable bluetooth so you have the BT

00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,040
neighbor called in Zephyr and then you

00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,290
get a callback when this actually

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,610
completed and once it completed you just

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,780
say okay and I'm starting advertising

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,670
you tell it what your how to advertise

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,200
it it's not connectable and then you

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,730
give it the data area that you just

00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,870
previously blown and that's all you

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,870
really need so

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,890
47 lines of code and that's including

00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:37,510
comments that a copyright head on the

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,510
topic so rather easy

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:50,310
so let's get let's try to turn the

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,690
Eddystone into into a mouse so there's

00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,360
an example in there where we actually

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,530
pretend to be a mouse and with that one

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,450
then you could actually find it with

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,310
operations Mike was ten or really knocks

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,330
all windows and then you can see how he

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:05,790
can actually connect to it same thing

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:14,030
procedures again pick the application

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:14,030
build it chippie race program it in

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,460
and as soon as its programming will

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:29,650
reboot the chip and then it will start

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:29,650
it as a device so if I then what just

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,820
and then you see a test mouse device

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,200
pills they are I'm starting the Minicon

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,640
now as well so that would give me the

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,180
pin on this one so I'm starting this one

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,580
as well

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,580
oh of course only try to repair with it

00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,770
I was moaning so someone I'm starting

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,330
the mini comics wallet and then you can

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,550
actually get the passkey that we have to

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,140
put in but if I do this in a public

00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,280
space and people already see that I'm

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,120
advertising they're trying to already

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,760
pair with me so I assume someone

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,510
unsuccessfully did this before me as you

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,510
see from the status

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,380
and then you pretty much turned all the

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,380
Michael bit in a mouse device

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,190
so you can also turn it into a heart

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,190
rate monitor

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,780
you're building the heartrate

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:00,980
application and same goes again chippie

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,980
rice measured in

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,390
and now it's a hardware device and

00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:30,000
hopefully nobody tries to mess with me

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,000
right now so I can actually use it

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,950
trying to attach this from

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,540
trying to find it now let's see if

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,540
available

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,890
the uprising is already connected for me

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,720
and I can't find it anymore okay

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:08,100
let's see if we're gonna give this

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:09,390
another chance live demos they the

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,720
multicast bit has a different meaning in

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,720
religious

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:35,160
and that's what finds a lot of devices

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,160
here haven't found that the home diet

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:53,510
it remembered it from the last time but

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:55,490
I don't know if okay so luckily I

00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,440
remember the address from the testings

00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,540
so it went on this one did the service

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,430
discovery and you have it now and then

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:06,470
you can have you just select attribute

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,460
for the hard way it so let's find the

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:14,710
heart rate heart rate measurement so

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,710
that's zero zero six zero zero seven

00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:22,849
you select that one and then you send

00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:24,320
put notifications on and then it keeps

00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:25,700
telling you the heart rate so this is

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,169
obviously fake to this example because

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,759
we have no sensor attached to it but he

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:30,019
would attach a sense of it read your

00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,669
heart rate and now you actually get the

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,619
heart rate order those are unique and

00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:36,379
money tourism and this will even work

00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:39,369
with any application that has a native

00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,369
heart rates of Claud

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,570
you can also read out the attributes so

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:55,570
let's take one for that's a model number

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,570
information that's 12

00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,859
you just can't do a read on it and then

00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,789
tell see okay this running on the mall

00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,350
you're gonna have trip with that

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,479
packaging because we put the device

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,559
information into this sample as well can

00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:08,669
read them out symbols for battery

00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,669
information and so that's impossible

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,780
and then it disconnects from it

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:29,770
so there's one nice feature that these

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,770
chips actually have thermometer on it

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,840
which doesn't measure the environment or

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,320
temperature and measure the temperature

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,320
of the chip itself

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,660
again notice in

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,450
this case it just only puts out the

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,760
temperature on the console you start

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,470
your terminal again and it reads out the

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,720
temperatures around 35 degrees I think

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,220
in the hotel Astor was wrongfully to

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,990
decrease so it runs a little bit hotter

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,160
now since I've been using it I said it's

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:21,860
not the environment is the temperature

00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:23,720
of the ship itself and obviously now you

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,550
can start combining these ones put these

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,630
out take the extra meter put it out on

00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,950
the hit device etc one other neat thing

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,480
is since we have full control over their

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,770
software we can actually say oh yeah

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,240
it's great to run the application on it

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,620
but maybe actually want to do some

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,970
hacking within and some other tools you

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,040
can actually turn this into a bluetooth

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,050
dongle and attach it to your Lin oxide

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,510
so I'm taking this small one back off

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,470
again and building one of the other

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,470
samples that we have

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,890
there's a sample that is called H tau

00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,670
art so what it fundamentally does it

00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:00,230
turns the console into a full HCI device

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,630
and you can adjust attach it to the UNIX

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,130
system and then I use that ship and play

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,590
with it it means you can actually modify

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:10,370
the firmware and do modifications and do

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:13,760
some hacking over the year it goes the

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:18,190
same way you just build it should be

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,190
race fashion back in

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,660
don't leave so the little site currently

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:36,530
has no devices attached and on the other

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:39,140
side you just go then okay take that

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:46,690
device on the under UART and attach it

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:46,690
to the system oh that's not good

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,000
that's not working

00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,500
well not right

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,460
that looks better so Latino it's kind of

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,810
went through all the setup so

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,190
fundamentally treating the whole device

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,190
now just as a pass-through

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,840
and again you can stay

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,540
and you would scan for devices you don't

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,530
see them thousand thousand dogs around

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,030
watch means at this point you can start

00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,470
tuning with a firmware but you don't

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,880
have to actually rely on actually doing

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,170
the application you can run the

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,280
application on Linux but a fiction do

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,740
some other things they are and can do

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,450
things from specs that only released yet

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,710
to further development or something at

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,600
some features that you might be missing

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,280
and sort of the force and move this as a

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,460
flexible test result by combining Linux

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:54,790
and so far together to do something ok

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,790
any questions on that go ahead please

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:07,960
so you can buy cheap men sniffer so the

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:11,200
chip how it operates it operates on one

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,340
frequency at a time which means if you

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,169
want to just monitor on something on a

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,720
single frequency you can get everything

00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,790
on the frequency really easy but ludus

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,470
uses 40 channels which means you have to

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,660
mail one in 40 frequencies the chip

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,880
can't do 43 pins at the same time for

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:31,660
that one need your wife instead 4 or 40

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:35,049
of these that you put together you can

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,030
it's just not a high quality sniffer so

00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:39,549
you you will miss packets that you would

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,750
normally get so you have to deal with

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,100
the error rate on this one but you can

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:46,630
build fundamentally isn't it all of that

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:49,720
last one now we don't have one in zephyr

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,070
yet so people are invited to actually do

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,830
something about it and put one in but

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,429
it's possible it doesn't replace white

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,429
pants never go

00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:11,700
go ahead what's the red code somebody

00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:16,440
you could miss you had a more complex

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,440
application the running sort of

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,920
yes you can yeah you can also run I

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,960
would advise you to go to yuan head back

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,760
stop tomorrow because he shows we'll

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,130
show you how to do this in emulator and

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,240
host all can use local hardware put like

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,040
a bluetooth dongle put that in the

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,500
emulator and then still use it so we can

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,360
do a lot of pre-work in an emulator

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,710
without ever touching Harper even while

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,110
touching the heart was really fast

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,030
there's also extra it wanted some other

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,650
chips that have extra ICS in there for

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,230
control we can actually have extra debug

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,090
information coming out and attach to the

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,620
JTAG to the zeg on these ones and so on

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,840
and so forth it's a lot of possibilities

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,250
I leave this to you on for tomorrow to

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,200
give the debilitation but yes

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,790
fundamentally you can start in QA more

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,770
really small and when you happy then you

00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:02,030
only touch the hardware this was more

00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:07,410
like touching the hardware right away

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:09,360
okay um we went through the demo part so

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,950
this was just a pure demos that we

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,300
actually have published and then gives

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,590
you basic idea how to use therefore how

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,400
to use the Bluetooth side on it and how

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,750
you get started I think if you are

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,510
interested and want to work on this one

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,760
easy ways take the button example take

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,680
the peripheral example for the mouse put

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,420
it together and actually start using it

00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,560
so you have a with two button mouse left

00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,030
and right but two buttons are they are

00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,270
left or right button you build easy

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,530
clicker that you can use if you have a

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,740
question go ahead I'm happy to answer

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,740
them

00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,240
yes so I heard it will make it over to

00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,650
the US as well it's easy to get in

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,809
Europe you just got Amazon I click buy

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,210
that comes next day I try to actually

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,070
look on this one earlier Amazon us are

00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:59,030
not yet but I've been told it actually

00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,030
is making over the phone as well

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,830
I I think so I think this will be

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:15,360
available and I heard they weren't gonna

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,380
make it here in ability so as I said

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,880
earlier I take the button and the hit

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,530
example put them together and actually

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,360
build your own Mouse or clicker with

00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,770
this one really easy you have an extra

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,000
mint on there you can fundamentally also

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,770
then go one step further I'm using so

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,179
metals actually actually can mouse

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,440
motion by just moving the mouse in the

00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:31,040
air so this is really up to you guys

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,240
take something more build something and

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,040
get involved some with the South Stream

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,990
and see how actually it works well and

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,100
you really only have to focus on the

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,420
application because all the Buddhist

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,980
parts are taken care of you won't see

00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,480
this is really simple

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,010
the thermometer informations are short

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,179
can be easily exposed over cuts or so

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,130
you want to use something okay measure

00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:50,309
the chip temperature application title

00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:52,530
thing there's a five by five LED matrix

00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:54,690
in there start making use of these LEDs

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,830
and display the current times you can

00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,210
build a really cheap time clock that

00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:59,220
actually takes that time from your phone

00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,480
and Buddha's Orias profiles for this one

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,370
where the phone can expose the time and

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,590
you can use it from your profile device

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,110
so it becomes your mini watch or

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,400
something that has the time from your

00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,660
phone and if you want to go a little bit

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,520
further and actually read into this one

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,570
I think the fact my five LED matrix will

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,280
be really nice to use the upper

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,480
notification service every time you get

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,550
a notification you can squat it through

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,470
your five by five LED matrix and I'll

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,570
just have this on your desk and get you

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,860
does all distracted all the time so if

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,740
you don't want to watch yourself so

00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,270
there's a lot of possibilities that are

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,490
just easy to do and I think the

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,840
combination of the LEDs the two buttons

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,880
and the extra pins gives you a lot of

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,470
options to go with it without having to

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,030
actually figure out and get it dedicated

00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:41,820
hard we all get more expensive hardware

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:43,590
is astrology so we gave you the control

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,640
back off the micro bit if you want to do

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,890
something more with it then actually

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,220
have just an application type of thing

00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:51,570
or write and web application thing and

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,340
you can do whatever you want with it so

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,410
at this point is like really if you want

00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,850
to do something that go toy with it and

00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,360
I hope it makes it over to Leah's really

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,920
soon so you can start and I think in

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,090
Europe Tagawa between

00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,140
fifteen years right now so they're

00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,620
really cheap that's all I have thank you

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:16,310
very much

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:16,310
and for the questions that's good

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,790
now they're watchin designer for toning

00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,650
the Nordics often guys and they build it

00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:29,260
on top of the nordic soft device that's

00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:31,920
what there was a ranger on there you

00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,920
think he was first

00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:41,090
micro USB so that's all it is

00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,349
they're all

00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:54,190
so I think the only alternative you

00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:57,160
would have would be the mine you'd stick

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,030
or the minut operating system all the

00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,440
other ones you would have the

00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,540
fundamental problem you might get it

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,580
running but you're missing than a ble

00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,260
stack and that really doesn't help you

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,360
if you want to tinker with the feeling

00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,220
side of things because that's rather

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,520
chip shine because it built-in really

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,520
radio

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,309
go in

00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,770
so as far as I know the BBC is really

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,060
actively pushing this one but it's

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,470
building with their own tools like

00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,850
there's an online tool for this one that

00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,990
they can load things in there or the

00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:42,120
education stuff they never intended it

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:45,060
to be used like this so but I think it

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,320
will actually get at someone a seven

00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,450
grader gets bought as well if they have

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,530
all done and create a couple of buttons

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,700
so they can do a little bit more now if

00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,260
you get an a higher rate so I think this

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,870
is pretty important it doesn't have to

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,670
be the BBC microwave by the way Zephyr

00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,290
supports a lot of ports you can get a

00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,190
lot of ports it's just one of them that

00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,350
has with the led

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,670
Wi-Fi five LED matrix it gives you a lot

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,050
of options to do things by the other

00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,970
ones you have a single allocated and a

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,710
single button here you have to use the

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,970
extra pins and you have a nice package

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,710
coming together that's the interesting

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,300
part but there are tons of boards out

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,700
there that Zephyr supports right now the

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,340
list of ports I think is 30 or 40 volts

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,050
by now and they have all the board

00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,639
definitions upstream and you can do

00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,350
whatever they want them and some of them

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,179
have external or connector so if you're

00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,980
like then one of up into soaring and

00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,990
soaring something on it great go for

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,409
that one I think this one is just a nice

00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,610
start for kids or a little bit older

00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,230
children actually to get a little bit

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,429
hey we want to do something more I'd be

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,429
honest you know stuff works

00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,820
this

00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,060
other boats will work executed the the

00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:55,520
only difference instead of just typing

00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:00,349
bored BBC micro bit you would type or

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,520
96b nitrogen or Intel Centrino 101 you

00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,720
just changed the broad definition you

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,460
not have to change a code it will all

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,020
work we make sure it works across the

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,280
board you're not supposed to touch the

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,200
ble stack if you want to change your

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,440
hardware

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,440
[Music]

00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:19,400
Adrina one on works as well the only

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,570
difference with adrena one works as well

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,130
the Edina one is the only difference

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,990
because it has a separate it has

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,550
multiple cause this is a single called

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,750
the adrenal one has three cores so you

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,490
have to flesh every quarter you have to

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,680
build fr for every coin dividual II and

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,890
then flash it but will work exactly the

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,890
same

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,310
any other questions if non then thanks

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,310
