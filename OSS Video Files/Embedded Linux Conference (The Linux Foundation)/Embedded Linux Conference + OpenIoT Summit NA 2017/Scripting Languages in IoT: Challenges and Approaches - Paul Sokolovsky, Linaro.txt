	Scripting Languages in IoT: Challenges and Approaches - Paul Sokolovsky, Linaro

Very High-Level Languages (VHLLs, also known as scripting languages) posses the well-deserved place in the development process for desktop, servers, web, and to a lesser extent mobile systems. They offer such benefits as rapid prototyping, speed of the development, vast high-level libraries, ease of maintenance and support. The idea to use VHLLs for deeply embedded development, to benefit from the traits above, is a recent hot topic in IoT. This presentation surveys the challenges of using VHLLs on hundreds KB of ROM/tens KB of RAM devices, and compares different approaches of bringing VHLLs to IoT, based on the examples of MicroPython and JerryScript + Zephyr.js projects. Also includes recent development update for the mentioned projects.

About Paul Sokolovsky
I'm working as an IoT engineer at Linaro (http://www.linaro.org/). In this role, I contribute to Zephyr RTOS and related projects (MicroPython, JerryScript, Zephyr.js). My previous experience includes Android system level and build system knowledge, porting Linux to handheld devices, continuous integration systems (Jenkins, Gerrit, etc.), and OpenSource projects advocacy/support. I contribute to, and run myself, many OpenSource projects, https://github.com/pfalcon .
