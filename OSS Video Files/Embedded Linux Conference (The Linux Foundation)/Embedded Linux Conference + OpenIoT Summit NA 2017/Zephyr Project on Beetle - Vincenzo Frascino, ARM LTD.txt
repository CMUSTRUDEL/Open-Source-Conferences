Description: 
	Zephyr Project on Beetle - Vincenzo Frascino, ARM LTD

The Zephyr Project is a small, scalable, real-time operating system for use on resource-constrained systems that support multiple architectures.

Zephyrâ€™s modularity allows it to run in as little as 8K of RAM and helps create an IoT solution that meets all of your device needs, regardless of architecture.

ARM Beetle is the test-chip implementation of the IoT subsystem for Cortex-M processors that allows design teams to create IoT endpoints faster and with lower risk.

In this session, I am going to give an overview of the current status of Zephyr OS running on Beetle and provide a deep dive on how to port a new platform into Zephyr with examples related to the ARM platform. The Demo session will contain a set of examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the chip.
