Description: 
	What Can Vulkan do for You? - Jason Ekstrand, Intel

Vulkan is a new 3D graphics and compute API from the Khronos group, the same industry working group that has maintains OpenGL, OpenGL ES, OpenCL, and many other graphics-related APIs. In this presentation, Jason Ekstrand will discuss some of the key differences between Vulkan and it's predecessors and some of the advantages that Vulkan can bring to embedded graphics development. Rather than simply being another OpenGL iteration, Vulkan has been designed from scratch to better match modern hardware, be leaner and more efficient, and support modern software programming practices such as multithreaded rendering. Jason will also give an overview of the efforts that are going on in the open-source graphics community and within Intel to support Vulkan with open-source applications, tools, and drivers.
