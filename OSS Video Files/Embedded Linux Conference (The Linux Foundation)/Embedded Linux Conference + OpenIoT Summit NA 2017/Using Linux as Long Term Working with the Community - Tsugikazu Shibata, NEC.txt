	Using Linux as Long Term Working with the Community - Tsugikazu Shibata, NEC

For Embedded System, Linux is being a default choice of its kernel. Everyone already understood that they need a kernel be able to use long term and LTS and LTSI is being a great choice.

Early 2015, there was a discussion about LTS version and decided that 4.4 kernel was LTS against the regular release cadence. Industry was bit confused for that because their plan was expected LTS will be released some more month later. Also, further discussion happened for future release of LTS.

This presentation is to share the thoughts of the kernel community and how industry works with the community to successfully use Linux kernel as long term. Also, to share LTSI release plan with its release process.
