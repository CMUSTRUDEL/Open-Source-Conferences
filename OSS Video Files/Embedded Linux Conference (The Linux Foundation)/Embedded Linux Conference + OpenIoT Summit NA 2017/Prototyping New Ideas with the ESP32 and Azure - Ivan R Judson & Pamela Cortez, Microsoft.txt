	Prototyping New Ideas with the ESP32 and Azure - Ivan R Judson & Pamela Cortez, Microsoft

Prototyping New Ideas with the ESP32 and Azure - The Internet of Things is a large complex space with solutions provided by many organizations for many components; from devices, sdks, management tools, gateways, protocols, cloud storage and processing, complex event processing, data management, analytics, machine learning to solutions that include all of these technologies. Figuring out what's necessary to get started converting an idea to a real prototype and validate that it works -- end-to-end -- is a daunting task facing many. In this talk an idea will be converted to a prototype including the end-to-end software using the inexpensive but fully capable ESP32 and Azure. During this process, the open source tools and sdks will be highlighted, providing a low cost experience for product prototyping.
