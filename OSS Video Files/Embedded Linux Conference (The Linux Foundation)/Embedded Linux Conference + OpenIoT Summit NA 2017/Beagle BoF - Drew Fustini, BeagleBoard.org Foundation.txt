Description: 
	Beagle BoF - Drew Fustini, BeagleBoard.org Foundation

Jason Kridner of Texas Instruments will be attending. He is the co-founder of BeagleBoard.org Foundation, the BeagleBone and the BeagleBoard. In addition, Robert C. Nelson will be there too. Robert is the developer of the Debian images for BeagleBoard.org and maintains the Linux kernel used for those images. I'd like to attract any active users or prospective users of BeagleBone or BeagleBoard and generate discussion about what their needs our and how we might find common solutions.
