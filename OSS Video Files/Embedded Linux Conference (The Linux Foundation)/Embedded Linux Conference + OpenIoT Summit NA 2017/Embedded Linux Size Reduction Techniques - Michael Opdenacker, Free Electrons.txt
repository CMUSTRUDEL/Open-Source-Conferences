Playlist: Embedded Linux Conference + OpenIoT Summit NA 2017
Description: 
	Embedded Linux Size Reduction Techniques - Michael Opdenacker, Free Electrons

Are you interested in running Linux in a system with very small RAM
and storage resources? Or are you just trying to make the Linux kernel
and its filesystem as small as possible, typically to boot faster?

This talk will detail approaches for reducing the size of the kernel,
of individual applications and of the whole filesystem. Benchmarks
will you show how much you can expect to save with each approach.

Michael will also try to collect valuable experience from participants
to the talk, as well as ideas for further improvements, to add to the
materials he will publish after the conference.

Disclaimer: the only thing Michael won't try to reduce is the
size of his presentation, as there are many resources worth exploring.
