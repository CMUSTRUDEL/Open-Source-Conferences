Hi, I'm Megan Byrd-Sanicki

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,990
and I'm a manager at Google's Open Source Programs Office

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,270
and I am so glad that you are joining me today for this important topic

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,590
open source sustainability, and I want to thank you for making time

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,430
because we all use open source so heavily now.

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,440
It's really important that we make sure it's future proofed

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,680
and sustainable moving forward, and we can only do that together.

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,190
So today I'm going to talk about what is open source sustainability

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,140
and how do we combat sustainability issues?

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,110
And we're also going to talk about how Google is contributing and how you can as well.

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,300
So the first thing to point out is that open source has clearly won.

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,700
You can see from this survey that 95 percent of 1,000 IT decision makers

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,350
said that open source is not only used in their organization,

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,780
but it's strategic to their organization.

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,530
So we are all relying on open source in so many ways, and as I've mentioned before

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,439
it's just really important that it is a viable option for us into the future

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,670
and that means we need to make it sustainable.

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,189
But what does sustainability really mean?

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:40,270
In short, it's about projects being resilient in the face of change.

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,210
And this is well defined by a group called SustainOSS

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,700
which I really believe is a great definition for sustainability.

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,710
You see, open source is so much more than code.

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,670
That's just the end result.

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,400
It requires certain ingredients to come together to make that code.

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,579
And I like to use the simple framework of people, process, and technology.

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,550
And what I mean by that is that we need people to build the project

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,860
and we need them to have all kinds of talents and skills

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,330
and backgrounds to do that.

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,239
And we need them to work together

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,989
and work together well, with clear, healthy processes.

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,140
So they're really efficient and effective as they're collaborating.

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,560
And then the last areas that they need

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,020
a whole set of tools to facilitate their work

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,980
whether that's contributor tools or communication tools.

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,450
And you need these three areas set up for success and to all be resilient.

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,650
And when you don't have that

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,710
then what happens is you start to see cracks in the project.

00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,709
And unfortunately, the project starts to fall down on its ability to deliver great code

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,640
and it can eventually just die on the vine, as they say.

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,620
And so you really do need these ingredients to be healthy

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,340
so that they are resilient in the face of change.

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,370
And that change can come in the form of many forces.

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,690
The first one that's commonly known in the industry is "Tragedy of the Commons".

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,510
And that's simply when you have people that have started to contribute

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,269
and then a lot of people who are downloading and using the software

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,489
and those original contributors might be getting tired

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,970
and those new users are not coming back to contribute as well.

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,410
And eventually you just have an imbalance

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,060
and you don't have enough new talent to leave those that are ready to move on.

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,489
And there's just all kinds of stress fractures associated with that.

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,760
The other force that creates change and impact in a project is

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,739
how a project goes through different stages, through lifecycle stages.

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,831
So it starts small and might just be a few people working on it.

00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,230
And then it gets bigger and bigger

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,730
and it starts to need governance to tell people how to work well together.

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,769
It needs more process.

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,269
It needs different kinds of talent.

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,500
And if it doesn't have the right ingredients at each stage

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
it's just not going to progress to the next stage.

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,419
It might even go backwards.

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,050
So that's another area that is pretty common with projects.

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,920
Another force that impacts projects is changes in the competitive landscape.

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,630
So you might have a project that solves a certain problem

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,550
and then another project comes out that solves that problem in a different way.

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,680
Eventually if that other project is more popular or solves the problem better

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,880
you're going to lose contributors to this other project.

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,150
You're going to lose end users to that project

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,690
and you're going to see just an overall decline in engagement.

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,900
And so that's an unfortunate outcome that can happen

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,550
when you see shifts in the competitive landscape.

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,570
Another common area that creates a lot of change

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,880
disruptive change, are global trends.

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,430
And the most common one, the most recent one right now, is COVID.

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,520
COVID started end projects that were relying on in-person events

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,550
and the funding from those events found that they had to cancel the events

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,449
and they were scrambling to find money

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,750
to keep their foundations afloat, to pay for servers.

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,460
They were also finding it really hard to suddenly move into

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,729
a fully online community.

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,100
How do you run meetups online?

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,139
Where do you get the tools and the best practices?

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:49,590
And so there's lots of headwinds like this and others that I haven't mentioned, but

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,670
it is true that projects have to deal with a lot, whether they realize it or not

00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,560
as they're getting started and moving through their journey.

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,770
And it's also important to note that no project's sustainability needs are the same.

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,850
Every one is in different places.

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,580
And unfortunately, there isn't a tool out there to just tell the community

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,389
"Oh you're having resilience issues."

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,970
And "This is where you're starting to see cracks in the system."

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,889
And "This is what you need to do."

00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:20,889
That doesn't exist.

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,520
You have to rely on people being very engaged in your project

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,300
and actively identifying these.

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
And there's no training.

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,039
It's not something that people normally do.

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,990
And so there's just a real gap here in what can happen

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,090
and what you can do proactively to get ahead

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,810
of some of these stress fractures in your project.

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,680
So how do we make projects sustainable?

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,310
What happens when you don't have sustainable projects?

00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,380
You end up having lots of challenges and pain

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,840
and I broke them out into a couple of categories.

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,580
The first one's around people.

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,390
You have pain with maintainers and contributors.

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,830
So you could have burnout when there's just not enough help coming.

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,250
PRs can languish and there might be great ideas

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,580
in some of those pull requests that just never get to see the light of day

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,580
because there's just no one there to take it to the next level.

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,610
You might see other issues like a toxic community

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,370
because there just hasn't been time to really create a welcoming space with good values

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,419
and good ways of interacting with each other, good governance to ensure that happens

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,750
a code of conduct, things like that.

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,980
You can also have challenges with end users.

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,460
They eventually might just lose trust of your project.

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Maybe they have security concerns

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,139
or they start seeing there's lower engagement with your community

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,470
and they're like, "Yeah, I don't know if I want to invest in

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,009
a project that has declining community members and engagement."

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,050
Because that is a metric that they look at.

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,830
It also might be that there isn't enough talent in a project.

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:18,639
It might just be totally indexed for coders, but not enough tech writers.

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,340
And suddenly a project finds itself with poor or lacking documentation.

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,449
And end users need that documentation

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,430
in order to figure out how to use and adopt the software.

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,080
Another area is code infrastructure.

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,990
So when a project isn't resilient and they don't have, let's say, enough funding

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,699
they may not be able to get the infrastructure

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,350
they need to support the project.

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,010
They may not be able to pay for servers

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,990
or the tests that they need, and it could impact their release cadence.

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,630
Another area where you might see challenges

00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,800
is the foundations that support the community.

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,420
And a lot of it has to do with funding challenges.

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,040
If they just don't have enough funding

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,399
they can't serve their mission to support the community

00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,580
or help accelerate innovation within the community.

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,560
And perhaps they aren't able to fund the legal

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,709
and financial support that they need to be a healthy organization.

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,610
And so these are just all kinds of different challenges that you might see

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,550
when a project isn't resilient.

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:39,950
And so what do you do when projects have these kinds of challenges

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,700
and no project is the same in terms of their needs?

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,300
One answer that

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,980
we have found is that diversity is a great anecdote

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,360
for building resilience in a project.

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,010
And it's diversity on a couple different axes

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,060
diverse community members and diverse contributions.

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,709
You see, some people think that there's kind of a silver bullet.

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,839
"Oh, we just need to get end users to contribute that

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,430
and that will solve the problem."

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,700
Others might say, "We just need to invest in better security

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,230
and that will make projects more sustainable."

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,579
And these are all correct answers, but they're all very tactical answers.

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,510
And you realize there's a bunch of them.

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,410
When you pull the lens back

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,070
you realize it's really about diversity, that builds resilience.

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,890
And let me tell you what I mean.

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:45,140
So when you look at diversity in terms of community members

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,570
we are very much talking about

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,870
diversity in terms of including those from the various underrepresented groups

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:03,320
because different perspectives make great solutions, and so you want diverse talent.

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,130
And that's going to require different ingredients to be in place.

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,780
You need a welcoming, safe community that has values in place and governance

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,490
and culture that supports diversity.

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,269
And you need to be very intentional with your outreach

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,320
not just asking your friend to join

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,930
but really reaching out to recruit community members so that you truly have

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,550
a diverse member base.

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,870
And there's so much more that you can do on this front that

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,850
I won't have time to get into

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,839
but I highly recommend you go to all the many resources that are out there.

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,610
The other axis on diversity is different types of contribution

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,560
and I like to use a pretty standard frame, which is time, talent, and treasure.

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,010
You want your contributions diversified in these three areas.

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,350
And this is a framework that comes from the nonprofit world

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,100
and it applies pretty well to open source.

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,459
And the reality is that when you focus on diverse contributions

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,130
you actually get an even more diverse community member base.

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,520
So let me explain what I mean.

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,160
So diverse time and talent come in lots of different ways.

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,670
Like I mentioned before, you don't want just to focus on code.

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,920
And of course you have to build code, but a project requires so many other talents.

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,220
You need those tech writers to write documentation.

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,700
You need mentors to help people learn the contributor experience.

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,120
You need event planners to do meetups and conferences.

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,880
You need board members that have board experience, and so many other talents.

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,800
You simply cannot have a successful project with just coders.

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,959
You also need to be mindful of

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:53,589
where the contributions are coming from.

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,209
Are they hobbyists?

00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,160
Are they

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,420
people that work for open source vendors using the project or end users using

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,550
the project.

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,800
You really want to look across your ecosystem at all

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,750
the different kinds of groups that make up your ecosystem

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,640
and see if you have good representation from all of them contributing back.

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,240
And you also want to look at your global contribution.

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,910
It's important to get people from around the world to contribute

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,740
so that you end up with an end product or an end project that serves

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,730
a global base that will want to adopt this software.

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:41,310
And you can really lower barriers when you have

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,940
more of a global community base.

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
So, for example

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,970
they can write translations so that end users around the world

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,810
can really grab that software

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,279
read the translated documentation, and put it to good use.

00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,740
So that's time and talent.

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,880
You further need to diversify with treasure

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,010
and that just means funding.

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,970
So you need money for tools like servers

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,260
like I mentioned before.

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,460
You might also want money for diversity scholarships.

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,180
You may want to pay maintainers and you need money to do that.

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,230
And it's really important to diversify the funds.

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,820
So you don't want to bring in money in just one way.

00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,200
You don't want to rely just on event sponsorships, for example, ticket revenue.

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,420
We saw this with COVID.

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:36,540
The projects that did rely on this too heavily, found that

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,399
they were really struggling for survival

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,970
and had to come up with new ways to fund their mission work.

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,970
And so you want to think about events

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,360
but you want to think about memberships and donations and grants.

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,950
Maybe you want to have a product.

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,650
And there's other things about treasure as well.

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,920
But when you diversify treasure, time, and talent and you think about that

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,070
and you ask what your project needs now and into the future

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:17,810
you will start building in so much more resiliency into your project by diversifying.

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,839
This is how Google thinks about sustainability

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,970
and we put it into practice every day.

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,269
And that's because we use a lot of open source software.

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,200
We rely on it for our infrastructure

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,730
and for the offerings we make out in the marketplace.

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,440
And so we take giving back very seriously.

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
It's the right thing to do

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,290
and it also future-proofs the open source projects we rely on.

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:48,660
And we have nearly 12,000 Googlers who are contributing to projects

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,130
and that doesn't even include people beyond code and tech writers.

00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:00,740
So it doesn't include our staff members that are serving on boards or planning events.

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,180
And we create thousands of open source projects

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,880
and today we currently manage 2,600 active projects.

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,459
And we rely on a lot of external projects as well

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,320
and we're actually active in

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,410
70,000 GitHub repositories and it's a lot.

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,839
And we care about these projects, too, and make sure we give back.

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,100
We do so in lots of different ways.

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,180
And so I'll kind of just break down some of the ways

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,959
that we are contributing to make open source sustainable.

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,089
So the first example is Go, a really popular language that was developed by Go

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,790
and it has a strong and growing community around it.

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:53,089
We have a group of people that are focused on sustainably stewarding the project

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,310
and making sure everyone's working well together towards these common goals for Go.

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,320
And one of the things that they found, especially during COVID

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,110
was that with this emphasis of online collaboration

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,970
we needed to make the project more welcoming in these online forums

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,090
and there really wasn't training

00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:17,699
and you don't normally get this kind of training to learn how to moderate forums.

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,419
And when you do it poorly, you can make some really bad experiences that are at worst

00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,480
toxic for the community and also just a real distraction

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,210
from these common goals we want to achieve together

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,370
and you end up just focused too much on the daily drama.

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,080
We just didn't want that.

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,230
And so we invested in moderator training

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,940
so that we could help moderators with effective communication, conflict resolution

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,461
code of conduct enforcement.

00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:52,260
And we're really excited to empower these people

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,750
to be much better leaders in these spaces

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,179
and make sure we have a welcoming environment

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,820
so that we can attract diverse community members.

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,270
And we're looking forward to rolling this out to other projects.

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,830
And TensorFlow is another great example

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,990
another project that was developed by Google and has a community created around it.

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:21,630
And we intentionally wanted diverse

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,000
community members as part of this project.

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,190
It does not do anyone good if it's just Googlers working on this project.

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,150
We need input from so many perspectives.

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,960
And so we intentionally designed our governance

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,480
so that our special interest groups always had a balance of Googlers

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,010
and those that don't work at Google.

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:50,049
And that way, decision making has much more perspective and balance

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:54,940
and ensures that we are committed to having this diverse community base.

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:03,620
So we do provide these kinds of services for the projects we

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
create and manage

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,539
but we also have lots of programs to help make projects sustainable

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,940
both the ones we create, the ones we rely on that we don't create

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,750
and even ones we don't use.

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,190
And these programs we just want to share broadly

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,429
because we care about open source

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,510
the whole industry's sustainability and health.

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,039
So a few projects or programs that you might want to check out are OSS Fuzz

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,170
which uncovers security vulnerabilities and stability issues.

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,220
And we have Google Summer of Code.

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,039
It's a long-standing mentoring program that gets students into projects

00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,730
and assigned to mentors so they learn how to

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,929
contribute code well, contribute right.

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:52,880
And it's resulted in a lot of leaders in open source projects

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,320
and it brings in a lot of diverse and new talent into the projects as well.

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,529
Another program to check out that's newer is Season of Docs.

00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,039
It's a lot like Summer of Code

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,000
but it's about matching tech writers to projects

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,010
and making sure that these projects accelerate good documentation

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,850
so they can grow adoption of their other software out in the marketplace within users.

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,500
And there's lots of other programs that you can check out

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,070
and you can go to opensource.google to find out what they are.

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,970
And so we have these long-standing programs and approaches

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,340
but we also know that things creep up.

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,760
These forces of change like COVID just come out of nowhere.

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:48,470
Thus, we attempt to be as nimble as we can to help out when these challenges arise.

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,730
So for COVID, we did a couple of things.

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,250
We reached out to the projects we rely on and simply said, "How can we help?"

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,810
And we sent resources in to help where we could.

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,600
We also knew that many people had to take a break from their projects

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,020
because they were suddenly doing child care or elder care or finding a new job.

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:18,350
So we transitioned our internship program to bring more students into projects

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,030
and assigned them mentors so they could take on some of the load of the work

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,970
and also learn about open source and how that can be a future career path for them.

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,500
And then we also reached out to open source projects on the front lines

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,260
and there were many that needed to accelerate features to make sure we were

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,190
really serving the front lines well.

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,570
So we did a callout, and many people within Google

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,240
heard the call and came out and contributed time

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,440
and talent to projects like COVIDActNow and NextStream and Schema.org.

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,750
And we also help a lot of projects

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,740
shift from in-person events to online events like this one.

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,000
We did it by creating a guide and sharing it

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,100
broadly with the open source community.

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,950
So these are some things that we have done as Google

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:21,020
to help give back to the industry and to the projects we use and rely on

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,030
but it's really important to point out that we do not do this alone.

00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,860
Sustainability cannot be achieved by just one company

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,350
or just one individual.

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,150
It requires all of us working together

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:38,530
and we are so grateful for all the partners that we work with to contribute back

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:47,450
and make the industry and the projects we use sustainable and future-proofed.

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,820
So these are the things that we do.

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,820
But if you want to get started and contributing to open source

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,100
you can do it today, and you don't need to be part of a big enterprise

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,320
to make a difference.

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,690
Everything counts.

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,650
So here are a few protips that you might want to try right away.

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,220
First is just going to the project you love and use and asking, "How can I help?"

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,659
Trust me, people will point in the right direction.

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,220
But if you don't want to do that

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,980
just go over and start answering issues

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,169
or see if there's any languishing PRs that you can close out.

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:24,660
And you can always fund a project.

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,610
You could buy a membership, you could donate

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,450
you could even buy a T-shirt.

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,409
That kind of money helps too.

00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:36,690
And you can look at our sustainability programs on opensource.google

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,840
and see which ones might help your project and apply for all of them.

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,549
We're happy to share our resources and we really want to.

00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,400
Another protip is to learn more about sustainability

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,330
and you can do so with this great

00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,710
resource that Nadia Eghbal wrote with the Ford Foundation called Roads and Bridges.

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,740
It really explains the basics of sustainability.

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,310
And so I hope you'll check that out.

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,550
I hope that you will start thinking of ways that you can contribute

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,059
because like I said, every little bit matters.

00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:18,529
And this is how we keep open source alive today and into the future.

00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,140
So I want to thank you for your time, and if you have any questions

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,390
