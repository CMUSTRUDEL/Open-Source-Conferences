00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,679
hello everybody and welcome to engaging

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,440
everyone a

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
presentation about virtual event

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
accessibility my name is jules good

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,640
and i'm so excited to be here with you

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,119
today

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,920
so a little bit about me um i am a late

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
deaf person

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
and i have faced a lot of accessibility

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
barriers in life um as i'm

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,880
losing my hearing as i'm getting older

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
and so i'm really passionate about

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
accessibility and helping people

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
um be able to access you know community

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,760
events work events

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,200
social things professional things and so

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
that's why i'm so excited to be here

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
with you today

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,079
to chat with you about how you can make

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,199
your virtual events more accessible

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,960
i'm also the founder and consulting lead

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,760
at an organization called neighborhood

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
access

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
and this is our whole goal is to work

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
with organizations

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
to make sure that their practices are

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
accessible to people with disabilities

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,920
so why should you make your event

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,080
accessible um

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
first off disabled people just like

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
anybody else care about things and want

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
to get involved

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
in their communities and their

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,479
professional networks and all of these

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
networks where virtual events would pop

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,799
up right which is pretty much anywhere

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
but our needs are often overlooked um

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
even though we have a lot of valuable

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
perspectives to share

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
and when our access needs are overlooked

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
that makes it so that

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,360
we aren't able to participate as fully

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,040
in events and that can even discourage

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
people from showing up to events in the

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
first place and that can just be a super

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
frustrating experience

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,920
so you want to make sure that your

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
events are accessible not only to get

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
more people to your event but also to

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,399
make sure that everybody there

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
can participate fully and lastly there

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,399
are more of us than you think

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
the cdc estimates that one in five

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,560
people in the united states

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,640
has some kind of disability while not

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
all of those disabilities

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
necessitate accommodations in the

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,600
virtual world

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,280
a lot of them do um and by holding

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
virtual events you're already needing

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,039
some access needs in the first place for

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
people who aren't able to go out

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,160
um and attend events in person so

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,000
this is really just about optimizing

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,879
your virtual events so that everybody

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,959
can participate

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,800
fully um and have a really great time

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
without all of the frustration and

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
headache of having to

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,680
you know worry about whether things are

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
going to be accessible

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
so something that i really like to do um

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,720
when scheduling events

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,319
is to think about accessibility on a

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,280
timeline so you want to think about the

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,200
things you need to do

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,319
a couple weeks before the event maybe

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
the week of the event

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,879
and then during the event so those are

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,959
kind of the three chunks that we're

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
going to go through together right now

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,480
so at least two weeks from your event

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,519
you're going to want to pick a platform

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
that has a dial-in

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,040
option and what i mean by that is when

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,440
somebody is viewing

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
the uh the link to the event you want to

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,280
make sure that there's an option for

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
them to

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,760
use a phone number that's connected to

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,159
the event invitation

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
to dial in um with a cell phone landline

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,239
whatever

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
the reason we want to do that is because

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
a lot of people

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,519
use relay systems which are essentially

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,560
systems that

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
allow people to dial in

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,239
a captioner or an interpreter to a

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,920
meeting so

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
you should absolutely be scheduling an

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
interpreter and or captioner for your

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,159
meeting but if something happens in a

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
pinch where

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
you know you just have this event

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,200
randomly pop up and there's no time

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
um then you want to make sure you have

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
that dial-in option so that

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,040
folks can utilize those those relay

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
services

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
another really simple thing you can do

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,440
is ask this question on your event

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,599
registration page or on the rsvp

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,519
are there any accessibility tools we can

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,239
provide to ensure you are able to

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
participate fully in this event

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,239
and what that does is it just allows you

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,640
to get a really like general idea

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
of what kind of accommodations people

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
are going to need

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,159
um and that's just really helpful in

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,480
your planning for really large events

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,400
um i would say that you know all of

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
these tools that we're about to go

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
through you should follow

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
um just as the standard because you

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,239
never know who's gonna show up

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
for small events um if you know exactly

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,360
who's gonna be there and exactly what

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,319
their needs are from asking this

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
question

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,680
then you know there might be certain

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,359
things that you can forego if it's just

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
like something really tiny but these are

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,440
all just really good things to keep in

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
mind

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
in general because again you never know

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
if some random person is going to show

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,240
up who has

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,280
an accommodation that you didn't plan

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,040
for and so it's good to just plan for it

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
and be ready to deliver on that

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
accommodation if necessary

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
another thing you need to do a couple

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360
weeks out from your event is schedule an

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,840
interpreter

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,680
and or a captioner so there's kind of a

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
hierarchy of these things that i like to

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,000
think about

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
if you're able to schedule an

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
interpreter and a captioner you

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
absolutely should

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,479
the only thing that really limits

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,479
organizations from doing both is

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,160
budgetary restrictions but if you're

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,000
able to do both you totally should

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
because both are really helpful the

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,639
reason why is because

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,880
um a lot of people think that english

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,919
and asl american sign language are the

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
same language

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
they're not they're really different asl

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
has its own

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,919
grammar its own structure its own syntax

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,479
um and so people who

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
grew up with asl as their primary

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
language

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
might have a harder time reading

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,639
captions at the speed

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,240
that you know speech is being delivered

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
so having an interpreter is really

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,520
helpful to provide

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,479
full access especially to culturally

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
deaf people

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
and then on the flip side of that

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
captions are really helpful for people

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
who don't know sign language

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,720
but are still hard of hearing or might

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
have some other kind of auditory

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
processing disorder

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
and so you really want to have both to

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
cater to the widest range of needs

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
possible

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,960
if you can't i would say second from

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,199
having both would be just having the

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,800
captions because a lot more people can

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
benefit from captions

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
and then for whatever reason if you

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
can't find captions at

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,160
all and you're only able to get an

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
interpreter um then of course that would

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
be

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
kind of at the bottom of the list

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,240
absolutely it's better than nothing

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,160
and will help people you know no matter

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
what so you should definitely do that if

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
that is your only option

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
but if you can do both that would

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,840
definitely be what i would suggest

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,199
moving to one week out from the event so

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,240
this is really all about

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
formatting your materials and preparing

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,319
them

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
so that they are optimized for

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
accessibility so

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,479
the first thing you should do is prepare

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,039
to share your slides or your documents

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,720
or any visual aids with attendees

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,880
in some situations it may not be

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,360
possible to share these prior to the

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
event

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
but if you can you absolutely should the

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,160
reason

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
that this is really helpful is for

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
people who use screen readers

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
so a screen reader is a piece of

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
software

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,120
that blind and low vision people use in

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
order to

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
have text that is on a screen read to

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,479
them out loud

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
so it's like the opposite of speech to

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,319
text that we use on our phones

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,160
it's text to speech and so this is a

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,440
really important tool for people to give

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
them access to

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
um to any text or anything that you

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,960
would read

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,199
on a screen and so the issue with having

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,639
slides or documents um you know with

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,960
your screen sharing them on a

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,960
teleconferencing platform

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
is that the screen reader doesn't

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,880
recognize

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,599
um what's on the video as being text it

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
just says oh

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,639
you know that's a video i don't have to

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
read anything to whoever's using me

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,639
because there's no text here

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,000
so when you are able to share slides and

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,680
documents ahead of time

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,039
then people can use their screen readers

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
they'll know what to prepare for it

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
they'll have full access to the

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
materials

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
they won't have to play catch up after

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
the fact um so it's great to just be

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,440
proactive with

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
accessibility in that regard another

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
thing that's important when you're

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
formatting your visual materials is to

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
add alt text which is sometimes also

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
called

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
image descriptions so this is also a

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
screen reader related

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,400
accommodation so when a screen reader

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,639
comes across a picture

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,919
on your screen unless there's alt text

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
it just says oh there's a picture i

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,360
don't have to do anything with that

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
um and then the person using the screen

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,000
reader doesn't have access to whatever

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
is in that image

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,400
so when we add alt text um it basically

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,919
sends a message to the screen reader

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,639
that says hey this is what's in this

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,639
picture

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,560
so let's do an alt text practice with

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,560
this picture of me and my dog here

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,560
so if i were to add alt text to this

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,400
image i would say

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,000
this is a picture of a small black

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,360
chihuahua curled up on a person's lap

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,639
and they are maybe sleeping um so super

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
simple you're just giving

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,240
an idea of what's going on in the image

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,080
um doesn't have to be

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,839
super super detailed notice i didn't

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
talk about you know the pattern on my

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,159
shirt or what's going on

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,159
in the background um it's just uh an

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,440
idea of whatever the most important

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,560
um content of that image is

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
the next thing you're going to want to

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,760
do is format your materials

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,440
with headings and proper fonts um so

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,440
obviously this is for materials that

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,399
have text associated with them

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,680
um so if you have long documents you

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,080
want to make sure that those have

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,000
headings and not just headings that you

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
make by hitting you know control b

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
and making something bold or italicized

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
or whatever but

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
headings that are selected from your

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
word processors

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
settings to say like oh yeah this is

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
heading one this is heading two

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,839
um this is normal text this is a

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,399
subheading yada yada yada

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,839
and that is helpful for screen readers

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,600
in terms of

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,120
understanding the organization of the

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
page so that it can

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
read to the person using the screen

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
reader um you know

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,399
a lot more coherently and not have it

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,440
just be like a random

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
stream of words and with fonts what we

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,360
want to consider

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,680
is serif versus sans serif fonts so

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,480
serif fonts are fonts like times new

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,920
roman

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,160
um or gothic um that have you know those

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,600
little lines kind of at the edge of each

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,839
part of the letter

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
and sans serif fonts would be fonts like

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
the ones on this slide

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,480
that don't have any of those little

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
lines so it's just like the simplest

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,600
kind of smoothest form that the letter

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,959
can be in

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
and the reason it's important to use

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,120
sans serif fonts is because the seraph

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
can make it more difficult for

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,240
people um particularly people with

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,279
visual

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
processing disorders like dyslexia to

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
discern between letters um it makes it

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,320
easier for things to kind of get jumbled

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
together when we have all those extra

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
lines so

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,519
the cleanest most sans-serify font that

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
you can find is going to be the best way

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,839
to go

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
another thing that you should do is

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,959
provide the interpreter with a list of

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
key terms

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,760
i know with all of our tech meetings and

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,200
you know our industry specific terms

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,040
there's a lot of jargon in there that

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,880
sometimes we don't even think about

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,279
um and you want to make sure that any of

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
those acronyms those proper nouns

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,399
names you know any really technical

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
language

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
you are um giving the interpreter a

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
heads up of

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
the kind of language that you're going

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
to be using so just like a list of those

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,160
words super easy

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,360
and that way um they're able to prepare

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
for that ahead of time

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,640
um you know practice fingerspelling um

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
any

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,800
any words that are like super long or

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,200
complicated or maybe finding the signs

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
um

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,680
for words that aren't as commonly used

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,040
so that is just going to be super

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
helpful for your interpreter in the

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
meeting

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
and lastly as you're setting the agenda

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,279
for your meeting you're going to make

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
sure that your scheduling breaks

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
into the event so i like to follow the

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,079
rule which means that for every 30

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,480
minutes of

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,839
you know lecture style presentation like

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,959
right now where i'm like just kind of

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,519
talking at you

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
um that you provide a five-minute break

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,079
after each of those 30 minute segments

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
and you know it's not always possible to

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,760
follow this and i understand that

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
different um schedules and different

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,839
agendas um call for different things

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,360
but just try to scatter a couple short

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
breaks throughout your event

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
this is not only good for people who

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,600
might struggle with

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,720
attention um you know people like me

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,399
with add

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
um who just have a really hard time

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,279
sitting still

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,720
but also for folks who um have maybe

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
medical needs that come up throughout

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
the day or

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
um bathroom related needs where you know

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
they're just gonna need a little bit of

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,160
time to just

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
do that self-care make sure that they've

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
got you know all their medication

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,200
and all of that stuff figured out um so

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
that they are

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,760
at the top of their game for the

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,680
duration of your event

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,120
and lastly we have the things you should

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
do during your event

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
so the first of these would be audio

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
cues and these kind of come into two

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,440
forms

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,480
the first would be um your initial

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,399
introductions

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,160
and the second is throughout the event

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,120
so in the initial introductions you just

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
want to give a quick

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
visual description of yourself um and

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
what this does

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
is it helps people who are blind or low

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,639
vision um just kind of

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
have some you know verbal thing to

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,200
remember you by other than the sound of

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,360
your voice

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,880
so when i say like oh hey you know it's

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
jules talking they can be like oh yeah

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
that's the person who said they were

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
wearing a yellow blazer like i

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,399
i kind of remember um you know how to

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,880
distinguish them from somebody else

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,079
and so the initial introduction you just

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,760
want to say like

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
this is how i would do mine if i was in

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,040
a meeting right now hi

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,600
i'm jules i have brown hair i'm white

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,800
and i am wearing a yellow blazer with a

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,720
green shirt underneath

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,399
and some rainbow colored earrings you

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,519
know any of what you want to say in that

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,040
visual description is

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
optional and up to you but if you can

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,920
just give you know a quick overview of

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,680
what you look like

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,360
any kind of key accessories or whatever

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
you're wearing that is really helpful

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
for folks

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
and then the other type of audio cue is

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,920
what you do during the event

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,680
so this is not only helpful to uh blind

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,760
and low vision folks because

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,040
um you know keeping track of everybody's

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
the sound of everybody's voice

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
especially if you've just met them is

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,839
really difficult

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,519
um so when you're switching between

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,279
speakers just make sure that you

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
reintroduce yourself real quick

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
um when it's your turn to speak again so

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
it's helpful in that regard and then

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,760
it's also helpful for folks who are

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
using interpreters because then the

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,040
interpreter can say

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
oh yeah that's jules talking or oh yeah

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,199
that's dan talking or whoever

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,399
um so that the person who's you know

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,920
relying on the interpreter for

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
communication

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,360
can also have an easier time keeping

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,519
track of you speaking at what time

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,040
another thing that's really important um

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,720
is content warnings

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,760
so these are especially um important

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,519
because there are certain um visuals or

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,480
sounds that can trigger people to have

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,560
different reactions

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
um you know even as serious as

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,680
triggering a seizure

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,920
or a panic attack or something that is

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,519
just really not going to be a fun time

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,279
when you're on screen with a bunch of

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,880
different people so um

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,320
there are kind of three things that you

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
definitely want to make sure you include

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,199
content warnings for it

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,279
if you have any visuals that have

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,040
flashing lights you know like a really

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
commonly known one is strobes but just

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,160
kind of flashing lights in general

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,040
any rapidly transitioning graphics so if

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
you're like going through a you know

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
slideshow of photos

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
like a million miles an hour or

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,680
something you want to make sure you

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
put a content warning for that and then

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,760
also any

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,639
sudden um and especially sudden loud

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
noises

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,399
um those can be really bothersome for

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
folks so just a couple of minutes before

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
those things happen

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
or even you know give people a 10 second

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
countdown before those things happen

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
is really just going to help to keep the

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,800
participants of your meeting safe

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,639
um and while we often don't think about

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,519
safety in terms of

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,800
you know maybe virtual events um this is

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,920
definitely an area where

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,519
safety is really important another thing

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
you should do is to prepare for

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,399
interpreter questions

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,519
so um you know sometimes your internet

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,760
might cut out

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
or um there's some background noise

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,079
that's like making it hard to understand

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
what you're saying

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
the interpreter is going to cut in and

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
say hey i didn't understand what you

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
said can you repeat that

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,040
and that's because they want to make

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
sure that you know the person who's

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
relying on the interpreter for

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,920
communication

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
has full access to the information

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,959
that's being relayed

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
just prepare for those questions related

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,920
to clarification because that's really

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,920
going to be helpful for the folks who

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,360
are relying on the interpreters

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,920
and lastly we want to make sure that

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,759
we're describing visual elements

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,199
verbally so let's do an example of that

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,079
together right now

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,120
so if i was going to describe this graph

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,040
in a way

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
that a blind or low vision person could

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
understand it

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,160
i would say this is a pie chart that

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,120
shows the number

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,880
of points that each team scores team one

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,519
scored 21.8 percent

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,920
team two scored 32.7 percent of points

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,320
team three scored 10.9 percent of points

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,040
and team four scored 34.5 percent of

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,440
points

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,199
so now you've just you know described

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,199
basically what's going on in this chart

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,199
now there are situations where if you

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,759
have a gazillion data points it's not

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
going to be

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,320
effective um or you know

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,360
time effective to to describe each point

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,920
like i just did

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,759
so you can say um just kind of the

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,320
general trend of the graph so

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,000
if this pie chart for example had like a

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,040
lot more data points but

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,839
um team four had still scored the

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,360
the biggest amount of points i would say

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,040
here's a pie chart there's a lot of

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,839
information here but we can see that

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
team four

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
scored the most amount of points and

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
team three scored the least amount of

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
points so you just kind of want to

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,600
identify the pieces of information that

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
are important

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
and then make sure that you're

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,319
communicating those verbally and not

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
just pointing them out visually

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,760
and that will make sure that everybody

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
has full access to

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
you know the information that you're

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
trying to describe

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
and that brings us to the end of the

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
presentation

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,360
um i just want to remind you you know

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
hopefully as

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,640
um covid dies down and we're able to

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,120
start having in-person events again

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
um that you should continue to have a

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,120
virtual event option

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,640
um when you have in-person events um

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,000
like i was saying earlier there's a lot

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,799
of folks who aren't going to be able to

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
make it

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,720
out to in-person events for a variety of

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,360
reasons so having that virtual option

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,000
will really

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
improve engagement with your event um

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
and

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,240
you know i hope that when you do

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,000
continue having virtual events that you

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,960
will use these tips and tricks

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,720
um and that you will be able to

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,600
facilitate an event that

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,400
really is engaging and meaningful um and

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,720
inclusive

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:09,289
of everyone thank you so much

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,289
