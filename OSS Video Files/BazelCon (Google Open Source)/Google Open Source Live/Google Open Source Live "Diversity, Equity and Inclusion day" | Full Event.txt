session from ondo who's going to be

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,759
exploring the butterfly effect for open

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
source diversity equity and

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,360
inclusion through her experience in

enjoy and welcome to the event

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,239
hi i'm carmen ando with google

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
i'd like to talk about the get

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,479
contributor inclusion summit

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
a butterfly effect for open source

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,240
diversity

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,759
equity and inclusion in 2020 amidst a

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
global pandemic

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
that shown a spotlight on structural

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,960
inequities

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,479
a black man named george floyd was

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
killed by a police officer in

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,199
minneapolis

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,440
not brutally or violently but by

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
eight minutes of callous indifference to

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
a black man's life

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
at the hands of a person who was

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,680
supposed to serve and protect

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
the fallout was far and wide communities

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
all over the world

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,880
exploded into protest in offices

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,639
and homes it sparked conversations about

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,320
race and justice

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
conversations that have been happening

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,680
in black communities for decades

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
these made their way into the national

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,520
dialogue over 50 years ago in the first

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,639
civil rights movement of the 1960s and

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
were taken up anew

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
six years ago with the start of black

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,639
lives matter

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,919
culminating in 2020 as a global racial

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,680
reckoning

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,639
one that had garnered mainstream

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,199
worldwide attention

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,880
these images were taken in nairobi paris

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
and cologne germany

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,639
the collage on the lower right honors

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
the many black lives

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
taken at the hands of police or the

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
justice system

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
over many years you may find yourself

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
asking

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,080
what does this have to do with open

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
source software development

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,840
with this reckoning in order to

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,639
understand and make sense of these

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,199
events

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,639
many of us in tech and an open source

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,039
looked inward

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,000
to see how to affect change in areas of

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,120
our lives

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,160
that we had influence over this story is

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,479
an example

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
of how one small group looked to be the

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,960
change they wish

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,120
to see in the world this talk

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,800
is for anyone who wants to make open

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,280
source a place that is more inclusive

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,120
representational and equitable for all

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,560
this includes developers maintainers

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,440
organizers of events or any open source

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
enthusiast

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,360
that wants to know where they can start

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880
this talk comes in four parts and my

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,560
goal is to take the diff

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,280
of where we are and where we need to be

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
with a road map of how to get there this

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,800
includes

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,319
contemplation preparation action and

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,520
maintenance

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,280
as the descriptions allude these four

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,960
parts take a journey from a

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,840
moral philosophical societal reflective

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,240
journey

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
into the operational nitty gritty

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
details

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,960
because both the vision and the

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,800
execution details are needed for change

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,319
in this way i hope that everyone

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,440
understands how

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,080
these approaches complement each other

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,759
to contemplate is to think profoundly

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,960
and at length

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,479
in this context we ask ourselves what is

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,440
open source

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,000
how do open source projects reflect a

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,560
larger

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,919
global society and where can they

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,120
improve

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:33,120
open source is not just code it's

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,440
made by and for people open source is

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
fundamentally a vision for how humans

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
can work together

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,599
to create works of greater good for

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,879
developers and maintainers

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,560
that meant looking within projects both

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,280
code and products processes tooling

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,440
and the way project members collaborate

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,560
and produce the code

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,440
open source is people

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,919
but although open source is people it's

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,800
not

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,479
everybody this is from the most recent

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,520
stack overflow global

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,639
developer survey we see 7 out of every

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,319
10 developers

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,240
are white this is the survey by gender

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
which represents an even wider

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,960
discrepancy

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,680
nine out of ten developers are men

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,560
the 2020 racial reckoning needed to

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,639
become

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,680
and became a larger reckoning on dei

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,000
diversity equity and inclusion from a

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
logical standpoint the representation

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
found in open source projects

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
should closely resemble the demographics

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
of the world

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,360
yet it does not it is still widely

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,600
over-represented by men of white or

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,800
european descent

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
understanding the reasons behind this

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,080
over-representation

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
why and how it happens is the key to

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,880
fixing it

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
i like this quote by craig owens

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,080
representation then is not

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,959
nor can it be neutral it is an act

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
indeed the founding act of power in our

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,240
culture

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,920
and this is where we come to talk about

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
one set of maintainers

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,040
in one open source project who came

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,200
together to improve their dei

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,560
that project is the get source control

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,720
management tool

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,640
in order to give a bit of context i'm

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
going to take a step back to describe

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
git

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
and its impact on the software

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,320
development industry

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,200
i'd like to describe the relationship

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,279
between git and git hosting sites

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
git is the source control tooling that

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,600
you install locally on your computer

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,399
to work with burgeoning and changing

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
code in a distributed manner

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,600
sites like bitbucket github and gitlab

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,399
are code hosting sites that also add

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
workflows

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,480
and other features to work with git with

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,200
the rise and popularity of github

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
followed by git lab git has grown to

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,440
become the defacto tool

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
of source cord management in the last

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
five years

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,120
it became so standard that the developer

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,519
surveys no longer ask

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,560
which source control tool is used

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,839
because it's mostly assumed to beget

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,519
why is this relevant well this makes git

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,000
the foundational tool for

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,560
90 plus of the world software developers

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,120
this is an extraordinary in terms of

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
mind

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,480
or market share when it comes to

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,279
technology choice in the stack

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,640
for developers globally in terms of

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,600
influence

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,399
90 plus percent of the world's estimated

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,279
26 million developers use get

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,399
and git is developed by a core group of

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,760
less than 100

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,800
people for shaping developer culture

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
thinking attitudes and more this group

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,120
of contributors

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,040
has enormous influence

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
git is a member of the software freedom

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,000
conservancy which accepts

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,160
donations on git's behalf but a larger

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,079
donation is found in companies paying

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,079
their employees to work full-time

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,560
devoted to improving git

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,640
these companies include google home to

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,279
the primary maintainer of get

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,399
junior homano as well as the git core

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,360
team

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,920
employees of github gitlab microsoft and

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
more

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,120
also work on git full time but

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
in terms of representation the core

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,680
contributors to git were not represented

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
of the wider world at large

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,200
similar to the results of the developer

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
demographic surveys

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
this small group has almost no racial

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,360
ethnic

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,200
or gender diversity so the first step in

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,120
contemplating

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,480
this meant that order forget to be more

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,600
diverse equitable

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
and inclusive they need to look at the

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
group that

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,800
provides this code but also the code and

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,440
the tool itself

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,600
for tooling one simple but powerful

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,880
change that could be made straight away

00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,639
was terminology in summer of 2020

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,639
a move was made to change several terms

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,480
the most notable being the default

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,560
branch changed to be called

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,200
main github and gitlab made these

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,560
changes

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
in the fall of 2020 and this is part of

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
a broader effort in open source

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,079
to contemplate certain terms as being

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
negative

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,880
or reinforcing negative associations and

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,760
unconscious bias

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,880
google open source blogged about their

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,360
initiative to have

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,240
all of google's projects that are an

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
open source

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,480
numbering in the thousands change their

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
technical terminology

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
to omit certain phrases

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,360
if you work in open source and haven't

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,720
taken an audit of the terminology used

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
in your project

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
even if it is terminology inherited in

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
your project

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,040
dependencies or upstream this is a great

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,680
first step in making your code and

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,079
project

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,120
more inclusive we come to the second

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,560
part

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,480
preparation maintainers of get core

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
recognized that they needed to do

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,680
something beyond terminology

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,079
that terminology was not enough

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,519
looking inward at the lack of diversity

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,320
in the project's contributors

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,240
i just mentioned and also understanding

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,120
negative associations and unconscious

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,440
bias

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
they decided to look at wider patterns

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,040
of bias

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,920
they also wanted to bring along everyone

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,320
who played a part in making the get tool

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
as you see here in this screenshot one

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
maintainer does just this

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,720
in june of 2020. git does their

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,040
discussion on the mailing list

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,000
a plain text email list that can be read

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,199
publicly at lore.kernel.org

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,680
get here you see a maintainer

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,760
making the suggestion about organizing a

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,880
virtual contributor summit focused

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,800
solely on the ei she also recognized the

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
lack of diversity in the group which

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,519
creates prospective

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,040
gaps to improving that said dei

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,000
given that we know this group has an

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,959
enormous influence on a key foundational

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,720
developer tool git knew that in order to

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,199
succeed in a larger way

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,480
it needed to start with the contributors

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,320
as a first stage

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,519
they invited contributors to a virtual

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,600
summit that

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
instead of talking about a wide array of

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,199
subjects they would focus so

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,360
solely on diversity equity and inclusion

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,760
since that group in it themselves needed

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
more representation beyond

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,600
they organized where they brainstormed

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
on ways to get that broader perspective

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
to

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
make change the group would hire an

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,800
endless help from

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,560
outside experts focus the event on level

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
setting and education

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,839
and manage expectations by coming up

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
with pre-reading

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
material to make sure that attendees did

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,160
some work

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,240
and had a certain level of understanding

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,560
prior to attending

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,079
as the event planning started to happen

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
more

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,720
extra people expressed interest in

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,360
helping and this became a collaboration

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,519
between google software engineers

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,079
technical programming managers

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,839
the open source programming office the

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,560
diversity business partners within

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,560
google

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,040
as well as microsoft open source

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,519
programs office joining

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,199
and as we move from planning to action

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,600
this part three moves from

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,079
the philosophical and moral imperatives

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
to those practicalities of running such

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
an event

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
depending on the goals you set in the

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,920
contemplation stage

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,880
and the plans you made in the

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,440
preparation stage this action stage can

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
occur

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
in different steps they could be all in

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
one

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,560
or small gradual steps

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,800
a couple of practical tips to let you

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,440
know how to put an event together

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,079
and what details not to leave out the

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
first

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,959
is to ensure high trust you should

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
always take time to establish ground

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
rules

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,360
i'd argue that for every productive

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,360
event you need ground rules

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,959
running an event like this doesn't need

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
a lot of tech

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,240
we kept it simple it's appropriate to

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,240
keep

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,320
the tooling that the project already

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,880
uses in this case

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
the git project to use the plain text

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,959
email

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
for the mailing list we also want to

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,720
make sure that we give

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,759
extra care and thought to accessibility

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,519
access

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,000
to in git's case they wanted to continue

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,000
to use

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
that mailing list for discussion and

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,279
consensus building

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,440
since many of the attendees were

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,959
googlers as well as organizers

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,759
we use g suite tools like docs sheets

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
forms and even google draw for planning

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,120
and

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,360
executing the event lastly we use a

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,399
self-hosted

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,199
jitsie for video conferencing

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
at the behest of the attendees who

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,480
wanted an

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,240
open source video conferencing solution

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
in fact at the beginning of planning we

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,920
sent out a survey

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,199
asking for people or if people had any

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,040
strong objections

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,680
to any kind of tooling that we should

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,079
use i mentioned this because

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
how you engage your stakeholders and how

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,400
you build consensus

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
is as important as what is stated in the

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,160
event itself

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,679
for all but the biggest open source

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,000
projects

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
you're going to have a small scale with

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
contributors

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,000
most open source core teams make up only

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
a few people

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,120
work with those contributors that have

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,480
been involved with the project

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,679
for a long time this may not work for

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
every project

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,000
you need to think carefully on event

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,840
goals part of the get project's goals

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,080
was to bring together the people who had

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,679
been with the project for a long time

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,600
but also try to bring in the right

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,320
amount of new perspective to enlighten

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,360
the group

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,919
while keeping the trust high

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
you also recognize that many open source

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
projects work

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,120
asynchronously over many time zones

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,760
so this event ended up being

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,640
two half days or four and a half hour

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,559
slots

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,400
that tried to compromise on 15 different

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,200
time zones

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,600
communicating that compromise and making

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,960
that compromise easier to do

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000
for example four hours only in the early

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,240
hours of the morning for

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,919
australia instead of a full eight hours

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,080
in the middle of the night

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,480
will go a long way in ensuring the

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,600
success of your event

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,559
here are some how-to's and screen shots

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,880
of artifacts of the event the left is an

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,440
event brief with the event purpose

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
objective and measurable measurable

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
goals to be able to

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,440
understand what what it is and why

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,720
you're doing it so the why

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,240
followed by tactical strategy think

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,039
who what or how you can also keep an

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
appendix of

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,360
any communication that you had in our

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,000
case the mailing list

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,000
and it would serve as a useful reference

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,440
document or what we call a home-based

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
document to come back to

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,600
over and over again the second document

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
is a google form to sign up registrants

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,120
you can use other tools that you're

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,520
familiar and comfortable with

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,760
but more importantly make sure that you

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
understand the tools

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,600
that your attendees are most comfortable

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,640
with

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,720
here's the agenda which included

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
after much consensus building and

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,559
stakeholder engagement

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,520
training and level setting on half day

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,919
one

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
followed by unconference discussion

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,440
breakout sessions

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
which means that they're essentially

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,320
chosen and voted on

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,799
by attendees on half day two

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,880
again we did have to corral time zones

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,200
and availability of all the contributors

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,799
across all the time zones and we did

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,960
that using the browser-based

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:51,520
when is good.net tool one other bits not

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
shown here is moderator moderator

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
training

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,559
for discussion leaders about a group of

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,200
half dozen who volunteered to

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,360
take the lead in these discussions they

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,080
all attended a brief one-hour workshop

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,039
on how best to facilitate conversations

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,559
approximately

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,679
one week before the summit for day of

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,159
details

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
um we made a google spreadsheet that

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,240
used

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,400
and used that as the place to suggest uh

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
the discussion breakout topics

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
and also to have the attendees vote or

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
rate those topics

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,960
and put the highest rated discussions

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,280
into the time slots on half day two

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,240
the voting mechanism was simple we

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,400
simply asked

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,000
the voters to add an asterisk or

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,080
increment it by one in the

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,679
second column again look for the easiest

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,799
tool to get the job done

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,400
for the scale that you need finally all

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,720
the documents were made available to

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,640
participants on the site here

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,960
as well as other information for public

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,520
consumption you can use a lot of this

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,039
for

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,080
ideas for your event lastly

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,039
in action there were many takeaways from

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,000
the summit

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,919
a few listed and grouped here they

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
include the terminology

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,360
changes that were discussed earlier

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,159
including

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,000
uh dead naming or name mapping without

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
making dead names more prominent

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
a real challenge for version source

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,960
control tool

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,840
representation sponsorship and mentoring

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
for people

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,520
that need to have better representation

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,039
the mailing list or inclusive project

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,480
communication

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,360
accessibility and localization

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,039
code review including bias and ways to

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,039
make sure that you keep it friendly and

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,159
welcoming in an asynchronous

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,799
mode attracting beginner-friendly

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,600
non-user and non-code contributions to

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,400
the project

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,559
including value in them user and

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,840
contributor documentation

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,799
and user experience research since the

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,480
time of recording

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,320
there is a name mapping that takes dead

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,480
naming into

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,600
account and it handles it much better

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,880
than the previous

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,960
versions of git the other thing i should

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,880
say as i wrap up the actions is that

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,320
many of these takeaways are universal

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,640
among projects

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,520
and what to do with them and when is the

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
key for

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,240
maintaining as we mentioned maintaining

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,960
notes of the summit are linked here and

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,919
you can read

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,840
the full list of projects and all the

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,880
things that were discussed

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,120
plans for 2021 forget are include

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
additional follow-up summits or summit

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,120
for contributors

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,440
and a possible larger event with gets

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,679
end users

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,799
i want to come to you with two

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,320
conclusions

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:46,159
about planning preparing and acting

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,120
on this event the first is

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,520
one of my favorite quotes about my job

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,840
software is never done

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,720
this describes the cyclical nature of

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,640
development

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
whether it's going to be software

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,200
development or other types of

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
development

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,840
and so diversity equity and inclusion

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,919
by their nature is and always will be

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,320
a work unfinished where a cycle of

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,799
re-contemplation

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,520
more preparation additional and new

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,679
action

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
and ongoing maintenance will always be

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,919
needed

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,559
lastly my talk subheading was titled

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,840
contributor inclusion summit a butterfly

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,120
effect for open source

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,159
diversity equity and inclusion

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,000
a butterfly effect is a phenomenon where

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,400
one small act can result in

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,679
large differences later on when i think

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,880
of the butterfly effect

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,960
i think of this quote by margaret mead

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,400
never underestimate the power of a small

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
group of committed people

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,360
to change the world in fact it is the

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,080
only thing that ever has

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,679
for open source developers maintainers

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,080
and project contributors

00:23:51,679 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you for changing the world one

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:05,840
merge at a time

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,919
wow thank you carmen for making such a

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,000
powerful connection between how humans

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,799
work together on open source software

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,080
and the topic of dei i especially

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,720
appreciate the reminder that both

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
software

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,679
and dei work are never done so let's

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,039
head into a live poll

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,400
don't forget to submit your answer on

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,840
the event page otherwise you won't be

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,520
able to see the result

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,279
this question asks have you ever

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,080
attended any inclusion summits

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,840
in the last year sophia i'll post the

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,320
question to you

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,919
well so i haven't attended any any

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,039
events that are specifically designed

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,080
around inclusion

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,200
um but my immediate team has been having

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,679
a monthly

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,320
dei discussion group uh where we meet

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,480
and discuss

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,480
various topics um and it's been a

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,279
wonderful way to continue the

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,200
conversation to learn from my colleagues

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,799
and to learn other perspectives in a

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,279
very frank candid

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,200
and controlled format so i feel like

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,880
i've participated in many little events

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
and discussion groups on this topic but

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,960
but no big events

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,039
that's so great it's always good to have

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,559
the conversation in whatever setting

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,440
thank you all for participating in the

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,240
poll next we'll hear a fireside chat

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,400
from carolyn cinders and maria cruz

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,279
about online harassment and workplace

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:11,840
toxicity

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:11,840
take it away

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,799
hi everybody welcome to this fireside

program office

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,880
and i have here with me caroline cinders

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,279

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
caroline and i met while working at the

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,279
wikimedia foundation

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,679
and she is here today to talk about

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
remote workplace statisticity and online

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,720

caroline sanders i run

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,279
convocation design and research a

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,960
consulting firm where we use

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,799
design and r d to analyze complex

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,840
problems on different kinds of platforms

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,640
and looking at how

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,320
technology affects society so recently

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,640
i've been working on a report with

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,600
mckinsey mac group and project include

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,520
with ellen powell

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,000
on remote workplace toxicity and

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,960
harassment with a specific focus on

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,600
covid19

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,679
since the coven 19 stay-at-home orders

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
across the globe have forced workplaces

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,039
to go from being

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,159
in person to being totally remote and

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,919
within this we saw

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,480
a lot of problems start to arise and we

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,440
wanted to create a report to try to

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,480
address

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,080
different issues we were seeing

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,440
great uh thank you for for being here

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,880
um i uh

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,720
i was reflecting on the fact that

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,840
looking at your work uh

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,880
how you um you

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,760
look into words that are used in online

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,120
conversations

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,320
from a quantitative er perspective

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,880
um i was wondering if you could uh

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,279
reflect a little bit more uh on the

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,520
choice of words that we use

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:24,399
when talking to each other online um

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
what what is the the weight that words

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,919
have

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,679
in conversation why why is it so

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,080
taxing for us when somebody says

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,399
something mean to us

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,279
for sure thank you for that i tend to

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,799
look at um

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,120
actions words events and the

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,640
the design affordances of systems around

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,559
us so how

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,240
how a person builds a mental model of

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,200
the technology around them that they

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,159
exist in

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,640
uh generally i'm i look at people inside

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,559
of

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,880
networks and platforms so when i'm

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,640
studying a problem i'm looking at how

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,080
how someone may be facing harassment

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,279
inside of something like facebook

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,480
or how someone can face harm

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,039
using github right so just what what the

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,000
design

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,399
of that platform is and then what are

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
the tools someone has at hand

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,919
to mitigate that harm and then i'm

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,520
looking at the different kinds and

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,760
levels of harm within that so

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,559
the words people use and sometimes the

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,440
words people

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,000
don't use um so it's a very

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,120
multi-pronged problem

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
one thing that's important to keep in

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,799
mind and i'm sure i don't have to

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,240
spend a lot of time arguing this i'm

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
sure this audience would agree with me

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,960
that

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
you know our online lives are as real as

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,240
our offline lives so something that

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,559
someone says to you online

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,559
is as hurtful as something someone says

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,640
to you offline like if you were

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
to tell me over video chat that you

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,080
didn't like my lipstick color like that

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,159
wouldn't feel good because i

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,679
thought we were friends right but also

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,360
that would be a very rude thing to say

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,240
to the invited speaker

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,120
and so while that could be an innocuous

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,360
statement

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,440
how how you would articulate that to me

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
it would still be somewhat hurtful right

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,720
and so what i think is important is to

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,720
look at the different kinds of words and

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,399
languages people use in response to

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,840
harassment so

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,840
we can have more direct forms of

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,360
harassment like a direct

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,919
threat um curse words words that are

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,200
generally agreed to be harmful right and

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,200
so that can be

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,039
describing different kinds of abuse or

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,679
like leveling abuse at someone

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,279
again things like curse words or talking

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,679
about physical harm

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,440
but there are also forms of language and

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,200
actions that may seem more innocuous

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,880
that are in fact quite toxic

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,559
so this is where we are looking at

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,600
things like microaggressions

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,320
so someone saying to you you speak so

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,080
well

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
and saying that in a surprise way or

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
just generally saying that

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,240
is a form of a microaggression that is

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,840
toxic it just may not initially read

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,200
someone as toxic so it's not necessarily

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,480
innocuous right so

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,919
that phrase you speak so well like

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,919
you pause speak uh so

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,960
well all those as different words may

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,679
not seem

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,519
toxic or as toxic as a swear word but

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,480
when strung together it has a sort of

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,799
cultural

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,399
and biased weight behind it that is then

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,399
harmful to the recipient

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,799
so i look at things like this like what

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,480
are the norms of a group

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,960
inside of a space and then what are

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,480
varying levels of veiled harm that are

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,559
then leveled at people

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,200
and how do we sort of elevate that and

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,399
talk about that i'm extremely interested

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,559
in uh toxicity and

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,080
what um i think what like more

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,440
privileged groups could think of as like

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,440
innocuous harm that are

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,159
is probably as best described as like

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,840
microaggressions

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,880
um i think you're touching on a a very

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,679
interesting uh topic here

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
which is what are the different ways in

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,279
which

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,039
we can enter conflict in a in a

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,120
conversation i i remember

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,080
a presentation you gave at wikimedia

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,360
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,880
where um you started the conversation

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,840
by stating that uh an important

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,399
distinction

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,360
that between conflict harassment and

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,320
abuse

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,679
um i was wondering if you could speak a

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,799
little bit about that difference

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,960
for sure so um i think there are varying

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,320
levels of interactions and frictions

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,600
people can encounter

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,640
so conflict is really natural one thing

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,640
i like to say is

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,399
community doesn't mean friendship just

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,480
because we're in a community together

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,000
that doesn't mean that i need to like

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,399
you or vice versa

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,840
but that doesn't give you carte blanche

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,039
to

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,440
uh be mean to me or be mean to someone

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,159
else

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,440
so communities will naturally have

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,519
friction within them

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,320
people will not get along and that is

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,720
just that's actually pretty natural

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,720
it's how you manifest that friction and

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,000
how you respond to someone

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,799
that's actually where harassment and

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,799
abuse can

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,159
can lie so one thing that's important to

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,519
think about i think

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,840
is intent versus impact so

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,720
someone may say something and not

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,519
understand

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,880
uh the impact of their words perhaps

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,240
there's a cultural difference perhaps

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,600
there's a generational difference

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,440
perhaps they just

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,440
said something off the cuff and didn't

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,640
really think about it

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,880
and their intent is not to harm but the

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,559
impact of their actions actually causes

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,279
harm and i think it's important to look

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,039
at the impact really rather versus the

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,399
intent

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,080
this is where i really advise

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,799
communities to create

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,679
a ladder of consequences so being able

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,000
to say

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,360
this kind of action is going to have

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,440
this kind of response from us

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,200
as the organizers and this is how it

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,760
matches up to our terms of service

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,600
community guidelines code of conduct

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,919
employee handbook etc so if someone does

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,880
accidentally say something and it's

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,880
considered

00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,640
a lower form of harassment or abuse

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,240
we can handle it more as just general

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,960
conflict where

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,320
an intermediary can step in explain why

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,480
that was harmful

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,079
give an action so that could be a

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,359
punitive response that could be

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,560
education that could

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,720
you know say you have to issue an

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,119
apology and

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,240
then sort of like move on right and so

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,000
when you have this ladder of

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,000
consequences you can start to look at

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,760
actions and say like well actually what

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,280
is the severity of them and where do

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,359
they fall within this

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,119
and map out responses you can have a

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,079
sort of a structured response and it can

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,359
be agreed upon

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,280
response so you know if someone engages

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,280
in let's say physical violence

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,800
the ladder of consequences may say

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
actually all physical violence

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,960
is results in an immediate dismissal

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
from our community and we've all agreed

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
upon that because it's in our code of

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,639
conduct

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,960
and we've mapped it in our ladder of

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,359
consequences maybe on the top step

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,480
which is where like you know immediate

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,159
dismissal is

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,560
so it's really important to be able to

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,280
understand that not all

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,320
like not all actions are necessarily

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,599
abusive

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,040
so lower forms of abuse which we could

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,200
put into the conflict area

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,320
if they continue especially after

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,920
someone has said

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,000
um i'm uncomfortable please don't do

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,400
that those lower forms

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,160
stack up and can create a very toxic and

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,119
then very harmful and very abusive

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,839
environment

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,440
so also like the repeated engagement of

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,680
bad actions

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,920
um you know can all like needs to be

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,839
mapped out and analyzed as well

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,240
and in that and in my presentation at

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,359
wikimedia in 2017 that was something i

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,640
was really interested in

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,760
is how do we look at repeating lower

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,560
forms of

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,839
toxicity especially within the wikimedia

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,240
universe so

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,040
you know if someone is constantly

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,400
correcting you

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,160
or undoing your edits that at first

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,760
can look like conflict but if it's you

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,200
know if it continues and continues and

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,320
continues and you've asked this person

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,240
to stop

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,040
you know your edits have no reason to be

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,920
like undone or re-edited in any way that

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,760
is a form

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,359
of harassment because you've you've

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,200
asked someone to stop and they are not

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,599
listening to you setting a boundary and

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,200
they're

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,480
actually invading your boundary i i see

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,000
clearly the the role of people

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,359
um and moderators in in these

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,640
processes that you describe uh i i was

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,599
wondering

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,320
uh what role can technology and

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,040
specifically

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,920
machine learning play in uh

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,400
holding or supporting a code of conduct

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,480
for

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
a project for for an open source project

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,599
for example or for

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,440
any online community a

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,520
what how far can we can we go with using

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,200
this technology to support these

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,359
uh these processes i don't really know

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,440
how like what the role should be of

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,920
technology within this or rather

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,079
i do know and my advice is often like

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,560
not a big role because

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,320
i think to solve human problems you need

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,839
human responses so in the case of

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
moderation

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,359
you can use machine learning to try to

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,640
build a classifier on on abusive

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,240
language and what you're really building

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,680
is a keyword filter i think

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,520
at that point because a lot of

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,400
harassment and toxicity

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,680
um are the things that we say in context

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,119
so

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,960
someone telling me um or someone even

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,599
saying to you you speak so well

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,079
like that can be extremely harmful right

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,560
but

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,960
to any kind of tone analyzer or

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,040
sentiment analysis that that seems

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,400
almost like a positive statement right

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,480
so i think

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
what's important to recognize is that

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,440
harassment

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,720
at times is not very blatant it's very

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,680
very contextual

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,720
and or it's tailored specifically to the

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,320
victim

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,440
so machine learning can't help

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,359
in i think analyzing that what does help

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,359
i think is training with diversity and

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,280
inclusion experts and racial justice

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,720
experts to recognize

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,320
those kinds of interactions when they

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,320
pop up for communities to build a plan

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
and a ladder of consequences and

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,680
implement that plan

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,680
and that ladder of consequences when

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,800
harm arises and to do it

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,599
quickly and to feel sort of confident

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
in their response meaning i know this a

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,520
lot

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,599
in a lot of different communities i've

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,119
been and um and particularly also in the

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,960
wikimedia community where

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,640
people would lean back a little bit and

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,720
say well how do we know

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,000
that that person like that maybe they

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,599
didn't mean it

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,520
and i always like to say like it doesn't

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,520
really like the intent

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,000
intent and impact are very different

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,480
things the intent of someone

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,119
doesn't lessen the impact of their

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,760
actions

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,200
or the harm of their actions i may not

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,920
intend to hurt you

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,359
but i have hurt you and so i think it's

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,640
important to separate

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:54,240
intent and impact when we're looking at

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,800
responding to varying levels of toxicity

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,800
and harm

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,720
yeah i i agree definitely i think

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,000
some of the most common

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,960
misunderstandings uh

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,160
or disconnect between people happen when

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
when

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,520
there is that gap between oh i actually

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,800
try to

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,480
say x and um and

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,040
and the impact that had was completely

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,960
different um

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,280
so i think acknowledging that that

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,440
that's that's the difference and

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,640
uh is probably one of the first steps

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,760
away from uh abuse or harassment

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,000
um let's go back a little bit to

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,440
to the research project that you're

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,119
working on right now

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,960
um you were talking about different uh

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,240
information inputs that you were

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,920
analyzing

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,920
uh from the different uh

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
companies that were providing data and

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,119
then uh there's also

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,040
a survey is that right uh yeah so

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,720
so we're not actually taking data from

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,720
companies we're looking at like

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,000
pre-existing literature that companies

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,040
have published

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,839
uh like their own findings in response

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,720
to

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,839
remote work during the pandemic what are

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,960
the next steps

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,000
uh when when you analyze uh

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,359
all of these data uh how

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,079
how do you hope to apply this uh

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,480
for you know is it going to be available

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,960
for

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
other companies to learn from uh is it

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,319
going to be accompanied by

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,000
a guide or how do you see this project

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,160
going forward

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,920
sure yeah thank you for that question um

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,000
it's it's going to be a research report

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,839
with specific recommendations for what

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,599
companies can do right now in this

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,280
moment we're

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,359
confident and hopeful that the

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,280
recommendations will will work for

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,640
varying size companies from companies

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,359
potentially as large as google

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,160
to companies as small as a consulting

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,240
firm of

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,800
one or two people right um so our goal

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,560
is to really create widespread impact

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
and also think about scale when

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,680
suggesting different kinds of

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,000
solutions and we are thinking about how

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,640
scale

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,640
affects implementation um primarily for

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,200
us we are trying to be really actionable

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,720
also

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,200
in these recommendations so they won't

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,240
be necessarily pie in the sky

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,960
recommendations but like

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,079
things we have learned from conducting

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,160
our research

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,599
um i can share a few with you like what

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,920
we've started to notice already though

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,319
we're

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
still in the process of um we're

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,359
finishing up research and we're going to

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,119
start writing soon

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,720
so one thing we've learned is that

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,800
companies really need

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,240
plans and structure and i know i've said

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,400
this earlier but

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,720
it's something where they need to have

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
an answer for every kind of scenario

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,000
that can pop up so one thing we've seen

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,000
is companies

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,920
offer free time or time off available to

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,440
employees that that would that is time

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
off that you don't have to take vacation

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
for

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,599
just like blanket time off during the

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
pandemic and what we've like learned

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,160
from different people we've interviewed

00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,760
is that

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,839
particularly like when their companies

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,960
offered this the company didn't actually

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:06,640
make a plan

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,680
of how someone could access that

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,680
time off and then it turned out that

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,280
time off was actually only available to

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,200
some employees with children so one

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,880
person or a few people we've interviewed

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,240
had really highlighted like wanting to

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,119
access this benefit

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,359
and their managers actually didn't know

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,920
how they could access that benefit so

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,040
the managers had to go up the chain and

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,880
then figure out

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,640
actually what that would look like so

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,960
the company

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,800
made time off available but they didn't

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,599
also make a plan

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,720
for who would fill in the gaps of that

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,240
time off so who

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,599
picks up the slack when part of like if

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,359
a third of the company decides to go 50

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,920
time so offering that kind of support

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,560
is one thing but you need to have a plan

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,839
to really

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,560
implement that support so the company

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,880
doesn't

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,560
fall into chaos and in this case there

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,520
wasn't really a plan

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,319
part of the implication was perhaps that

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,240
the

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,599
the employees that were not taking time

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,240
off would try to pick up some of the

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,000
slack but that doesn't alleviate

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,760
the employees who are working full-time

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,599
that doesn't alleviate their stress

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,839
or even the general anxiety they could

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,160
feel in response to

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,440
you know covet 19 and working from home

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,960
and and the general stress of the

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,800
pandemic which is

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,960
stressful so one thing we also noticed

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,280
is people generally feel

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,560
much more anxiety now than they have

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,119
before the pandemic

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,359
and while that may seem like an obvious

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,440
takeaway what that means is if

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,359
your company is letting some employees

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,520
take off and others not to

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,400
already emotionally taxed employees are

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,359
now more

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,920
taxed they're over taxed so that was a

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,920
big thing

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,319
another thing was we noticed some

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,520
companies

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,800
in response to working remotely uh

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,800
created no work plan so um some people

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,880
we interviewed remarked how

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,000
their day-to-day accountability was

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,680
actually just

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,319
like water cooler chats with their

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,920
manager so how do we translate a water

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,720
cooler chat

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,800
you know in a remote workplace that can

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,160
be someone just randomly slacking you

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,319
or sending you like a g chat but

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,319
while that sounds also innocuous imagine

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,760
if you're like knee deep in a problem

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,280
trying to problem solve something

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
and your manager just pings you out of

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,200
nowhere trying to switch gears to

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,880
respond to that like can be stressful

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,319
especially if you don't know when you're

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,560
going to get pinged

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,599
um that also means that at any point at

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,119
any time if you

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,640
you know got up to go to the bathroom

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,599
nobody knows that

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,880
and so some pings and you come back 20

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,680
minutes later they may be like where

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,079
were you

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,400
and if you're in if you're in a very

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,160
stressful workplace they may not

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,000
trust that you were working and didn't

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,079
see it they may make all kinds of

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,280
assumptions about your about your your

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,680
work right

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,960
so this is also what i mean is that this

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,920
lack of structure

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,400
um places a lot of stress on employees

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,800
because

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,480
it can be harder for them to show the

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,160
work that they did during a day because

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,280
there's no way

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
to um you know like there's no

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,200
outline of what they're supposed to do

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,640
right or also it just means that they're

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,599
working in these incredibly

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,200
stressful short sprints if every day the

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,760
plan is just tell your boss what you're

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,400
working on like that is not a good

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,480
project management plan so this also

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,160
increases anxiety

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,400
um also people are getting slacked

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,440
you know not during work hours and then

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,440
feeling

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,720
a general anxiety that they should be

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,680
available

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,079
you know to any message when in fact you

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,839
are

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,079
allowed to you know not respond to work

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,760
if it's like 8 p.m your time and that's

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,079
not the time you work

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,319
um so different things like that another

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,079
thing also is

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,760
some companies um we've noticed because

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,359
like their way to try to make

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,920
accountability is to just

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,119
fill the day with different zoom calls

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,880
and different or different kinds of

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,839
video calls and check-ins

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,359
which also doesn't make an easier work

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,440
day because if you spend

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,720
six hours in video calls when are you

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,839
supposed to actually

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,520
do your work um so so it's different

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,760
things like that that are actually

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,280
extremely problematic um and that are

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,200
really disruptive for people's work

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,520
styles and are increasing

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,480
the level of stress that they're feeling

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,200
yeah

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,599
and it sounds like uh some of the key

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,640
takeaways as you were mentioning is

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,599
designing uh more structure

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,480
for employees but also designing with a

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,359
user in mind

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,560
so if there is if there are benefits

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,000
around

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:51,040
um taking time off designing that

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,520
for the people that need it that may or

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,560
may not

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,480
have kids or may or may not have a

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,079
sick relatives of people they have to

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,599
take care of

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,640
um this is really fascinating i um

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,520
i hope that uh yeah that's uh i'm

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,000
looking forward to

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,599
to reading the report uh and seeing

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,720
where this goes

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,760
we covered all the topics that uh we

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,920
we had in our agenda is there

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,240
um anything else that i'm missing or

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,440
anything else that you would like to

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,559
um that you would like to

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,760
to speak about sure i mean

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,920
i think one thing i want to really

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,839
emphasize for for

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,520
for people listening to this is um

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,240
right now is a really stressful and

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,240
taxing time for anybody regardless

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,280
of the location they're in and just

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,760
regardless of

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,960
who they are but it is especially

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,359
stressful

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,880
for marginalized groups and people of

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,079
color right now

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,640
and that when we're designing things

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,200
that can feel as again mundane as a work

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,880
structure

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,960
they are those are not mundane

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,079
structures that will dictate how someone

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,800
spends

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,720
you know seven or eight or nine of their

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,720
like waking hours maybe even more like

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,280
10 or 12 depending upon where someone

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,480
works

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,440
and so one thing i often reflect on is

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,920
um

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,599
you know when i like i've been working

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,640
remotely since 2016

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,520
and at one place i worked at so much of

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,760
my day

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,760
was just being on video calls that i

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,640
didn't have enough time

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,720
in my day to actually do my job which

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,000
was doing design research

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,599
and my my manager didn't

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,440
really understand that like he didn't

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,160
understand if i had

00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,000
a meeting and then an hour of free time

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,839
and then two meetings and then an hour

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,960
of free time like why

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,800
i couldn't get my work done and it was

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,079
because he was not a researcher he was a

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,319
product manager

00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,480
and trying to explain to him how

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,319
difficult it is to switch gears from

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,359
writing to not writing

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,160
to then answering emails like that that

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,720
just wasn't

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,599
possible proved to be a really hard

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,920
conversation

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,040
with him and so one thing i want people

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,760
to think about is that

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,319
is like are they giving their employees

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,640
time

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,760
to build a work schedule that makes

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,319
sense for them

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,040
so for me what would have been helpful

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,720
is like

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,440
one day of work calls right

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,880
and then if like let's say in a week if

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,599
i needed to have

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,880
i don't know 15 work calls like can i

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,760
spread that out

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,559
across two days like can i put that in

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,800
to

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,000
two days of and that's it and then like

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,280
the rest of the week

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,880
can i have time for writing maybe

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,000
one-on-one feedback from like what i'm

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,040
writing etc like that would have been a

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,079
way for me to

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:51,359
like to have been successful in my job

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,440
and like my manager made it seem like

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,920
it was possible for that for our work to

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,760
be that flexible when it really wasn't

00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,359
um like no one no one would like respect

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,800
my time if i said like i'm actually full

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,960
of meetings right and

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,319
meetings being like i'm writing so

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,680
that's what i mean like i want people to

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,839
really reflect on that

00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,079
and interact with their employees and

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,040
ask like what do you need to be

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,920
most successful and then to listen to

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,640
their employees

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,599
and give them that space and those

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,599
boundaries

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,520
so they can actually succeed during a

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,359
time where it's really hard

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,200
one of our interviewees pointed out

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,480
something that even though they're

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,240
single

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,079
and they don't have dependents it's

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,480
really a stressful time for them because

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,440
they're

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,520
totally alone and that even doing basic

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,480
things like going to the doctor

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,640
can take three times as long right or

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,280
going and getting groceries and so

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,920
these regular mundane things we do are

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,119
also

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,319
much much harder to do and

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,559
their schedule wasn't allowing for that

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,920
and like their manager didn't seem to

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,280
understand that either

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,800
where it was like oh but you don't have

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,160
a dependent so why is it hard for you

00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,520
it's like well it is stressful going to

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,119
the grocery store if it takes me like

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,920
four hours to do that

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,960
you know or it is stressful if i get a

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,880
call from the doctor

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,480
and they suddenly have something open

00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,359
otherwise it's a three-month wait like

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,680
that that doesn't

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,680
you know that is stress inducing and so

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,720
this is what i mean where i think

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,240
companies can't just say that they're

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,480
listening or that they want to help they

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,559
actually have to put that help into

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,400
practice and design a system that

00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,040
responds to it

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,040
another person mentioned how their

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,000
workplace was going to have

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,680
like a day with no meetings but didn't

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,920
actually think about

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,960
well how do you redesign our work so we

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,200
need

00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,800
less meetings so it's like okay if you

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,240
give us a day with no meetings do all

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,920
the meetings

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,920
all the meetings have to go somewhere

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,319
else then unless we figure out a way to

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,559
really

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,240
eliminate meetings like or eliminate

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,920
some unnecessary meanings and this is

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,160
what i mean with a structure

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,520
saying you can have time off or saying

00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,200
we're going to have less meetings you

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,800
have to translate that

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,520
into a structure and a plan that makes

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,319
space and time for that that may mean

00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
bringing on

00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,680
you know for this one company that's

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,280
like you can all work part-time that may

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,160
mean bringing on more part-time

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,079
employees

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,359
so the work can still get done if

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,800
another company is saying we want to

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,720
have less meetings that means sitting

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,240
down and saying like

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,000
how can we translate some of these

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,839
meetings into

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,760
digital asynchronous stand-ups that

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:28,160
happen across uh

00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,200
like messaging platforms right how can

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:33,520
we better translate meetings into emails

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,640
thank you so much caroline thank you for

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,680
for joining this

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,960
fireside chat uh and for sharing uh what

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,920
you have learned

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,520
um and what you're learning in the in

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,800
the process as well

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,280
um and we look forward to to reading

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,559
the outcomes of the research yeah thank

00:52:49,280 --> 00:53:01,839
you i'll definitely share them when

00:52:50,559 --> 00:53:01,839
we're done

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,960
thank you for that kind of conversation

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,559
caroline and maria that was that was

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,800
really interesting to hear

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,480
and a lot of things really resonated me

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,040
as someone who's been working from home

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,040
for

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,559
many months at this point um

00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,400
particularly this idea

00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,319
of are you giving your employees the

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,240
flexibility to build their own work

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,760
schedules to meet their needs and

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,839
i feel like i'm someone who who

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,760
regularly blocks my calendars to ensure

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,440
that i have time to get things done

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,960
um but i've also found that in this sort

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,079
of blended work

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,280
personal life uh home environment it's

00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,119
nice to have

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
more structure and to use that

00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,280
aggressive calendar and blocking

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,119
activity as a way to ensure that i'm

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,880
at work when i need to be and then

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,280
somewhere else or at home when i need to

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,520
be

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,359
my personal self um so we're gonna have

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
another live poll again on the events

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,599
page

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,280
and we're gonna pose this question to

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,800
you how long have you been working

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,480
remotely

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,559
uh faizal what about you how long have

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,640
you been working remotely

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,119
yeah thanks for asking uh the role i was

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,640
in prior to this was fully remote so

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,880
i haven't worked in an office for

00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,160
several years now and i'm really looking

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,160
forward to getting back to the office

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,920
when it's safe to do so

00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,599
it sounds like a very long time and i'm

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,119
sure you have some great tips on how to

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,200
stay productive there

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,960
um all right we're gonna move on to the

00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,040
next topic and session

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,799
next we're going to hear from jules good

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,440
about the best practices for

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,440
virtual event accessibility take it away

00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,839
jules

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,040
hello everybody and welcome to engaging

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,799
everyone a

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,040
presentation about virtual event

00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,640
accessibility my name is jules good

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,359
and i'm so excited to be here with you

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,000
today so a little bit about me

00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:36,240
um i am a late deaf person and i have

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,359
faced a lot of accessibility barriers

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,280
in life um as i'm losing my hearing um

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,359
as i'm getting older and so i'm really

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,799
passionate about accessibility and

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,880
helping people

00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,480
be able to access you know community

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,200
events work events

00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,559
social things professional things and so

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,359
that's why i'm so excited to be here

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,200
with you today

00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,520
um to chat with you about how you can

00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,319
make your virtual events more accessible

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,839
i'm also the founder and uh consulting

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,200
lead at an organization called

00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,040
neighborhood access

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,400
and this is our whole goal is to work

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,839
with organizations

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,599
to make sure that their practices are

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,599
accessible to people with disabilities

00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,359
so why should you make your event

00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,440
accessible

00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,359
first off disabled people just like

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,319
anybody else care about things and want

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,760
to get involved

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,680
um in their communities and their

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,680
professional networks and all of these

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,960
networks where virtual events um would

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,680
pop up right which is pretty much

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,160
anywhere

00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,680
but our needs are often overlooked um

00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,119
even though we have a lot of valuable

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,119
perspectives to share

00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,319
and when our access needs are overlooked

00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,240
that makes it so that

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,799
we aren't able to participate as fully

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,480
in events and that can even discourage

00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,240
people from showing up to events in the

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,680
first place and that can just be a super

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,040
frustrating experience

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,280
so you want to make sure that your

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,119
events are accessible not only to get

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,720
more people to your event but also to

00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,799
make sure that everybody there can

00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,880
participate fully

00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,079
and lastly there are more of us than you

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,319
think the cdc

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,359
estimates that one in five people in the

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,000
united states

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,079
has some kind of disability while not

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,880
all of those disabilities

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,079
necessitate accommodations in the

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,040
virtual world

00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,640
a lot of them do um and by holding

00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,559
virtual events you're already needing

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,480
some access needs in the first place for

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,920
people who aren't able to go out

00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,599
um and and attend events in person so

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,440
this is really just about optimizing

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,280
your virtual events so that everybody

00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,880
can participate fully

00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,799
and have a really great time without all

00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,760
of the frustration and headache of

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,280
having to

00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,119
you know worry about whether things are

00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,280
going to be accessible

00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,119
so something that i really like to do

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,119
when scheduling events is to think about

00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,720
accessibility on a timeline so you want

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,640
to think about the things you need to do

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,319
a couple weeks before the event maybe

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,760
the week of the event and then during

00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,880
the event so those are kind of the three

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,400
chunks that we're going to go through

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,480
together right now

00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,839
so at least two weeks from your event

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,520
you're going to want to pick a platform

00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:57,599
that has a dial-in option

00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,799
and what i mean by that is when somebody

00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,880
is viewing the

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,000
uh the link to the event you want to

00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,720
make sure that there's an option for

00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,680
them to

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,119
use a phone number that's connected to

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,599
the event invitation

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,799
to dial in um with a cell phone landline

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,680
whatever

00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,559
the reason we want to do that is because

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,359
a lot of people

00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,960
use relay systems which are essentially

00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:22,240
systems that

00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,799
allow people to dial in a

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,280
captioner or an interpreter to a meeting

00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,200
so

00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,119
um you should absolutely be scheduling

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,720
an interpreter and or captioner for your

00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,599
meeting but if something happens in a

00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,119
pinch where

00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,520
you know you just have this event

00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,880
randomly pop up and there's no time

00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,720
then you want to make sure you have that

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,640
dial-in option so that

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,480
folks can utilize those those relay

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,079
services

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,160
another really simple thing you can do

00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,799
is ask this question on your event

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:51,040
registration page or on the rsvp

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,880
are there any accessibility tools we can

00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,599
provide to ensure you are able to

00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,400
participate

00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,160
fully in this event and what that does

00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,040
is it just allows you to get a really

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,359
like general idea of what kind of

00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,200
accommodations people are going to need

00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:07,599
um and that's just really helpful in

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,920
your planning for really large events

00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,760
um i would say that you know all of

00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,640
these tools that we're about to go

00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,520
through you should

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,119
follow just as the standard because you

00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,680
never know who's going to show up

00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,200
for small events um if you know exactly

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,799
who's gonna be there and exactly what

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,680
their needs are from asking this

00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,200
question

00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,119
then you know there might be certain

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,799
things that you can forego if it's just

00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,240
like something really tiny but these are

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,880
all just really good things to keep in

00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,440
mind

00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,960
in general because again you never know

00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,079
if some random person is going to show

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,680
up who has

00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,720
an accommodation that you didn't plan

00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,480
for and so it's good to just plan for it

00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,400
and be ready to deliver on that

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,839
accommodation if necessary

00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,760
another thing you need to do a couple

00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,799
weeks out from your event is schedule an

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,200
interpreter

00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:53,119
and or a captioner so there's kind of a

00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,920
hierarchy of these things that i like to

00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,359
think about

00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,119
if you're able to schedule an

00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,319
interpreter and a captioner you

00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,599
absolutely should

00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,440
the only thing that really limits

00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,920
organizations from doing both is

01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,520
uh budgetary restrictions but if you're

01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,000
able to do both you totally should

01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,319
because

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,599
both are really helpful the reason why

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,400
is because

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,079
a lot of people think that english and

01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,760
asl american sign language

01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,680
are the same language they're not

01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,400
they're really different asl has

01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,520
its own grammar its own structure its

01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,119
own syntax

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,280
um and so people who grew up with asl

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,440
as their primary language might have a

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,160
harder time reading captions at the

01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,000
speed

01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,680
that you know speech is being delivered

01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,640
so having an interpreter is really

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,960
helpful to provide

01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,920
full access especially to culturally

01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,280
deaf people

01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,720
and then on the flip side of that

01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,400
captions are really helpful for people

01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,319
who don't know sign language

01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,160
but are still hard of hearing or might

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,680
have some other kind of auditory

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,520
processing disorder

01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,200
and so you really want to have both to

01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,240
cater to the widest range of needs

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,720
possible

01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,400
if you can't i would say second from

01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,640
having both would be just having the

01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,160
captions because a lot more people can

01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,760
benefit from captions

01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,319
and then for whatever reason if you

01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,400
can't find captions at all and you're

01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:08,160
only able to get an interpreter

01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,520
um then of course that would be kind of

01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,520
at the bottom of the list

01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,799
absolutely it's better than nothing and

01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,480
will help people

01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,319
you know no matter what so you should

01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,799
definitely do that if that is your only

01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,640
option

01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,960
but if you can do both that would

01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,280
definitely be what i would suggest

01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,000
moving to one week out from the event so

01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,040
this is really

01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,040
all about formatting your materials and

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,119
preparing them so that they are

01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,119
optimized for accessibility

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,319
so the first thing you should do is

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,400
prepare to share

01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,480
your slides or your documents or any

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,160
visual aids with attendees

01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,680
in some situations it may not be

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,920
possible to share these

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,119
prior to the event but if you can you

01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,280
absolutely should

01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,400
the reason that this is really helpful

01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,200
is for people who use

01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,720
screen readers so a screen reader is a

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,520
piece of software

01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,559
that blind and low vision people use in

01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,039
order to

01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,839
have text that is on a screen read to

01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,920
them out loud

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,440
so it's like the opposite of speech to

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,680
text that we use on our phones

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,520
it's text to speech and so this is a

01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,799
really important tool for people to give

01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,039
them access to

01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,920
um to any text or anything that you

01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,119
would read

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,160
um on a screen and so the

01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,760
issue with having slides or documents um

01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,839
you know if you're screen sharing them

01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,319
on a teleconferencing platform

01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,440
um is that the screen reader doesn't

01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:28,240
recognize

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,039
um what's on the video as being text it

01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,400
just says oh

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,000
you know that's a video i don't have to

01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,680
read anything to whoever's using me

01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
because there's no text here

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,359
so when you are able to share slides and

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,119
documents ahead of time

01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,480
then people can use their screen readers

01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,760
they'll know what to prepare for it

01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,559
they'll have full access to the

01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,480
materials

01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,599
they won't have to play catch up after

01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,760
the fact

01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,400
so it's great to just be proactive with

01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,680
accessibility in that regard

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,359
another thing that's important when

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,799
you're formatting your visual materials

01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,480
is to add alt text

01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,720
which is sometimes also called image

01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,000
descriptions so this is also a screen

01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,240
reader related

01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,760
accommodation so when a screen reader

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,079
comes across a picture

01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,359
on your screen unless there's alt text

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,880
it just says oh there's a picture i

01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,799
don't have to do anything with that

01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,319
um and then the person using the screen

01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,359
reader doesn't have access to whatever

01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,400
is in that image

01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:17,839
so when we add alt text um it basically

01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,359
sends a message to the screen reader

01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,000
that says hey this is what's in this

01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,000
picture

01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
so let's do an alt text practice with

01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
this picture of me and my dog here

01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,920
so if i were to add alt text to this

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,839
image i would say

01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,440
this is a picture of a small black

01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:34,559
chihuahua curled up

01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,520
on a person's lap um and they are maybe

01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,240
sleeping

01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,319
um so super simple you're just giving an

01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,319
idea of what's going on in the image

01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:44,000
um doesn't have to be super super

01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,599
detailed notice i didn't talk about

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,240
you know the pattern on my shirt or

01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,799
what's going on in the background

01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,920
it's just an idea of whatever the most

01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:55,440
important

01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,319
content of that image is the next thing

01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,200
you're going to want to do

01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:00,880
is format your materials with headings

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,880
and proper fonts

01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,880
so obviously this is for materials that

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,839
have text associated with them

01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,119
um so if you have long documents you

01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,520
want to make sure that those have

01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,440
headings and not just headings that you

01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,520
make by hitting you know control b

01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,839
and making something bold or italicized

01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,880
or whatever but headings that are

01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:22,400
selected from your word processors

01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,000
settings to say like oh yeah this is

01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,599
heading one this is heading two

01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,280
um this is normal text this is a

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,839
subheading yada yada

01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,880
and that is helpful for screen readers

01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,039
in terms of

01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,559
um understanding the organization of the

01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,240
page so that it can

01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,079
read to the person using the screen

01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,000
reader um you know

01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,760
a lot more coherently and not have it

01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,880
just be like a random

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,760
stream of words and with fonts what we

01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,799
want to consider

01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,039
is serif versus sans serif fonts so

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,920
serif fonts are fonts like times new

01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,359
roman

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,599
um or gothic um that have you know those

01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,720
little lines kind of at the edge of each

01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,119
part of the letter

01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,640
um and sans serif fonts would be fonts

01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,920
like the ones on this slide

01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,920
that don't have any of those little

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,079
lines so it's just like the simplest

01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,960
kind of smoothest form that the letter

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,400
can be in

01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,799
and the reason it's important to use

01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,039
sans serif fonts is because the serrath

01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:17,599
can make it more difficult for people

01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,160
um particularly people with visual

01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,559
processing disorders like dyslexia

01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,920
to discern between letters um it makes

01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,359
it easier for things to kind of get

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,559
jumbled together when we have all those

01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:29,359
extra lines so

01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,960
the cleanest most sans-serify font that

01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,680
you can find is going to be the best way

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,280
to go

01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,440
another thing that you should do is

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,400
provide the interpreter with a list of

01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,359
key terms

01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,200
i know with all of our tech meetings and

01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,640
you know our industry specific terms

01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,480
there's a lot of jargon in there that

01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,319
sometimes we don't even think about

01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,720
um and you want to make sure that any of

01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:51,119
those acronyms those proper nouns

01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,839
names you know any really technical

01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,000
language

01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,960
you are um giving the interpreter a

01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,079
heads up of

01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,839
the kind of language that you're going

01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,200
to be using so just like a list of those

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,599
words super easy

01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,799
and that way um they're able to prepare

01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,200
for that ahead of time

01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,079
um you know practice fingerspelling um

01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,680
any

01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,240
any words that are like super long or

01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,880
complicated or maybe finding the signs

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,680
um for words that aren't as commonly

01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,039
used

01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,839
so that is just going to be super

01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,440
helpful for your interpreter in the

01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,880
meeting and lastly as you're setting the

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,720
agenda for your meeting you're going to

01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,280
make sure that you're scheduling breaks

01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,559
into the event so i like to follow the

01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,520
35 rule

01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,000
which means that for every 30 minutes of

01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,079
you know

01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,680
lecture style presentation like right

01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,400
now where i'm like just kind of talking

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,960
at you

01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,280
um that you provide a five minute break

01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,520
after each of those 30 minute segments

01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,200
and you know it's not always possible to

01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,119
follow this and i understand that

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,359
different um schedules and different

01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,280
agendas um call for different things

01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,720
but just try to scatter a couple short

01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,280
breaks throughout your event

01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,400
this is not only good for people who

01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,960
might struggle with

01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,160
um attention um you know people like me

01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,760
with add

01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,359
um who just have a really hard time

01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,720
sitting still um

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:06,160
but also for folks who um have maybe

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,559
medical needs that come up throughout

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,119
the day or on bathroom related needs

01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,240
where

01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,000
you know they're just gonna need a

01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,079
little bit of time to just do that

01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,520
self-care make sure that they've got you

01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,920
know other medication and

01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,559
all of that stuff figured out um so that

01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,160
they are

01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,200
at the top of their game for the

01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,119
duration of your event

01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,559
and lastly we have the things you should

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,240
do during your event

01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,680
so the first of these would be audio

01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,400
cues and these kind of come into two

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,880
forms

01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,920
the first would be um your initial

01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,839
introductions

01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,599
and the second is throughout the event

01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,559
so in the initial introductions you just

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,039
want to give a quick

01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,000
visual description of yourself and what

01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,680
this does is

01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,440
it helps people who are blind or low

01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,079
vision um just kind of

01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,680
have some you know verbal thing to

01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,559
remember you by other than the sound of

01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,720
your voice

01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,240
so when i say like oh hey you know it's

01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,440
jewels talking they can be like oh yeah

01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,440
that's the person who said they were

01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,000
wearing a yellow blazer like i i kind of

01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,319
remember

01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,839
um you know how to distinguish them from

01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:04,319
somebody else

01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,440
and so the initial introduction you just

01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,200
want to say like

01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,799
this is how i would do mine if i was in

01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,400
a meeting right now hi

01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:14,960
i'm jules i have brown hair i'm white

01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,640
and um i am wearing a yellow blazer with

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,000
a green shirt underneath and some

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,600
rainbow colored earrings

01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,600
you know any of what you want to say in

01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,199
that visual description is optional and

01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,560
up to you but if you can just give

01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,799
you know a quick overview of what you

01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,839
look like any kind of key accessories or

01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,839
whatever you're wearing

01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,600
that is really helpful for folks and

01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,799
then the other type of audio cue is what

01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,359
you do during the event

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:37,120
so this is not only helpful to uh blind

01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,199
and low vision folks because

01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,480
um you know keeping track of everybody's

01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,920
the sound of everybody's voice

01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,040
especially if you've just met them is

01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,279
really difficult

01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,960
um so when you're switching between

01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,120
speakers just make sure that you

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,799
reintroduce yourself real quick um when

01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,480
it's your turn to speak again

01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,920
so it's helpful in that regard and then

01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,199
it's also helpful for folks who are

01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,159
using interpreters because then the

01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,480
interpreter can say

01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,319
oh yeah that's jules talking or oh yeah

01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,640
that's dan talking or whoever

01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,839
um so that the person who's you know

01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,880
relying on the interpreter for

01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,679
communication

01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,040
um can also have an easier time uh

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,799
keeping track of you speaking at what

01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,880
time

01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,400
another thing that's really important um

01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,080
is content warnings

01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:21,120
so these are especially um important

01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,880
because there are certain um visuals or

01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,880
sounds that can trigger people to have

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,000
different reactions um you know even as

01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,400
serious as

01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,759
triggering a seizure or a panic attack

01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,239
or something that is just really not

01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,640
going to be

01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,920
a fun time when you're on screen with a

01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,000
bunch of different people

01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,279
so um there are kind of three things

01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,960
that you definitely want to make sure

01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,560
you include content warnings for

01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,719
if you have any visuals that have

01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,480
flashing lights you know like a really

01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,319
commonly known one is strobes but just

01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,600
kind of flashing lights in general

01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:52,480
any rapidly transitioning graphics so if

01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,480
you're like going through a you know

01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,760
slideshow of photos like a million miles

01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,360
an hour or something

01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,520
you want to make sure you put a content

01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,120
warning for that and then also

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,080
any sudden um and especially sudden loud

01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,840
noises

01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,840
um those can be really bothersome for

01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,960
folks so just a couple of minutes before

01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,640
those things happen

01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,719
or even you know give people a 10 second

01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,480
countdown before those things happen

01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,800
is really just going to help to keep the

01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,239
participants of your meeting safe

01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,080
and while we often don't think about

01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:22,960
safety in terms of

01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,880
you know maybe virtual events this is

01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,880
definitely an area where safety is

01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,080
really important

01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,480
another thing you should do is to

01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:33,760
prepare for interpreter questions

01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,960
so um you know sometimes your internet

01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,199
might cut out

01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,800
or um there's some background noise

01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,520
that's like making it hard to understand

01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,800
what you're saying

01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,320
the interpreter is going to cut in and

01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,600
say hey i didn't understand what you

01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,719
said can you repeat that

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,480
and that's because they want to make

01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,840
sure that you know the person who's

01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,880
relying on the interpreter for

01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,360
communication

01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,560
has full access to the information um

01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,400
that's being relayed

01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,080
just prepare for those questions related

01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,360
to clarification because that's really

01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,360
going to be helpful for the folks who

01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,800
are relying on the interpreters

01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,880
and lastly we want to make sure that

01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,040
we're describing visual elements

01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,560
um verbally so let's do an example of

01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,440
that together right now

01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,560
so if i was going to describe this graph

01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,480
in a way

01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,679
that a blind or low vision person could

01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,560
understand it

01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,640
i would say this is a pie chart that

01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,920
shows the number of points that each

01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,880
team scores

01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,960
team one scored 21.8 percent team two

01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,360
scored 32.7 percent of points

01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,760
team three scored 10.9 percent of points

01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,480
and team four scored 34.5 percent of

01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,880
points

01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,560
so now you've just you know described

01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,400
basically what's going on in this chart

01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,400
now there are situations where

01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,080
if you have a gazillion data points it's

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,760
not going to be effective

01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:46,320
um or you know time effective

01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,800
to to describe each point like i just

01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,360
did

01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,199
so you can say um just kind of the

01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,679
general trend of the graph so

01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,360
if this pie chart for example had like a

01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,480
lot more data points but

01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:01,280
um team four had still scored the

01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,800
the biggest amount of points i would say

01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,480
here's a pie chart there's a lot of

01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,280
information here but we can see that

01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,880
team four

01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,640
scored the most amount of points and

01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,000
team three scored the least amount of

01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,000
points so you just kind of want to

01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,040
identify the pieces of information that

01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,239
are important

01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,080
and then make sure that you're

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,760
communicating those verbally and not

01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,840
just pointing them out visually

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,120
and that will make sure that everybody

01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,320
has full access to

01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,400
you know the information that you're

01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,320
trying to describe

01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,600
and that brings us to the end of the

01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,679
presentation

01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,800
um i just want to remind you you know

01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,840
hopefully as

01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,080
um covid dies down and we're able to

01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,560
start having in-person events again

01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,080
um that you should continue to have a

01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,480
virtual event option

01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,080
um when you have in-person events um

01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,440
like i was saying earlier there's a lot

01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,239
of folks who aren't going to be able to

01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,159
make it

01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,159
out to in-person events for a variety of

01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,800
reasons so having that virtual option

01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,440
will really

01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,080
improve engagement with your event um

01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,840
and

01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,679
you know i hope that when you do

01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,440
continue having virtual events that you

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,400
will use these tips and tricks

01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,159
um and that you will be able to

01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,040
facilitate an event that

01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:08,640
really is engaging and meaningful and

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:19,840
inclusive of everyone

01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:19,840
thank you so much

01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,960
thank you jules for those great insights

01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,800
on how to ensure

01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,199
virtual events are accessible to

01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,120
everyone i do hope we continue to have

01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:47,440
thoughtful virtual programs even as we

01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,679
begin to return to the workplace

01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,040
next up we'll go to the live poll how

01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,440
accessible do you find

01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,080
the current state of virtual events

01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,239
sophia

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,520
how would you answer this question i

01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:00,480
feel like i want to pick

01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,440
the extreme opposites here and that i've

01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,400
i've experienced

01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:07,040
both highly accessible events in one

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,080
example last year i participated in a

01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,600
local

01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,840
developer open source meetup in rwanda

01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,440
that i for 15-minute presentation

01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,719
probably would not have flown halfway

01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,920
around the world and it was kind of

01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,320
incredible to be able to

01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,600
interact with a totally distinct and

01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,400
different community in a different

01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,520
country

01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,840
um but at the other hand attending large

01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,000
live streamed events has been very

01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,280
challenging to stay engaged and feel

01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,040
connected to

01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,120
the rest of the attendees as we're all

01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,679
kind of watching this in a one-to-many

01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,159
format

01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,120
so i feel like i've seen both extremes

01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,719
of this

01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,000
um and i think there's always going to

01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,239
be room for improvement in any model

01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,199
yeah couldn't agree more thanks everyone

01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,520
for your input there

01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,719
uh next we'll hear from annie

01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,760
jean-baptiste

01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,600
and leanne about

01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,840
google's product inclusion journey take

01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,840
it away

01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,719
hi everyone and welcome to the product

01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,640
inclusion at google session

01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,560
my name is annie jean-baptiste and i

01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,800
lead product inclusion at google

01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,400
and my name is leanne ihara and i lead

01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,920
product inclusion for platforms and

01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,679
ecosystems

01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,199
at google we talk a lot about building

01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,960
products for everyone

01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,960
but we also believe that it's important

01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,560
to build products with everyone because

01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,400
you can't assume you know what someone

01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,800
needs without asking them

01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,480
it's critical that teams ask who else

01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,159
who else needs to be in the room

01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,239
who else needs to be at the table so

01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,760
that we can collaborate and co-create

01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,080
with voices that have historically been

01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,679
at the margins

01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,960
google's mission is to organize the

01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,120
world's information and make it

01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,880
universally accessible and useful

01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,239
so that means no matter where you are in

01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,239
the world who you love

01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,840
how much money you make or what color

01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,960
your skin is or any of the things that

01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,400
make you you

01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,480
you should feel that google is helpful

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,400
to you in the moments that matter most

01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,159
and so product inclusion is really about

01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,280
not just building for some but building

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:45,440
for billions of people

01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:47,360
all over the world product inclusion

01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,040
is unique because it brings 12

01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,880
dimensions of diversity and the

01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,679
intersections of those dimensions to the

01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,440
table

01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,360
it builds on amazing work like

01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,440
accessibility work but again

01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,880
looking at intersections of multiple

01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,199
dimensions of diversity

01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,880
and how that affects a user's experience

01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,560
you're seeing some of the dimensions of

01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,679
diversity on this slide

01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,640
things like gender race age ability and

01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,040
more

01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,040
using myself as an example i'm a black

01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,640
woman who's also left-handed

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,560
it's not like i'm black on monday

01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,760
left-handed on tuesday and a woman on

01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,000
wednesday

01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,760
all of these things are a part of who i

01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,400
am and they affect how i move through

01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,320
the world

01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,000
how the world interacts with me and how

01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,840
i interact with products

01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,600
so if i'm using scissors for example

01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,360
being left-handed is the only thing that

01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,840
is going to be predominant

01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:37,600
but if i'm trying to take a photo being

01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,600
black and a woman can intersect

01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,600
product inclusion is an end-to-end

01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,719
system so it's not just a checklist or

01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,800
point in time

01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,320
and we really try to encourage teams to

01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,239
make sure that they're thinking about

01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,840
product inclusion at critical points in

01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,440
the product design process

01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,520
so what you're seeing here are what we

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,080
call inflection points or points where

01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,840
teams

01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,440
can really be proactive about bringing

01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,520
that inclusive lens

01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,960
teams can come into any point but we

01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,640
really try to prioritize

01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,960
bringing product inclusion in as early

01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,159
as possible so we can take learnings at

01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,320
each of the phases

01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:09,600
and build on them so that it cascades

01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,320
through a truly

01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,760
helpful product at the end we've also

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,679
found that there are four points where

01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,320
teams keep coming back to time and time

01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,640
again

01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,360
and those are the ideation user research

01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,360
and design

01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:24,719
user testing and marketing phases which

01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,719
we'll talk about in a little bit

01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,239
it's important to also talk about the

01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,679
business case for inclusion

01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:31,600
there's a misconception that

01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,600
underrepresented groups don't have power

01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,679
and that's simply not true so what

01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,520
you're seeing here are some stats around

01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,600
different underrepresented groups

01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,080
for example there are 1 billion people

01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,600
in the world with a permanent disability

01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,760
we're seeing trillions of dollars in

01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,199
purchasing power from black and hispanic

01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,199
latinx consumers

01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:50,880
and there are 700 million people who are

01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,480
coming online in the next few years from

01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,040
places like nigeria

01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,000
so it really behooves any business and

01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,920
organization

01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,760
to think about how they bring those

01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,679
perspectives voices and needs of these

01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,360
historically underrepresented users

01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,880
into the center and really highlight

01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,640
them in product design

01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,080
as i mentioned there are four main

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,520
points in the product design process

01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,760
where we've really focused on with

01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,520
product teams this is done because

01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,199
over a year we did some research on the

01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,880
business case for inclusion

01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,800
and we found that these were points that

01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,880
were really impactful

01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,480
in the output of our product teams and

01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,800
for our products and services

01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,520
and those are the ideation user research

01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,679
and design

01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,679
user testing and marketing phases

01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,760
we found that teams that were acting

01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,840
with an inclusive lens

01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,080
did so at least two of the four process

01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,800
points so that may be ideation and

01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,400
marketing

01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,560
that may be user research and user

01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,520
testing but i think that signals that

01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,679
it's not just

01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,280
a box hit check we really want teams to

01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,000
think holistically about product

01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,840
inclusion

01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,280
and think holistically about their

01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,880
product design process and how they can

01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:57,440
make it more inclusive and equitable

01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,440
we also found that both underrepresented

01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,199
and majority groups prefer inclusive

01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:03,280
marketing and product design

01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:04,400
so this may be surprising to some and

01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,679
they may think that only

01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,440
underrepresented groups want to see

01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:08,320
themselves reflected accurately and

01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,679
beautifully

01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,159
but actually what we found were the

01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,719
majority of users actually wanted to see

01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,239
that

01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,320
and so i think we'll continue to see

01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:19,120
trends like this where consumers are

01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,560
really expecting brands to reflect the

01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,400
beautiful diversity of the world

01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,120
around us we also found that regardless

01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,440
of makeup

01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,199
teams that proactively think about

01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,239
product inclusion are intentional about

01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,760
setting goals

01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,679
can create more inclusive products

01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,000
regardless of their team makeup

01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:38,080
i think this is very encouraging because

01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,320
even if teams are working to get to

01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,520
representation that accurately reflects

01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,280
the world around us

01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,840
they can still build more inclusive

01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,480
products they just have to be

01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,159
intentional proactive

01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:50,159
about it and really think about

01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:51,679
accountability for themselves and their

01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:53,440
teams

01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,960
and now we'll go into some examples of

01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,920
what product inclusion looks like in

01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,600
action

01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,679
the first one is our black owned

01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,120
business attribute which is a part of

01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,600
our racial justice

01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:05,040
work streams when a business wants to

01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,040
denote that they're black owned

01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,120
they're able to do this and have this

01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,360
icon on google search

01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:13,440
and our other properties this is really

01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:16,320
exciting because people can celebrate

01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,159
highlight and traffic these different

01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,400
black owned businesses

01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:22,000
we've also seen a lot of work done to

01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,960
make sure that all skin tones render

01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,880
accurately

01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,360
so here's a quick video of the work that

01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,840
we've done with google camera

01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,360
pictures tell stories it doesn't really

01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,199
matter if it's a selfie

01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,120
or if it's a portrait that somebody is

01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:38,960
taking of another person

01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,960
you are sharing in that human moment

01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:45,600
uh let's take a picture of you too one

01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:49,040
two three no

01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,040
he's too dark

01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,239
so this is where the discussion started

01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,760
here just use my phone

01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:59,360
it's got a better sensor a better sensor

01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,880
and what does that even mean color

01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,320
tuning is an extremely complicated

01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,639
process

01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,600
when we look at images what we try to do

01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,040
is figure out

01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,360
how much of a difference there is

01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,159
between let's say a reference image

01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,920
and the image that we actually are

01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:16,400
trying to quantify

01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,159
we were running some tests on a product

01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,960
and it was the proximity sensor we were

01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,800
testing

01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,639
and we said oh it looks like it does 60

01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,040
centimeters and we look to each other

01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,560
and go

01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:29,199
we're both white the technology itself

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,239
as many people will say is not racist

01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,280
it's just that it wasn't

01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:34,719
tested properly to make sure that the

01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,520
designers weren't

01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,800
unconsciously biased hey there's an

01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,080
entire world out there and we want to

01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,199
make sure this works for everybody

01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,679
[Music]

01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:46,800
i love the fact that we get to influence

01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,719
cameras that we get to

01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,239
share those experiences of life and

01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,520
emotion to me that is

01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:56,880
what imaging is about it is a vehicle

01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,480
to express humanity take a picture of

01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:07,040
you too

01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:09,679
one two three

01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,679
thanks annie those are great examples

01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,760
i'd like to dig into the

01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,840
to what's involved in delivering an

01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,000
inclusive camera experience

01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,040
and to do that i want to use the work

01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,520
that's taking place in the android team

01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,320
so they've embarked upon this multi-year

01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,239
journey

01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,679
to systematically increase face

01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:30,719
diversity

01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,880
with really a goal of providing more

01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,800
inclusive face detection

01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,000
and to understand their goal of face

01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,239
detection

01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,440
is to realize that for digital

01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:42,639
photography

01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:46,639
face detection really can impact

01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:49,679
how skin tone is rendered subject focus

01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,360
and even exposure metering

01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,800
so the way they did that was to

01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,520
systematically

01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,400
um look at how they're testing both the

01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,199
front and you

01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,040
front and rear facing cameras and to

01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:03,679
come up with a consistent approach

01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,120
to to testing and you can see in the

01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,000
upper right hand corner

01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,400
this was their original starting test

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,440
and

01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,760
what they realized was that you didn't

01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,080
have consistent results over time to

01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,199
to be able to detect faces in that in

01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,360
that scene

01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,400
and so they started to they neutralized

01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,719
the background

01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,600
they neutralized the clothing that the

01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,159
subjects

01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,480
wore and then they also increased the

01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:29,520
the size of the faces that comprise the

01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,080
scenes

01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,199
and with this consistent framework for

01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,880
measurement

01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:37,600
they started to layer in different

01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:40,880
dimensions of diversity such as gender

01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,000
race looking at physical attributions

01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,440
such as hair

01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,960
or glasses accessories and most recently

01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,840
in android r

01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:52,000
they incorporated age diversity as part

01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:55,199
of the scenes for testing

01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,840
and these tests are then

01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,320
carried out by all of the oems that

01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,960
build

01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,360
products on android and so what you have

01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,000
then

01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:07,199
is an increasing performance and an

01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,600
improvement in the ecosystem over time

01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:11,679
when we think about product inclusion

01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,320
there are three principles that hold

01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,760
hold true and the first principle is

01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,760
address the user

01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,280
and what we're talking about here is

01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,679
really understanding

01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,520
the 12 dimensions of diversity that

01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,360
annie mentioned earlier

01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,920
and really thinking about how they come

01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:30,000
together for users and the product

01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,960
we want to think very holistically about

01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,760
the user

01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:36,159
and understand how historically

01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,880
marginalized users

01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,679
can be brought to the center and part of

01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,520
our focus

01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,520
when we are developing products

01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,600
the second principle is start with

01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,440
equity and there are a couple of things

01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,600
that we want to keep in mind

01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,080
when we think about this principle and

01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,480
this principle is really about

01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:59,120
ensuring that at every stage of the

01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:02,320
product development life cycle

01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:04,480
equity and product inclusion is a real

01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,679
focus for us and that is not just an

01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,400
afterthought

01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,679
and how we actually activate this second

01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,639
principle

01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,840
is about understanding who's represented

01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,320
in the product

01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,320
and and more importantly who's not and

01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,360
asking who else we need to bring to the

01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,840
table

01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,440
to to really influence the design

01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,639
direction and the decisions that

01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,920
we're making about the product and in

01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,560
order to do that

01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,120
we need to understand what the critical

01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,760
user journeys are for the product

01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,840
the key performance indicators and we

01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,800
need to be able to measure

01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,679
performance and how user how different

01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,360
users

01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,199
are actually interacting with the

01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,080
product and how

01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:50,320
how well or how not so well they're

01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,880
actually succeeding

01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:56,639
in in in the kinds of outcomes that we

01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,639
intend for them to experience

01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,480
and the last principle is about

01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,560
continually testing

01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,800
so we all have these going in

01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,840
assumptions about the product and how

01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,840
it'll land

01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,639
and we want to be able to measure how

01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,400
those how the product actually lands

01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,639
and then we also want to be able to

01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,719
refine the product over time

01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,840
based on feedback that we're receiving

01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:19,840
from users in the field

01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,880
when we think about product inclusion

01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,560
it's

01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,199
it's not something that a single

01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:31,679
individual or a single team can do

01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,639
but it's really about a commitment and a

01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,880
value

01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,800
that takes place across the entire

01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,920
company

01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:43,199
it is it's a commitment to intention

01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:46,159
if you will and really the intention to

01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:48,080
to take a stop and listen and more

01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:49,920
importantly to take action

01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,679
on the feedback that you're receiving

01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:54,000
from individuals

01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,800
and what we found is that when you

01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,120
actually

01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,520
focus on and center on these

01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,840
underrepresented voices

01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,920
the end product is beneficial for

01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:15,840
everyone

01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:15,840
thank you

01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,080
my

01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,840
thank you annie and leanne diversity

01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,679
equity and inclusion have been an

01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,679
ongoing commitment for many companies

01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,800
including google and i thought it was

01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,159
great to see

01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,760
all the different kinds of roles and

01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:44,000
functions that are involved in bringing

01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:47,120
in and ensuring perspective across the

01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,920
product design and life cycle and i say

01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,480
that's something that

01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,400
maybe project leads can learn from as in

01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,840
smaller communities there's maybe only a

01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,280
handful of engineers that are working on

01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,880
any given project and

01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,880
this kind of really highlights the need

01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,800
for an extended list of

01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,960
individuals with a variety of background

01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,280
and function to ensure that you are

01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,440
bringing in this idea of inclusion for

01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,440
all at all stages of your project

01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,560
on the expansion of your project um so

01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,520
that's the end of our

01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,960
content for today's event um i feel like

01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,880
i've learned a lot i think

01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,560
in particular one of my key takeaways

01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,000
was from jules's session

01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:24,000
in virtual event um and i get a lot of

01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,159
presentations and i put up a lot of

01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,120
data and often i organize it in a way

01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,199
that ensures

01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,120
my participants and recipients can

01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:32,800
glance at it and get a gist of what i

01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,239
what i'm trying to accomplish or state

01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,679
in that in that slide

01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:37,920
but i have to remember that not everyone

01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,719
can see it or see it clearly and i think

01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,520
i would love to

01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,440
have more visual cues uh to help others

01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,960
that are maybe less able to see

01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,639
what's in front of them so i thought

01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,239
that was that was a great tip

01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,159
uh faizal what about you what did you

01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:51,920
learn from this today

01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:53,280
yeah so many great takeaways i think one

01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,560
thing that stood out for me i'm all

01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,320
about the numbers and so

01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,120
i believe it was annie jean-baptiste to

01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:00,560
mention that 700 million more people

01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,320
will come online in the next year alone

01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,320
and i think thinking about how we

01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,520
include them most effectively is a

01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,639
interesting challenge that i'm looking

01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,440
forward to

01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:11,520
absolutely agree okay well that's a wrap

01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:13,600
it's almost time for the after party

01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,040
we've updated the google meet link to

01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,880
join it the after party

01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:19,120
please look for a button in the agenda

01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,600
page today speakers will also be joining

01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,360
us

01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,960
and we'll have some polls some

01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,400
interactive activity and a surprise

01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,920
guest

01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:35,840
