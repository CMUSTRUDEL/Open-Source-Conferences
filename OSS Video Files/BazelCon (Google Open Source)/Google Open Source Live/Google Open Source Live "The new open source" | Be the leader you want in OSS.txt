Description: 
	Stronger open source leadership can address a myriad of challenges. Good news! Every contributor is a leader either through self leadership, leading others, or leading the community, yet most people have never been trained on how to lead.This session teaches you how to be the leader you need in open source.

Hi, I'm Megan Byrd-Sanicki and I'm a manager at Google's Open Source Programs Office

00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,590
and I'm so excited that you're here to learn about being a leader in open source.

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,460
And I just want to thank you for making time for this important topic

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,070
because when we have more leaders in our open source projects

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,120
they become healthier, and we all end up making a greater impact together.

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,590
So today I'm going to cover what is leadership

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,530
and how can we strengthen our leadership skills?

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,800
And I'm going to provide some tips that you can start using today

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,030
to be the leader that you need in open source.

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,970
So hopefully that sounds great and why don't we get started with a story

00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,640
that does a pretty good job illustrating what leadership looks like in open source.

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,000
A few years ago, I was working on a project where we wanted to improve

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,180
the contributor experience, and we were interviewing all kinds of contributors

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,180
to get their history and what worked and what didn't work.

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,360
And one story always comes to mind.

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,890
It's a common story.

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,860
This person wanted to contribute, make their first contribution to the project

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,750
and they went to the forums

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,390
they went to the issue queues, and they found that it was a very intimidating process.

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,810
People were a little aggressive in these different channels

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,799
and they were talking at

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
a higher level than what a newcomer might be used to.

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,770
And so this person just did not know how to engage and didn't feel comfortable

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,770
starting the process for contributing.

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,140
And unfortunately they waited an entire year before they made their first commit

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,000
which is really unfortunate.

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
But they realized the situation they were in.

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,080
They had a goal and they took the right steps to move forward.

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,369
They reached out to a mentor and asked this volunteer if they would provide help.

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,340
And of course, this volunteer did a great job

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,450
and this contributor made their first commit.

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,490
And because of a learning mindset, they contributed again and again and again.

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,340
And today, this contributor is one of the top contributors for this project,

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
which just is amazing.

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:34,000
But it's also just a real shame because this project was losing a lot

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,040
because of these experiences that were happening in these forums.

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,830
With just this contributor alone, they lost 400 commits a year.

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,200
And then how many contributors did they lose because people just couldn't break through

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,770
the way this one contributor did?

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,550
And the answer's just too many, and it doesn't have to be this way.

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,260
People don't want it to be this way.

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,370
It's just that often, many people step up to help in open source, as you do

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,780
but they don't realize they're actually stepping into leadership roles

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,380
and it's not identified that way.

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,750
And it's not clear how to conduct yourself when you're in these leadership roles

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,690
and it can start to get a little messy and confusing for everyone.

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,110
And that's why I like to provide this kind of training

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,830
so people are more self-aware of how to conduct themselves, how to lead others

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,580
how to get things done in a healthy way within open source.

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,830
And so I'd love to just use this story to kind of unpack what leadership is

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,550
because there's a lot of leadership stories in here.

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,690
So the first one is, "Who were the leaders in this story?"

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,459
And the answer is the forum moderator.

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,930
The people working in the issue queues were helping, but they were also leading.

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,240
They had great influence over the project and

00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,690
what was happening in these channels.

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,080
The other leader was the mentor

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,940
a volunteer who gave up time and helped this person with achieving their goal.

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,720
The other person who was a leader, which might be a little surprising

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,239
is the contributor because they had to lead themself to get a positive outcome

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,130
and to achieve a goal.

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,440
And so I'm going to explore what that means to be

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,100
an individual leader a little bit more in this session

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,780
because at the end of the day

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,449
it's all of us individuals working in open source

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:34,490
and we all have to know how to lead ourselves towards a good, positive outcome.

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,370
So what is leadership?

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,680
There's a lot of definitions.

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,539
There's not one specific one

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,580
but this is one that I like a lot

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,770
which is that, "Leadership is a process of social influence

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,860
which maximizes the efforts of others towards the achievement of a goal."

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,499
So it is about influencing, bringing people along in a journey

00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:59,509
so that they want to do something with you

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:02,039
and achieving something together

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,530
something they all want to achieve together.

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,680
That's ultimately what leadership is.

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,029
And leadership is sometimes better defined by what it is not.

00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,610
So leadership is not a title.

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,619
It's not a role.

00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,119
You don't need to be a CEO, VP

00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:28,360
whatever title, project lead, in order to be a leader.

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Anyone can lead.

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,919
It's also not a specific personality type

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:39,060
so you don't need to be really outgoing in order to be a leader.

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,210
There's lots of introverts who lead as well.

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,369
It's also important to point out that leadership is not management.

00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:47,949
Management is about making sure everyone's following policies

00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,460
and process and rules and budgets and things like that.

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,710
Leadership is different, and it is not about power.

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,509
It is not about getting people to do things because you have power or authority.

00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,319
It's truly about influence.

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,080
And there are different kinds of leadership types.

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,879
There's leading organizations.

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,879
So in a company, that might be a CEO.

00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,069
In a project, it might be the project lead.

00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:19,240
It could be an executive director at a foundation for an open source project.

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,759
And there's leading others.

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,050
So managers lead others on a team

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,050
or product managers work across many teams to build and release a product.

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,580
In open source, you have someone who might be in charge of all of the form moderators

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,809
or the issue queues or the mentors.

00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:45,770
And then the third one is leading yourself, and this is what the contributor was.

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,779
This is all of us trying to figure out how do we achieve something?

00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:55,500
How do we influence others to help us along the way?

00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,869
Just like the contributor had the mentor help him along the way.

00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:04,699
And it's a really important thing to know how to lead yourself

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:10,830
because you really can't lead others

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,569
or an organization until you can lead yourself.

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,559
And that's because the more people you're responsible for

00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:21,199
the more goals you're responsible for

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,949
the more stressful it is.

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:30,029
And so if you can't stay calm and give people the calm direction that they need

00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,770
you're just not going to cut it as a leader.

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,439
And so because of all our individual efforts in open source

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,689
I'm going to focus a lot today on how to lead yourself.

00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:46,389
So what do leaders do?

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,699
So looking at this one contributor

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,069
you can see that leaders do many things

00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,360
and you can see that the contributor did many of these things as well.

00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,139
So you shape a vision.

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,360
You translate that vision into a clear strategy.

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,159
You get others to help you achieve it.

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,400
You focus on a measurable result

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,569
so you all know when you've achieved it together

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,099
and you foster innovation and learning throughout the process.

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,979
So you're constantly taking insights from all these people you brought together.

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,590
And as you're doing this, you're able to lead yourself.

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,319
You're able to really self-regulate your emotions.

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,729
Now, I'll talk some more about that.

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,339
And the contributor very much did this

00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:35,370
had a vision of contributing with the goal of one commit

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,870
and the strategy was to go get help, and he recruited a mentor to go do that.

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,940
And there was a goal.

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
It was one contribution.

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,810
And he did have a learning mindset, and he was able to do this again and again

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,829
and that's what made him be a top contributor.

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,279
And that's what leaders do.

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,079
And they need a lot of skills in order to do it.

00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:00,149
And if you look at this list from some Harvard Business Review research

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:07,879
you can see that the skills required range from inspiring and motivating others.

00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,019
Communication, collaboration.

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,009
You don't really see technical skills.

00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:18,079
To be a good leader does not mean you need to be a great coder or great mentor.

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,300
You just need to know how to work with others through influence.

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,720
And actually, more research shows that

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,820
two thirds of leadership depends on emotional intelligence.

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,310
That's really the skills that you need to be a leader.

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,329
And so if you want to lead yourself, if you want to lead others

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,710
you ultimately need to work on emotional intelligence.

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,529
So let's take a look at that.

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:51,339
So simply put, emotional intelligence is being able to understand your emotions

00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:57,779
in a moment, no matter how crazy that moment is, and the effect you have on others

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,750
and the ability to understand them and their emotional state and influence them

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,580
so that you all have a positive outcome together.

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,220
And emotional intelligence is a big thing to unpack

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,110
and there's many factors that make up emotional intelligence.

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,920
But the two key ones are self-awareness and self-regulation.

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,310
Self-awareness is really being in the now, being present

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,170
knowing how you're reacting to something.

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,790
And self-regulation is saying, like, "I know how I feel right now.

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,519
I'm going to adjust to have the best outcome possible."

00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,910
So a great example is you've just had a rough day.

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,930
You're trying to work with people.

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,580
Maybe it's through Slack, and something makes you so mad.

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,990
But you know.

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,389
You are self-aware.

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,560
This thing made me mad.

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:59,370
And you know you want to have a positive outcome, so you do what you need to do.

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,410
You self-regulate.

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,130
And then you choose your response.

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,180
That gives you a better outcome.

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe you end up having a "I'm not sure I understand this.

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,540
Why don't we go to a video call."

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,879
Talk it through.

00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,879
Right?

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,790
That takes emotional intelligence, and these are the key pillars.

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,149
And the thing is, if we can all get better at self-awareness, self-regulation

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:24,710
we can really grow our emotional intelligence.

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,120
And the nice thing is that you can grow emotional intelligence

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,470
much more than you can even your cognitive skills.

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,019
And the main way in which you improve emotional intelligence

00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,800
is through mindfulness.

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,860
And this is really about being present, living in the now.

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,990
And it's all about calming your nervous system

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,959
so that your emotions don't hijack your brain and take over

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,810
and make you send out that nasty email back at someone.

00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,120
When you're calm, you have more access to your logic brain

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,629
and you can better assess situations and decide how you're going to respond

00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:10,570
and how you're going to influence the situation for a better outcome.

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,970
And this can really include all kinds of approaches

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,209
so mindfulness could be meditation.

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,269
It could be yoga.

00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,459
It could be journaling.

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,110
And I know Google focuses on this a lot.

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,879
We have meditation rooms in our buildings

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,139
back when we used to be able to use our buildings.

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,430
And we also have a big initiative called Search Inside Yourself

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,459
which I encourage you to check out.

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,509
And I know for myself and others I talk to

00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,000
they think mindfulness sounds pretty hokey.

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,890
Why would I just sit down and do this to become a better leader?

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,470
Beyond the reasons I just gave, it's just a real change.

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,490
And I didn't know for myself if I would do it

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,630
but I did start a practice, and I certainly found that it helped me move through burnout.

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,149
I had more efficient thought processes

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,870
so if something came up, I was a little bit more strategic

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,440
because I was just creating more space to think instead of react.

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,439
I prioritized better and overall it just helped me

00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,829
move through some hard situations a lot better.

00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,649
And so I certainly encourage you to look into mindfulness

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:31,319
as a way to grow your emotional intelligence and therefore your leadership skills.

00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:35,079
And just to help kind of bring it home, I think Tara Brock

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,290
she's a Buddhist-based psychologist out of Washington, D.C. here in the US

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,050
she explains it best with this quote.

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,970
And it's that "Between stimulus and response, there is a space.

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,589
In that space is the opportunity to choose our response.

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,709
In our response lies our growth and our freedom."

00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,999
And so there's that space that we get to create

00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,579
and it's mindfulness that allows us to step back

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:08,240
and really create that space where we can collect ourselves and have a better response.

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,860
It's also mindfulness that helps us keep that space ready

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,360
so that we're not struggling all the time.

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,399
We're more resilient in the face of any kind of stimulus

00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,029
or conflict that's coming at us all day long.

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,220
And it's really important that we're resilient in open source

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,279
and that's because of the nature of the way we work.

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,230
We work with online communication and collaboration

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,550
using GitHub and Slack and Twitter

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,220
and our brains are actually not wired for online work.

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,709
We are designed for face-to-face interaction, reading each other's body cues.

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:51,710
It really does trigger the brain in a much different way.

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,690
And so when we do this online work together

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,149
it starts to trigger what's called a disinhibition effect.

00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,829
And there's a couple elements to it

00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,259
but two that I think are really important to call out

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,910
are when we have online communication

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,029
we have a lack of eye contact.

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,500
And when we have a lack of eye contact, that reduces empathy for each other.

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,610
We're just wired to read body language.

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,820
And emojis, they don't cut it.

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,189
They just don't help the brain process what's going on.

00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:27,240
And then the other thing working against us is that when we receive online communication

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,930
we almost always project a negative voice to it

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,740
or a more negative voice than what the person intended.

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,860
And it's just really unfortunate

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,990
but what we're doing is we're working in an environment where we aren't empathetic

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,110
and we're kind of assuming the worst from each other

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,029
which is probably why you're hearing

00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,240
all the time that you need to assume positive intent

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,869
but you just have to be self-aware of these types of things and assume positive intent

00:15:54,869 --> 00:16:01,160
and choose a better response than just that nasty email back.

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,939
So we're just being triggered all the time in open source.

00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,529
It does make it hard on many fronts

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,809
but if you have emotional intelligence, if you are resilient in this way

00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,990
you can really do a great job leading yourself through

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,399
all these kinds of new interactions you're going to have in open source.

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:27,680
So in addition to growing EI, emotional intelligence, with mindfulness

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,199
you also need some good strategies that are just ready to go

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,779
when you encounter some interesting interactions you'll have in open source.

00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,630
So that way, if something does trigger you

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,740
you reset and then you respond rather than react.

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,660
And there's a couple of protips for you on how to do this.

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,319
So for resetting, you can count to ten, if something's triggered you.

00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,410
You can take some deep, clearing breaths.

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,560
It calms the nervous system.

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,480
If you're a tea drinker, you can sip hot tea because it takes time to sip tea.

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,180
You don't want to burn yourself

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,520
and actually the act of taking in the tea is calming to the nervous system.

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,240
And then last but not least, you can always just take a walk around the block

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,220
collect your thoughts, come back to your computer, and decide how you want to respond.

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,070
And there's a lot of strategies for responding.

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,799
One way I like to use is "Yes, and ..."

00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,160
It comes from the improv world and somebody can say something to you

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
and maybe you don't necessarily agree, but you can say

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,340
"Yes, I hear you and here's another approach as well."

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,520
And what that does is it builds on ideas rather than saying no

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,100
and cutting that person off and then trying to convince them about your idea.

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,120
That gets you into more of a battle of ideas.

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,490
Another approach is the design approach: "I like, I wish, I wonder."

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,210
So if somebody sends you an idea, you could say, "I liked this proposal

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,520
I wish it had focused a little bit more on this other area that's interesting to me

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
and I wonder if you talk to Sally

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,620
if you two might be able to coordinate on filling in that area."

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,380
Again, it's not about cutting off ideas.

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,340
It's about designing a conversation and a path forward.

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,799
Some other things that are important are nonviolent communication skills

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,029
really understanding some key techniques

00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:43,049
for engaging for a positive outcome.

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:48,309
And there's books on this, and I highly recommend you check them out.

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:50,710
Also using active listening skills.

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,510
So a lot of times when we're interacting

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,860
we're so focused on our ideas and where we want to go next with the conversation

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,640
we're not always engaged in truly listening

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,730
and the person doesn't always know if they've been heard.

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,600
So before you take a conversation down a whole nother path

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,070
it's really important to use the active listening, asking questions like

00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,890
"What I heard you say was this.

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,890
Is that correct?"

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,260
And then you get aligned on the concepts they were trying to share

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,950
and then you can say, "Yes, that's great.

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,760
And what about this?"

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,820
And then lastly, when your interactions are going a little south

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,700
just ask the person to hop on a video call instead.

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,429
It's just so much more productive, and at least the video helps with the body language.

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,830
so these are some protips that you can use

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,940
for kind of leading yourself through really productive interactions in open source.

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,309
So phew!

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,809
We got through a lot pretty quickly.

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:57,159
So let me just do a quick recap of everything we've covered so far.

00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,110
You can lead from any position

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,360
and to do so, you just need to set a vision for yourself and ask for help.

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,730
People want to help you.

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,420
And remember, you can't lead others until you can lead yourself.

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,380
So focusing on self-leadership is really important

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,950
and it's going to take emotional intelligence to be a good leader.

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,970
And that's going to require you to start a mindfulness practice

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,360
because it's through mindfulness that you can grow

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,289
and strengthen your emotional intelligence.

00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,220
And then finally, as you're engaging with people, being mindful is helpful

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,799
but having strategies for engaging with others well is super important.

00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,130
So you want to practice your strategies to reset when something makes you upset.

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,419
And that way you know how to respond versus react.

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:54,000
And I hope that you will use these different techniques

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,700
because we really do need more leaders in open source and we are really excited

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,630
for you to get more involved and share your skills and talents with all of us.

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,409
So I hope that you will start being the leader that you need in open source

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:10,760
and that we all need.

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,260
So thank you so much for your time.

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,200
And if you have any questions
