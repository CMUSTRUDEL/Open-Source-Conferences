ABSTRACT

Tim, Founder of the Thousand Parsec project, will explore the universe of Free and Open Source computer games, drawing on his personal experience as a case study for successfully building and contributing
to an Open Source game project. Many areas will be covered including many which are of interest to people who don't normally play games! Discover the variety and creativity of some existing FOSS games, learn
about how commercial games are using FOSS and finally, *how to start your own game project*.

Speaker: Tim Ansell
Tim Ansell has given talks about FOSS gaming at a number of conferences and organised the Gaming Miniconf at Linux.conf.au 2007 and 2008.

Tim is an avid FOSS game developer, founding the Thousand Parsec project 7 years ago in 2001. Originally getting involved in FOSS development via a game project called WorldForge, he now believes that games are a very important part of the FOSS ecosystem.
