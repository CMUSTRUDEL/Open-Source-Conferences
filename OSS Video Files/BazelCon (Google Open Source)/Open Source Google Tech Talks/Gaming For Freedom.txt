ABSTRACT

Tim, Founder of the Thousand Parsec project, will explore the universe of Free and Open Source computer games, drawing on his personal experience as a case study for successfully building and contributing
to an Open Source game project. Many areas will be covered including many which are of interest to people who don't normally play games! Discover the variety and creativity of some existing FOSS games, learn
about how commercial games are using FOSS and finally, *how to start your own game project*.

Speaker: Tim Ansell
Tim Ansell has given talks about FOSS gaming at a number of conferences and organised the Gaming Miniconf at Linux.conf.au 2007 and 2008.

Tim is an avid FOSS game developer, founding the Thousand Parsec project 7 years ago in 2001. Originally getting involved in FOSS development via a game project called WorldForge, he now believes that games are a very important part of the FOSS ecosystem.

good evening ladies and gentlemen and

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,600
welcome to the open source developers at

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,760
Google speaker series our guest this

00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,380
evening is Tim Ansel and he will be

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,780
addressing us only topic of gaming for

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,030
freedom tim is a recent addition to the

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,680
Google engineering team and is also a

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,360
graduate of the University of Adelaide

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,280
where he studied both computer science

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:49,480
and philosophy should promise be an

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:52,900
interesting evening take away Tim hi I'm

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:58,900
Tim and i'll be talking about gaming and

00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:01,960
foss for the next 45 minutes or so so

00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,920
the first thing is I'm going to assume

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,740
you know what force is I'm not going to

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,930
get into any arguments about bf vs

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,970
freedom or which is the best known

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:18,820
source license or anything like that I

00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:21,400
assume that basically its Foss and I

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,560
also going to use a slightly different

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,510
definition of computer games than most

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,520
people generally think of in the media a

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,650
lot of people think of computer games as

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,770
just the type of games you like the

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:39,460
first person shooters the big hundred

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,920
million dollar budget games I'm going to

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:46,030
include every type of computer game from

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,710
solitaire all the way up to arm those

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:53,350
big titles so that's my definition of

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:59,350
computer game and that's what i'll be

00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:02,640
using when I say computer game so the

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,840
talks divided into three kind of primary

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,210
sections the first one I'm going to talk

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,599
about why you should all care about Foss

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,930
games whether or not you're a gamer I

00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,599
also talked about how Foss games are

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,290
already really well-established and how

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,409
they're going to continue to be better

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,159
and better and I'm also going to talk

00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:29,220
about um how to get involved and how to

00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:34,409
make your own games exist if you're

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,409
interested in producing your own games

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:45,030
so Who am I well I've worked on Foss

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,280
games for about seven or eight years now

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,489
I started when I was in high school

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,220
which is pretty normal for the force

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:57,410
game developers I started with a project

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:01,890
called world for CH which was the first

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:05,250
MMORPG project I'm source mo RPG project

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,370
and then I founded a project called

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,470
thousand parsec about six I think it's

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,079
going on seven years ago and I've been

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,840
running that ever since and because i

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:18,329
believe so strongly in games i've been

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,060
running a thing called the gaming mini

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,209
conf and which is a one-day event a part

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,549
of linux conf day you which is one of

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,280
the biggest southern hemisphere

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:33,090
open-source conferences and i did that

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,079
in 2007 and 2008 and generally I'm

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,090
trying to give these type of talks to

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:47,010
give people more information about false

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:50,630
games so yes that's me so yes I am an

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,120
Australian that's a picture of Australia

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:58,049
because you're Americans no I'm not

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,880
Austrian I'm an Australian you know

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,880
kangaroos amuse those type of things

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,510
this talk is also very under

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,660
construction I've only given this

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,959
specific talk once before so I'm going

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:18,690
to try and use lots of animations and

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:21,410
other eye candy to kind of hide all the

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,700
things which don't work quite here and

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,729
haven't actually been well thought out

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,729
so watch out for kind of falling slides

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,490
so the real question is why i'm giving

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,950
this talk and this kind of slide

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,160
summarizes all the reasons i'm giving

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:44,210
this talk and i'm going to go into more

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,190
detail over the next couple of slides

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,330
some of the just to summarize some of

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,539
the things is

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,780
there's a real negative inside the force

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:58,080
community that games is one area where

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,199
Foss can't compete and I just don't

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,590
think that's true the clothes nature of

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,569
gaming consoles and gaming preventing

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,300
people from moving windows there are two

00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:13,669
really important things that people seem

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,240
to forget and just that forces already

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:20,400
entered these markets and kind of

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,530
working really well and getting forward

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:29,430
and its people don't see this because a

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:33,300
lot of it is fairly secretive because of

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,930
the kind of high paced industry the

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,669
games industry is and lastly there's

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,340
just so many cool games out there and

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,310
unless you have been introduced to them

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:53,150
or know how to find them you can often

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:56,879
just not even see that they exist so I

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:59,909
personally think that force is the fire

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,930
games Foss games is the final frontier

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:06,779
for force we're doing pretty well well

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:11,099
we pretty much own the kind of embedded

00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:13,650
and server market with making good

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:23,460
penetration into just applications with

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:26,610
Firefox and openoffice and games is one

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:31,919
area where people haven't really been

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:34,949
concentrating and the reason people kind

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,199
of say force can't compete in games is

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,580
because of the large budgets it's a

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,729
high-stress industry moves very fast and

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,430
when you look back at the early 1990s

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,400
these are all exactly the same things

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:54,029
people are saying about linux and foss

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,300
they'll never be able to create office

00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:00,810
suite nobody will be able to create a

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,950
Linux that your grandma can use nobody

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:08,010
will be able to do this

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:10,500
apathy if you look at if you look at

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:15,090
foss now Firefox has twenty percent

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,220
market share in the world if even high

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,740
in some countries in some European

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,800
countries penetration of Firefox is

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,370
almost ninety percent mainly because

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,330
they can't get I in their own language

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:32,190
line-x revenue last year alone is

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:36,330
considered to be 35 billion dollars

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,160
which is ten percent of the software

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:43,130
industries earnings last year which I

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,830
dare anybody to say that is not

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,900
competing patchy runs seventy percent of

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:56,040
the internet these aren't small pieces

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:59,040
of software that arm don't do do trivial

00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,930
things these are full complicated pieces

00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:07,050
of software and games aren't that more

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,940
calm or complicated in games you don't

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,460
have to worry about the hundreds of

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,850
Microsoft file formats that you do when

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,410
you do an open source office suite games

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,240
you don't have to worry about the fact

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,980
that ninety percent of the web doesn't

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,210
comply with standards that you're doing

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:30,570
Firefox so there's no reason that you

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:32,729
couldn't compete in games so the

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,190
question often comes up when I'm at foss

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,550
conferences I'm talking about computer

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,670
games they say I'm not a gamer why

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,990
should I care I'm into force I'll run

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:48,240
line X I don't really care about games

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,980
there are lots of reasons that um you

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,360
should care and this is probably the

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,090
biggest one I don't know how many of you

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,850
have ever looked at the state of gaming

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:03,240
consoles but to develop for a gaming

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:06,720
console you have to go to the person who

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,410
produces the gaming console and request

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,120
permission and xbox and playstation have

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,450
things like mod chips and stuff like

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,740
that but to legitimately produce

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:23,220
a game for a console you have to get a

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,770
developer license and this is kind of

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,990
what media companies and people like

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,780
Microsoft would love to do to your PC

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,480
they would love to be able to say that

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,970
you can only run the programs that have

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,360
paid us a licensing fee on your computer

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:43,230
and I've done it in the case of gaming

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,560
consoles so this is why you should be

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:50,040
worried about open source games because

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,800
open source games are helping to fight

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,590
this problem because otherwise you can

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,410
only get this content on the closed

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:02,390
source platform so you're forced to use

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:05,430
it so this is why you should worry about

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,410
open source games because otherwise

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:15,450
you're going to end up with a computer

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:17,220
that you can't control the other thing

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,700
is if you can hear about linux on the

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,340
desktop a lot of people saying i don't

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,850
care about gains but i want to see linux

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,970
on everybody's computer and games online

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,240
XR acquired to see a high market

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:36,750
penetration of linux because at every

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,270
fuss conference i go to people put up

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:44,000
their hair i do a kind of survey and

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:46,830
they say okay who uses windows and a

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,580
kind of large majority put them up a

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:54,120
hand and i say who uses windows just for

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:57,540
computer games and like fifty percent of

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,610
the people in that audience still have

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,520
their hand up for that so it's

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,520
preventing a large majority of people

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:11,490
who would otherwise be completely false

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:13,620
on their desktop from moving to that so

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,020
that's why if you care about line it's

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,790
on the desktop you should care about arm

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,790
gains on line x

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:29,790
um so the thing this might seem all like

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,420
doom and gloom because like the closed

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,940
source nature of consoles and that type

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,660
of thing but force is actually already

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:45,270
going really well if you look at the mod

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:49,560
chips and the open-source homebrew stuff

00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:51,330
where you could easily add in things to

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,450
the gaming consoles there are hundreds

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:59,000
of phos games that you can access their

00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:07,170
emulators there are full blowing games

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,810
so we're actually winning and the great

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,000
thing about force is that it grows at an

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,790
exponential rate it works really well on

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,490
the network effect the more open source

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,040
games there are the easier it is to make

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,589
a new open source game which means that

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,810
there are more open source games which

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:28,470
anybody can see is kind of a feedback

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:34,440
loop which is going to make making open

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:36,899
source games much better and if you look

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,990
at the history of computer games almost

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,230
all the original computer games were

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,020
open source things like space war which

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:50,550
is often considered one of the well if

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:54,320
not the first multiplayer game to exist

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:59,040
on computers was totally open source

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,680
dungeon which is one of the first text

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:08,010
based computer games that consumed many

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:11,310
people's colleges back in the 1980s arm

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:15,120
was open while seven I don't know when

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,740
it was produced well that's kind of

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,470
before I was born so um that was an open

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,880
source game and was ported to many

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:30,360
mainframe platforms mud which is kind of

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:33,089
spawned off a whole swath of tech space

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,760
multiplayer games was an open source

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:40,100
game the whole kind of mud

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:44,280
schmuck and other multiplayer user games

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:47,100
text based user games all kind of have a

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:55,460
history from this and a majority of them

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:58,170
false based and the other thing is that

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,800
commercial games are already using false

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:04,200
this is kind of something that um people

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,050
often don't realize that all the

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,160
commercial games out there today use

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:14,160
some type of force the first line listed

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,540
there are games which have used a force

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,520
components directly in their software

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,340
things like Python are very common

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,840
pythons and M source language and they

00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,980
embed it because they can get access to

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,560
developer resources and makes their

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:38,070
pipeline much quicker things like in the

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,940
handheld region things like lure and SQL

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,770
Lite are some of the smallest and

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,250
highest quality libraries that you can

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,490
get for the size they are so they used

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,660
in hundreds of games which need

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:57,720
scripting or an SQL type database and

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:00,690
the other thing is stable stability

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,620
really matters when you're running a

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:09,150
game if a game goes down you get angry

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:13,370
posts on your forums like seconds after

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:15,570
it goes down so a large majority of

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,990
computer game companies who run things

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,420
like online services do it on things

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,710
like Linux and FreeBSD because they can

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,860
get the stability that they matter and

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:31,290
they're also using force internally

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,080
things like subversion are very common

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,830
in especially the Australian games

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,380
industry which is a little bit low lower

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:44,640
margin so they can't afford perfect

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:48,570
things like perforce licenses and a lot

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,500
of them use subversion for media things

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,510
like

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,000
when you're doing media development in

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:57,780
your game you have a media repository

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,650
and there's no other revision control

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:04,680
system which can handle the quantity of

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:10,080
data they have they have like 200 and

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:13,380
300 gigabytes worth of binary data so

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:17,360
they using force internally if you look

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:24,200
at the Sony Playstation it uses a GCC

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:26,670
derivative for all their compilers so

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,160
force it's already been used in

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:33,120
commercial games and it's getting

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,070
increasingly more on there are even

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,230
large middleware companies which are

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,100
considering opening source their

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,310
middleware because they make money from

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:49,850
basically providing the middleware to

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:51,690
companies as a kind of service so

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,940
releasing their middleware would

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,700
automatically produce a whole bunch of

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,710
coders who would work on their middle we

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,970
improve it and also get the skills they

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:08,689
need to develop the next generation of

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:08,689
commercial computer games this is not a

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,600
not a pipe dream it is happening id

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:20,430
Software always releases their previous

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:29,060
game engine under open source there's a

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:34,620
really huge emulator and that type of

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:41,490
playing old games again which is growing

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:44,370
really well so now I'm just going to go

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,910
through kind of some proof of what I've

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:54,480
been saying um there are four games out

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:58,890
there which are in ative and their first

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,929
games out there which do have commercial

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,299
quality polish a lot of people say our

00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:06,090
force games are just like

00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:08,279
I don't know bubble bobble your casual

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:12,210
game their first person shooters out

00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:15,919
there which have as much polish as the

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:27,570
commercial open source the commercial

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:29,960
first-person shooter games so west north

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,639
is a good example of a polished game

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,389
it's kind of the heroes of might and

00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:40,470
magic and got things like a puzzle game

00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:43,649
like fish phillips or nygma chromium

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:47,580
your top down shooter world a pad man

00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:50,820
and warsaw which Warsaw is actually a

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:54,179
great story because it's become a very

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:59,519
strong competitive computer game it's

00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:01,830
actually being in eSports tournaments

00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,019
and it has a very strong following

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,779
because the type of game they wanted to

00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:09,570
make it's very suited for eSports

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,309
there's lots of trick jumping and stuff

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,779
like this which actually makes it quite

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:17,850
a good game to demonstrate we're going

00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,730
to put the slides up on the web so if

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,519
you need want to like find out more

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,159
about these games you'll be able to

00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,049
download them and click on the links I'm

00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,600
not going to spend too much time on this

00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:33,779
section because um it will get out of

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,330
date if you watch this video a year from

00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,109
now the type of games that out there

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:42,529
will change drastically there's some

00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:47,940
really quite good party games out there

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:52,489
things like frets on fire stepmania that

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:55,909
it better or as good if not better than

00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:58,529
some of the commercial counterparts

00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:04,429
stepmania is actually used in commercial

00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:06,899
arcade games that you go to like a a

00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:10,440
coin-operated arcade you put your money

00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:16,230
in you can actually play a fost game in

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,400
a commercial game faas games also vary

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,860
in ative

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,590
liquid wars is a very hard game to

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:27,520
explain but it's not like anything else

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:31,150
that's out there globul a Shinto is a

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,640
real-time strategy game that plays very

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,740
differently to how you'd normally play

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,790
real time strategy game you don't get to

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:41,880
control your units directly this is a

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:47,230
puzzle game that was written in

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,180
originally in a week and you have to

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,890
water your plants and the way you do

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,500
that is by placing these bricks which

00:20:50,890 --> 00:21:00,270
cool one evaporates team this is another

00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,710
very inert of hard core strategy game

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:05,890
it's very hard so I've never got past

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,160
the second level but you can do things

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,560
like change the arm shield strength and

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,240
where you want to target the ship and

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:18,370
stuff like that so these are the places

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,200
you really want to pay attention to

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,110
because these are where you can find

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,200
more games if you look at fresh meat

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:31,540
which is like a very large database of

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:37,720
UNIX and open source game of software

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:41,380
there 2918 games projects on there the

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:45,310
Linux gain tome has a massive amount of

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:48,160
very good games wikipedian Lee has lots

00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,800
of them and serve as free gamer that

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,230
kind of if you want to watch new and

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,840
upcoming games is a great place to see

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,930
their blog post find out what's

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,930
happening

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,020
so now I'm going to talk about thousand

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:14,200
party because if it it's the game I've

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,730
had most involvement with and the game

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:23,800
that i can give you the most information

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:28,740
about and this is just the nice intro

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,740
movie we have for the game

00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:42,159
so just quickly thousand parsec is both

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:45,940
a framework for building turn-based

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:49,289
empire building games and it's a bunch

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:55,409
of playable games that use the framework

00:22:49,289 --> 00:23:00,100
it works on mac linux and windows and

00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:02,950
the way it works is that's kind of that

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,230
any client connect to any server so a

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:11,559
server could be running a kind of start

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:13,299
wars or stop star trek rule set and you

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:18,240
can use the same client to connect to

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:21,429
either downloads all the rules and

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,860
configures itself so that you can play

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:29,820
that type of game it's kind of what I

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,820
would call the web of 4x strategy games

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:39,279
so thousand partake has been growing

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:42,340
very rapidly in the recent years but it

00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,710
took a very long time to get started if

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:49,330
you look at this graph here for almost

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,850
up until somewhere around 2003-2004

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,100
there wasn't much activity and you can

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,960
see now like most open source projects

00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:00,070
once you kind of get over this hump

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,749
we've grown quite massively and this is

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,509
like a download history and our web

00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:06,809
traffic and that's pretty normal for an

00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:10,179
open source game takes quite a long time

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:14,889
before it gets noticed before people

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:19,629
start playing it and being interested in

00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:23,350
it before a project takes off and we

00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:27,029
have about 150 k lines of code and total

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:30,580
of which about fifty percent is in C++

00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:33,789
thirty percent is in Python and the rest

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:38,190
is in kind of Java and a whole bunch of

00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:41,679
other languages we're fairly

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:45,009
cross-language we have support for C++

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,990
Python and Java and we have people

00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,990
writing clients in those languages

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,320
so what helped us grow most in the

00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:59,080
recent years is the google Summer of

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,250
Code last year was our first year that

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,480
we joined summer of code and we had four

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:13,390
students as part of the Summer of Code

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:16,030
the one another students did a massive

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,640
amount of work on making it easier to

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,370
make a new rule set if you want to make

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,840
a star wars game it's much easier now he

00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,929
wrote an integrated development

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,929
environment for it and we've started

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:32,559
like our target audience being games is

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:35,290
pretty much young people although all

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,960
people do play older people do play lots

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:40,690
of computer games students tend to have

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,790
much more time on their hands when

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:46,540
they're procrastinating for exams so

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:48,910
we've started reaching out to students

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,830
to help our development and if you're

00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,350
interested in finding out more about how

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:58,540
we're doing that I did a podcast with

00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:01,840
Leslie Hawthorne who is the the host of

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,880
this talk and you'll be up shortly after

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,830
this talk and you can listen about some

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,830
of them more experiences and some record

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:21,660
so last year we won student committed 20

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:25,000
thousand lines of code in three months

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,220
this year we have eight students and in

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,260
the two weeks since summer eco started

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:34,690
we've already had two over two hundred

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:38,380
commits so I guess the next section is

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:41,530
kind of to explain how we kind of grew

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:44,640
this project because it's okay saying

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:48,040
okay here's our project here where it at

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:55,270
what you don't see is how we got to

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:56,530
where we are oh and the most recent

00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,390
really cool thing that one of the

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,750
students is doing is this is what our

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:05,830
client looks currently it's very windows

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:11,020
3.1 very utilitarian it does work very

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:13,390
well but it's not very pretty the

00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:16,930
student is using our library is to

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,790
develop a 3d client and this is the only

00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:23,160
been working at two weeks and this is

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:26,290
what is produced so far a very 3d

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,720
environment that looks like much more

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,550
like a commercial game and we hope by

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,660
the end of the summer we'll have

00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:36,940
something that looks as good if not

00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:42,750
better than some of the current games

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:45,550
like sins of a solar empire or like

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,220
Supreme Commander and he's actually

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:51,430
leveraging the same client libraries and

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:59,770
stuff that support the kind of windows

00:27:51,430 --> 00:28:04,150
3.11 and just before I move on we really

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:06,580
need people to help us play test we've

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,430
got coders we've got people doing

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,370
packaging we really need people to just

00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:15,640
download and try the game and then tell

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:20,980
us what isn't fun about it or what

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,920
doesn't work so please come and help us

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,169
play the client is one click install in

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,749
Windows and Mac and we have dead

00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:35,470
herbs forearm you bun to and debian on

00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:37,359
line x we have e builds for gen 2 and so

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:43,179
there's some guys working on rpms for

00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:45,850
all our systems so often when people say

00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:49,239
i want to make a game this is the

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:52,480
general kind of post oh my god let's

00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:56,759
make a really cool MMORPG and this is

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,759
the not the best way to make your game

00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:07,629
so we do need you to help contributor

00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:13,119
for the reasons I mentioned in the first

00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:15,519
part it's also really fun to do um you

00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:21,549
get to make games that work the way you

00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:24,519
want to I'm not a person who's strong in

00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:27,039
the dexterity I don't play first-person

00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,799
shooter games very much because it just

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,679
it's a click fest I'm not I'm in too

00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:35,470
much more strategy games so that's what

00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,139
thousand parsec is it's a very strong

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,320
strategy game if you're into the first

00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:44,830
person shooting trick jumping you need a

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,539
millisecond response time you can make

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:51,639
the game that way you don't have to

00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:53,919
pander to the common denominator that a

00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:56,859
lot of game companies have to do to sell

00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,149
their hundred million units if you have

00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:02,559
an itch community of 10,000 gamers and

00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:09,759
around the world you can make the game

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:13,330
that they want to play so my first tip

00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:17,590
for making a game is you want to release

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:21,609
as early as possible the first time you

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:24,879
have something that compiles and does

00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:27,399
something non trivial this is a lot of

00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:30,340
these apply to foss projects in general

00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:33,249
but games it's particularly important

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,830
because nobody will play a game unless

00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:39,520
they can actually compile and use it a

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:45,250
lot of games projects die

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:50,680
was nobody sat down and released it so

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:54,040
that's my first tip my second tip is

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,440
that release often are a majority of

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,170
people who will play your game won't

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:05,710
check out this subversion repository

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:08,640
they won't download the hundred

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,350
dependencies that you want so release a

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,690
candidate often that they can play with

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:18,220
even if it isn't a stable people are

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:23,070
much more likely to test a game and play

00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:27,490
it if they can get access to it easily

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:29,350
which leads into my next point you

00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,720
really do need to make it easy to

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,650
install thousand parsecs into a

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:38,890
one-click install for windows it's a

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:40,870
one-click install for Mac online it's a

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,990
little bit harder but we're hoping to

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:46,060
get into the distributions and we're

00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:50,110
trying to release a like on a six

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:56,110
monthly cycle now so it gives people the

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:59,440
opportunity to actually play what we're

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:01,480
developing and this is a vital

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,940
importance because if you look at we

00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,240
spent two years rewriting our primary

00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:11,500
client and if you look at the graph the

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:14,080
moment we released 0.30 arm which is the

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,590
latest version of our client we had a

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,690
massive spike in our lease and every

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,600
time of relief done another release

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:26,830
after that we've had a massive spike in

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,980
downloads so releasing early make it

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:34,470
easier to download releasing off and all

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:38,140
tips to building your gaming community

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:44,170
and the other thing is that you need to

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:46,120
promote yourself projects don't continue

00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,570
if they don't have other people working

00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,070
on them you need to have go out and tell

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,360
people that you're actually doing this

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:57,860
cool thing

00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,500
that's a lot what I try and do with in a

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:04,690
lot of context I'd go out there and I

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,559
just pick 10 examples 20 examples and

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:11,630
promote them so that you can you can see

00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:15,770
what's out there lots of people don't

00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:17,900
realize the quality of the games out

00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,740
there they don't realize that they can

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:24,200
get first-person shooter games for free

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:30,950
that work on their windows or linux or

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:33,490
mac another excuse often here is that I

00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,990
don't have the time to develop a game

00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:39,169
when you look at thousand parsecs I've

00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,640
spent seven years work on that imposter

00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:43,130
and people just look at that and go

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,220
you're crazy i would never stick with

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:49,370
something for seven years but you don't

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:52,040
have to there are plenty of open source

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:55,160
games that came about from these

00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:59,120
competitions there's a thing called pi

00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:02,299
week where the each time it runs you

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,470
have to develop a complete runnable game

00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:09,980
in a week that's where a lot of these

00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:14,330
really infinitive games come from I'm

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:16,220
like that Nellie's garden I believe came

00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,679
out of one of these competitions I'm not

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,470
exactly sure which one but I know it

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:26,179
came out of one of these and that game

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:28,340
is really interesting to play there's if

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:32,240
you don't have seven days maybe you just

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:36,139
want to spend a weekend the Lum ludum

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,960
dare um gaming competition is a great

00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:42,109
way to get into it and you don't have to

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,070
have much in were in the terms of

00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:49,490
experience to do this things like Python

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:52,490
and pygame have meant that a person

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:54,740
who's got a reasonable level of Python

00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:59,390
can start doing game development in

00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:01,400
under an hour pi day is kind of the

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:04,130
newest one and only ones for 24 hours

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,500
people have to make a complete game in

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,140
24 hours and people do

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,140
and its really I mean even if you don't

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,960
end up doing it I recommend checking out

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,390
these because there's a lot of really

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,040
cool interesting stuff and the best ones

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,590
always seem to continue after the

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:30,890
conference anyway um after the

00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:34,340
competition anyway so python is really

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:37,220
the key to writing any open source game

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:42,440
quickly there people complained that

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:45,110
python is slow but it's not if you do it

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,710
right for the simple reason that all

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:51,800
your libraries are written in C++ things

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,620
like Eau de or your 3d engine do all the

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,840
heavy lifting and see puss-puss you just

00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,700
write the game that you want to write

00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:04,940
not caring about the 3d matrix that has

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:07,310
to transform the camera angles and stuff

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,520
like this which makes it very quick to

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:13,340
throw together a game I highly recommend

00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,890
checking out Python for go there are

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:19,340
lots of stuff in the languages like Java

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,950
and C++ I haven't had much experience

00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:27,770
with them and from looking at things

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:31,760
like the 24 hour programming game

00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:33,710
competition there's hardly any games

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:41,650
written in other languages just because

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:44,000
it takes too long so if you're using

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:49,670
Python I recommend that you check out

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:54,730
piglet it's a very nice gaming engine

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:58,550
that makes it very easy to write again

00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:01,490
the most impressive talk I've ever seen

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:05,240
was the guy by the two guys who wrote

00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:09,890
this they wrote a clone of space

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:12,610
invaders in a talk they were giving a 45

00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:15,020
minute talk they will had one guy

00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,090
explaining what the other guy was doing

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:21,760
and the other guy just SAT there and

00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:25,099
tightened and created space invaders

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,299
45 minutes it's up on the web if you

00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,130
don't believe me you don't believe

00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:31,059
that's actually occurred there's a video

00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:34,130
over on google video just search for

00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:36,109
piglet he'll be the first or second

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,369
video there and you can watch them

00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:45,349
literally create a game before your eyes

00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:48,019
it was really really impressive if you

00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:50,900
don't the piglet requires opengl

00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:52,579
hardware if you're more into the 2d

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,349
games or you want to talk something like

00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:58,069
the old pc have a look at something like

00:37:54,349 --> 00:38:01,730
pie game pie game I'm came before piglet

00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:07,130
it's a bit older and is stl but it's a

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:13,369
great way to write a quick 2d scrolling

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:15,339
game or a like it's not for your first

00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:19,880
person shooters it's for your kind of

00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:23,779
older games but it's really fun to do

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,700
you can do plenty of different things

00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:29,420
and if you go to their website you can

00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,609
see what various people can do and it's

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,980
really amazing and i highly suggest you

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:40,960
check it out if you're into that type of

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:46,490
game if you're into 3d there are also

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:49,339
many ways that you can leverage over

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,420
source projects that already exist you

00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:56,630
don't have to write your own 3d game ah

00:38:52,420 --> 00:39:01,160
3d engine to do a game things like Olga

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:04,759
3d its of that's what our new client

00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:08,809
with all those 3d graphics is written in

00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:11,210
it's written on top of ogre 3d and that

00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:13,369
guy had has only had about two weeks

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:17,920
worth of development time to put

00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:23,299
together that very specky looking arm

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:26,359
game things like crystal space also very

00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:30,200
good at doing computer games they also

00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:32,450
have like ogres just a rendering engine

00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,680
where's crystal space has all your like

00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,800
network

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,050
your physics it means you can put

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,570
together again very very quickly and

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:47,090
then there's things like ear Lich and

00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:53,840
nebula device again they have different

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:56,660
targets but they do provide full support

00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,330
for wide variety of things I even

00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,790
believe that nebula device has been used

00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:04,550
in a number of smaller commercial games

00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:08,480
in Europe it was released by a

00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:12,880
commercial game company who was using

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:17,870
their engine to do commercial games so

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:23,720
you can do really advanced stuff with

00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:28,220
these things so that's kind of the end

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:31,340
of my presentation I'm happy to take

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:33,800
questions from anybody and or just stand

00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:40,010
around discuss your favorite force games

00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:41,900
or whatever the audience wants questions

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,940
there's a mic behind you if you want to

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,310
ask a question can you stand up at it

00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,360
either I can repeat the question if it's

00:40:46,310 --> 00:41:06,590
just short questions come on don't be

00:40:50,360 --> 00:41:16,600
scared um I have heard about I don't

00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:18,500
know its name yep so um there's a game

00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,450
according to this guy down the front

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,460
called ultra star which is a clone of

00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,760
singstar I know there's at least a

00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:28,460
couple of games which do very similar

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,130
things to sing star I don't know how

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,130
good it is but yeah

00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:48,390
yeah yep playstation xbox wii yeah what

00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,699
would it take to get open source to the

00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:55,619
gaming console is it monetizable would

00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:59,549
it ever happen the question was i

00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:03,569
mentioned that game consoles are closed

00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:05,729
at the moment and how whether or not you

00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:08,400
could get own sauce on these and how you

00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:16,430
might go about monetizing it and stuff

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:19,920
like that the biggest blocker to the

00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:26,309
open source on the console is the semi

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:29,219
freak it's that the microsoft then that

00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:31,380
we have started producing their kits

00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:34,559
where you can create your own game and

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,089
you go through a QA process and then if

00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,930
they like your game they'll publish it

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:41,670
on there like xbox live network the

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,239
thing about using these is that you can

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:49,979
only do it on their console and they

00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:52,949
have fairly draconian in what you can do

00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:55,619
if you want to make a satire game about

00:42:52,949 --> 00:43:00,529
something that quite vested in they

00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:00,529
won't let you do there and they won't

00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:07,829
they basically get a lot of rights you

00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:10,859
want otherwise give away so that's the

00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:15,359
biggest barrier to open source because

00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:19,079
it kind of tempts people that you can

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,880
write your own games for xbox but you

00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,869
don't get you can't write an open source

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,799
game for xbox at the moment the great

00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,440
thing that's happening on the

00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:31,440
playstation 3 at the moment is that sony

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,249
have come out and said they support

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,880
running linux on their PlayStation 3

00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:42,239
they don't give you access to the 3d

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,459
accelerator on the PlayStation 3 so

00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:48,880
you've only got access to kind of the

00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:50,710
hard drive and the like cell processor

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,049
but there's some pretty cool things you

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:57,460
can do even with that limited platform

00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:59,769
and I kind of I hope it's so nice

00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,099
tarting to see the light that there are

00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:06,819
a lot of you can leverage a lot of this

00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:10,059
to let people produce games for your

00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:12,789
console which lets you sell a sell more

00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:16,740
consoles and once you sell more consoles

00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:16,740
you can sell more commercial games and

00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:24,579
how you monetize it is a question I

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:27,220
don't really know but I think there are

00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,920
a lot of games which you could

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,500
distribute in terms of a client-server

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,230
model where the client and the server

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:39,160
both dopant sauce but the content on the

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:42,339
server is closed so things like the

00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:45,609
quests that our server has or have the

00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:49,839
media like the graphics and stuff like

00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:53,380
that the game has and then that's what

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:56,619
draws people to you subscribe to a

00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:59,529
service rather than selling a piece of

00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:03,579
software and I think there's a lot of

00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:06,599
potential in the MMORPG kind of market

00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:09,009
and anything among those type of lines

00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:12,460
it does mean somebody else would come

00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:14,589
along and set up a new MMORPG with a

00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,509
whole bunch of different storylines but

00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:18,789
competition is healthy and you means

00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:22,210
you'll get more interesting games

00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:25,390
because the barrier to entry is lower if

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,880
you tomorrow turn around the and decide

00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:31,509
that you have this really cool idea for

00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:35,740
an MMORPG if the Middle where is already

00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:39,730
there you can put together for probably

00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:42,880
fifty thousand dollars in terms of cost

00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,609
which makes a much lower bad entry which

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,089
means we get lots more games at the

00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:53,230
moment games are costing hundred million

00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:56,740
dollars they're on the same price as

00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:59,400
like Hollywood which means that to make

00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,589
money off them you have to sell a

00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,860
hundred million units which means that

00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:08,470
you

00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:10,780
have to sell your game to everyone you

00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,430
can't sell it to a niche market because

00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,660
there aren't a hundred million people in

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:18,010
that niche market so I think once we

00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,880
start seeing them sorts take over that

00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:24,550
area providing you the tools to produce

00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:31,680
content there's a lot of interesting

00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:31,680
things that could happen in the air yeah

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:45,690
I do think so the question was the arm

00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:48,970
that with open source the gameplay is

00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:51,040
the advantage do you ever think that the

00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:55,150
open source will catch up in that eye

00:46:51,040 --> 00:47:00,090
candy air and I think yes it will it

00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:02,950
might take a well it will take a while I

00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,790
think people said the same thing in

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:09,940
terms of eye candy on the desktop in

00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:14,500
things like 3d desktops and compositing

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:19,000
and Linus has shown that it can lead the

00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:22,510
way in that area it had some of the

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,260
first true compositing long before Vista

00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:31,960
was released and it still does lots of

00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:35,140
effects that you can't do on vista or

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,080
mad cause I think that we're Foss can

00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:42,040
really go forward is in kind of

00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:45,450
generated content once you get to a

00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,970
certain level of detail having an artist

00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:51,790
craft by hand no longer becomes feasible

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:55,210
because there's just too much to look at

00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:57,850
so you start having computers assist the

00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,680
artist in creating the model by doing

00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,360
things like motion capture and stuff

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,140
like that and the price of all these

00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:07,480
things is really dropping I can purchase

00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:10,320
a high-speed camera for ten thousand

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,210
dollars now which is good enough to do a

00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,570
variety of motion capture type things

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:19,180
and that's dropping

00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:21,580
considerably sony released a

00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:26,770
high-definition camera on the market

00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:29,200
recently which used to be costs like a

00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:32,470
thousand dollars and that's now like two

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,590
hundred dollars which is once these

00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:37,990
tools become available and once the foss

00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,550
community starts using them i think it

00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:43,450
will kind of start having this network

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:46,930
effect once you have this person solving

00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:49,210
how to do excuse me I'm skeletal

00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,490
animation and this person figuring out

00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,650
how to defer in real time you then

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,180
combine the two which you can't do in a

00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,640
commercial setting because you have to

00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,880
pay him some money because he developed

00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:02,980
the fur thing and once we start hitting

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,150
that the network effect really kicks in

00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:13,900
and I candy will have to be better on

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:16,540
foss because of that um you basically

00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:20,440
put like a single color on various

00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:23,860
locations on your body and then yes in

00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,830
two cameras to do like more than simple

00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,570
stuff but yeah you put the things on and

00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:33,040
then the person moves and then you map

00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:36,250
it to your skeleton in a character I'm

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,830
not an expert on motion capture and it

00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:43,240
does remind me of a fost library though

00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:49,570
called lib cal.3d which was one of the

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:53,050
first libraries ever to do skeletal 3d

00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:56,140
animation combinar combining so like

00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:58,420
when a person's walking they do a motion

00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,820
capture of somebody walking and emotion

00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,740
capture somebody running but people

00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,260
don't like when moving around in games

00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:08,380
they don't move but only two speeds they

00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:12,130
move at halfway between this so you

00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,990
can't have a artist generate a hundred

00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:16,120
different animations of somebody moving

00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,070
at different speeds so this technology

00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,250
was developed which allowed you to blend

00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:26,220
the two animations and from my

00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:30,099
understanding lib cal.3d was the first

00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:32,470
library to do that fairly well

00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:36,069
and it was actually you for a long time

00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:38,259
it was used in commercial games for this

00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:41,019
because there was nothing else out there

00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:45,519
that was affordable and did it as well

00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:51,339
so that's an example of where Foss works

00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:53,349
really well so yeah I think we I think

00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:56,349
the network effect means that force

00:50:53,349 --> 00:51:10,150
winds full stop it just might take a

00:50:56,349 --> 00:51:14,109
while to get there to be able to modify

00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:18,249
the game but then take a network game if

00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:20,859
somebody modifies its client to see

00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:23,529
through walls so roles to a change the

00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:29,019
behavior and everything it's infinitely

00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:31,569
easier to do it with so the question was

00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:33,789
what about cheating you've got the

00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:39,009
source code you can modify it to do what

00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:43,450
you want so hence arm you can cheat you

00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:45,809
can do things like remove walls um this

00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:49,089
is the classic argument and I think

00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:52,229
people have already proven that security

00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:54,819
through obscurity doesn't work anyway so

00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:57,489
the thing games have for it is that

00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:59,799
games tend to only be around for a

00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:02,319
couple of years so that there's not

00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:05,769
enough time for people to figure out

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:08,430
what's happening I think Foss is going

00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:12,489
to have to take a different route and

00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:16,869
develop games we're doing that type of

00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:18,489
thing isn't an advantage and other

00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:20,979
things you can do like you could have a

00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:23,680
server for first person shooter game

00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:25,900
which only tells you your location so if

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,549
you removed all the walls you can't see

00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,339
anybody else because the server's not

00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:34,210
giving you that information in real-time

00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:35,680
strategy games the way you you stop

00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,569
people cheating is by doing a

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,700
simultaneous simulation you record what

00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:41,349
people's import is and then you play it

00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,020
back on both the other person's computer

00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:46,840
so if this code isn't identical to this

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,500
computer it slowly diverges and then you

00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:54,310
get um different outcomes and it knows

00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:56,470
somebody's not being correct this is how

00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,230
commercial games even do real-time

00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:01,600
strategy games because it much allows

00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:07,060
much lower latency and means you don't

00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:09,610
have to transmit so much information so

00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:12,640
yeah there are ways around this and I'm

00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:15,940
actually looking into in my spare time a

00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:21,280
way to do achieve manan open source

00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:25,390
environment without with being able to

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:28,750
modify the client so in a lot of

00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:32,470
computer games you can when you kill

00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:34,930
somebody a hundred what kill enemies a

00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:36,910
hundred times you get a gold star or

00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:39,430
something like this which appears on

00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:41,350
your profile on a website somewhere that

00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:43,990
says this guy is really cool he has

00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:46,600
killed a hundred people or he solved a

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,870
hundred puzzles or he's done something

00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,380
like this and what I'm really interested

00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:55,270
in is trying to figure out how because

00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:58,750
the person's can look inside the code

00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:00,760
they just go on for hundreds even Saul I

00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:03,610
do is post this request to the server

00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,400
and it posts the request to the server

00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:08,860
and he gets a hundred achievements so

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,590
how do you solve this problem and I

00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:18,250
think I may have figured out a way using

00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:21,700
a kind of um PGP type system of a sphere

00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:23,410
of trust like where you don't upload

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,540
your own achievements you upload

00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,430
achievements of others so when you see

00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,320
somebody do a headshot you upload the

00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:32,650
fact that this person has done a

00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:35,260
headshot and then you can use this that

00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:37,390
you only upload information for people

00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,310
you trust and they're Devils in the

00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,680
details but I think I've got a way to

00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:44,590
solve this and it will be released in

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,650
open source so that any open source game

00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:54,280
can then at these feature and they'll be

00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:56,940
able to have this type of achievements

00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,000
in their games which is

00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:06,420
clients in one nearly 50 each other yes

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:11,790
but but it does help because if you have

00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:14,190
enough people the Cheetahs will come

00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:17,069
glom rate in a part of a network which

00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:18,839
nobody else trusts so you've got a chain

00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:23,609
of trust do you track this achievement

00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:25,500
is determined on arm the fact that you

00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:27,569
trust him who trust him who trust him

00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,480
and it is the same type of network of

00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:34,020
trust type of thing I haven't worked out

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,630
the details it might not work but I'm

00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:39,690
going to give it a try with in the next

00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,220
six months I'll be interested to see

00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,680
what happens even if it's a failed

00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:47,640
experiment I don't have much knowledge

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:51,869
of how country how the web of trust

00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:54,750
works in pgp so I'm going to learn lots

00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:57,270
about that and the great thing is pgp is

00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:59,760
open source so I can reuse a lot of that

00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:03,089
which means my barrier to entry into

00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,400
cryptography is lower than somebody who

00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:09,349
has the doors and commercial setting

00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,349
which is what I really love about false

00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:16,170
yeah where's your picture come from um I

00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:22,920
just recently started here at Google

00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:25,410
I've been here for two weeks I've been

00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,560
working on thousand parsec for seven

00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:31,950
years and I started that back in uni or

00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:34,829
is it high school oh that's only free

00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:38,849
time I've never been paid to work on

00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:44,180
open source games that's kind of what I

00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:51,630
hope to do one day in the future for now

00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:55,410
not yes and I'm not in the kind of hole

00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:59,220
starving person I kind of like my food

00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:02,849
so yes I'll work continue to work in

00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:06,780
other areas until I can solve that

00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:09,450
problem but it is happening people are

00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,770
at least three people I know who start

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,560
off and forth now we're

00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:18,930
in the commercial games industry doing

00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:21,600
various foster so I yeah it it's

00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:25,710
happening and I think it's an exciting

00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:30,180
time because we're kind of back in the

00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:32,100
equivalent to the kind of 1995 in terms

00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,340
of line it's on the desktop type thing

00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,810
so we're still growing and we I think

00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:40,920
there's lots of really cool things

00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:42,720
happening and I think like lights and

00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:47,280
desktop is finally starting to come true

00:57:42,720 --> 00:58:01,020
I think from now on that we'll we'll see

00:57:47,280 --> 00:58:03,570
some interesting things so yes yeah a

00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,700
lot of game series like to keep it quiet

00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:09,030
because they think of it as a

00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:12,300
competitive advantage oh sorry the

00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,940
question was are there any large game

00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:21,170
studios contributing the force in the

00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:23,040
same way the kind of IBM and other large

00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:26,700
industry industry things are

00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:30,180
contributing false and I think people

00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:33,000
are our games still have this kind of

00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:35,910
idea that they can hide things through

00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,040
secure obscurity and they don't like to

00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:40,590
advertise the fact that all our

00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,800
infrastructure runs on linux and

00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:46,760
subversion and we're not paying the X

00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:53,790
thousands of dollars to perforce so

00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:56,670
that's money we get to keep and there's

00:58:53,790 --> 00:59:02,220
lots of kind of and the high churn in

00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:04,470
the games industry most games companies

00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,110
don't last very long which means that

00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:15,570
people tend to move don't have the time

00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:18,840
to establish this I know the a lot of

00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:24,069
gaming universities have started to

00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:26,400
establish a lot of like using

00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:30,430
the source because they can't afford to

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,130
buy unreal tournaments middleware

00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:35,019
because it costs a hundred thousand

00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:37,749
dollars or something like that for a

00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:40,680
license so i've been using things like

00:59:37,749 --> 00:59:43,390
yoga and stuff like that to teach the

00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,849
students the concepts so that they can

00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,079
then go along and use it and there's

00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:49,900
lots of cool stuff coming out of

00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:52,749
academia there's also lots of cool stuff

00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:59,670
can from academia in a totally unrelated

00:59:52,749 --> 01:00:02,759
direction using games for education like

00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:09,630
there's a big problem at the moment with

01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:12,009
getting women into computer science and

01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:16,059
there's some really good stuff going on

01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:18,969
at carnegie mellon about making computer

01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:23,079
programming fun in terms of more

01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:28,499
interesting to different people to

01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:30,819
access it and uh yeah Alice that's a

01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:34,140
Carnegie Mellon's written this engine

01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:36,969
which supposed to make writing games

01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,709
much easier and you write it like a

01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:41,440
script in a movie or something like that

01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:44,349
rather than programming and then after

01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,599
they learn all about all these concepts

01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,849
you then kind of turn around and say oh

01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:50,890
yeah now you know how to program because

01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:54,849
they do learn all this stuff they just

01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:56,979
didn't realize it there's stuff on I

01:00:54,849 --> 01:01:00,609
don't know how well it works and Alice I

01:00:56,979 --> 01:01:02,949
haven't had much exposure to it but

01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:07,509
there's a really really strong one chord

01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:17,949
um I think it's ren pie it's actually

01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:20,170
very very popular among among like in

01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:23,380
japan at the moment because lots of

01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:24,849
people it you write us kind of a it's

01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,609
kind of like text-based adventure games

01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:33,160
but with graphics so you write a kind of

01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:37,010
script of how you want your game to game

01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:40,290
to progress and there

01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:48,990
these games are really really popular

01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:51,180
among certain groups and I believe like

01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:53,430
the penetration of that in females is

01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:57,330
the community is eighty-five percent

01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:59,490
female and if there's a huge amount of

01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:02,190
non-english stuff going on there as well

01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:06,150
games tend to be segregated to the

01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:07,970
English markets because of the cost of

01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:11,850
commercial computer games they cost

01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:14,130
fifty sixty dollars so you need to

01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:17,580
produce them in English because there's

01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:20,480
only so many people who will be willing

01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:25,770
to pay had that much disposable income

01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:27,810
so yeah it's there lots of interesting

01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:30,090
things coming out of education with our

01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:33,750
PC there's lots of interesting kind of

01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:37,530
game stuff coming up on the old pc i'm

01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:39,120
specifically even using pygame pygame

01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:41,120
works on the OPC and there's some

01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:45,110
interesting things happening there

01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:48,300
there's just such a wide variety of

01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:52,470
things that are happening there's a

01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:56,610
really good story about a guy who used

01:02:52,470 --> 01:03:01,110
he has an autistic son so he developed a

01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:04,890
game using pie gang for his autistic son

01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:09,600
to play there aren't that many autistic

01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:14,790
people in the world so this game is now

01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:18,060
really popular among this niche

01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:21,020
community because of the open source

01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:24,240
stuff he was able to produce this and

01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:26,070
they can access it it's like a

01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,560
commercial game company wouldn't come

01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:30,960
along and say there's X there's this

01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,430
really niche population I'm going to

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,650
produce a game for them because they

01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:39,720
won't see us being profitable whereas

01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:45,300
forces began to provide this so I think

01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:49,340
it's probably time to wrap stuff up step

01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,340
correct Leslie

01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,119
I'm quite I'm gonna be around so feel

01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:02,119
free to come and check to me personally

01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:07,430
or argue with me with stuff you don't

01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:09,650
agree with or correcting me on like

01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,119
various things I've got wrong and I'm

01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,480
not perfect and there's just so much

01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,910
going on that I'm sure everyone in this

01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,670
room has seen something in the force

01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:25,670
world that are yet to come across I've

01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:27,800
been doing this for I 89 years and every

01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:29,930
foss conference I go to there's at least

01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,500
two or three projects I go wow I

01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:35,090
wouldn't think that's possible wow I

01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:37,220
didn't know people were working on that

01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:40,550
I didn't think people could work on that

01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:43,340
so it's pretty cool time to be involved

01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:46,940
with it thank you very much for

01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:49,270
listening to you and I hope you have a

01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,270
