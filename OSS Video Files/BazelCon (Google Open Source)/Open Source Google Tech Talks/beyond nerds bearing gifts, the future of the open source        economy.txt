so thanks very much for inviting me here

00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:16,320
it's neat to see Google Australia the

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:20,160
place for Google Maps was born I'm from

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,769
the paleo geographer side of the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,630
geographer family was to say i was

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:30,630
doing Jes before 2005 and that gives me

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,170
kind of a shaken by the earthquake view

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,120
of what Google Earth Google Maps and

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,380
some extent google earth did to to our

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,140
field will actually google maps at far

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,590
more than Google Earth Sony this is my

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,820
first trip to Australia and I was really

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,860
expecting a bit of a culture shock

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,320
coming for the northern hemisphere so I

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,690
prepared a few special slides but it

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,219
turns out that the equipment is

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,460
compatible and everything is back still

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,719
works as I'd expect and I'm a problem

00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,670
which I like to share if the unit's not

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,160
an uncommon problem it's probably a

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,369
problem a few of you share my problem is

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,530
I have a mother-in-law and and when we

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,909
sit down to Christmas dinner which is

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,740
coming up she has this question that she

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,900
asks and it's a perfectly reasonable

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,729
question for a mother-in-law to ask us

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,259
on in LA she asked me what is it that i

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,150
do what do i do for a living the subtext

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,159
being am i doing something that can

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,750
rationally be expected to help support

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,200
her perfect daughter and two darling

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,439
grandchildren and this is where things

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,670
get difficult because what I do is I sit

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,150
in my office at the back of the house

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,710
and I work on software that people are

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,700
encouraged to deploy and download and

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,799
use for free for free and she

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,420
understands the programming part of it

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,770
well enough at least insofar as i sit in

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,119
front of my computer and i type things

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,950
on it but the for free part causes

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,329
serious discomfort because how do the

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,240
perfect daughter and the two doll and

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,799
grandchildren get supported for free why

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,020
am i confident that i can earn a living

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,009
in my chosen field when my work product

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,310
is free am I crazy perhaps by some kind

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,400
of utopian hippie maybe maybe not good

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,260
son-in-law material at least the

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,730
proximate answer and this is

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,290
on a good night this is probably enough

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,620
to cool her off is that I'm employed by

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,879
a company open G oh that pays me to sit

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,540
and work on the software that we give

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,989
away for free voila but it doesn't take

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,250
much to see past that dodge and by here

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,819
second class of wines you'll come around

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,470
again so who pays open G 0 for this free

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,450
software who indeed in the competitive

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,890
marketplace full of beasts like Oracle

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,739
and Apple and Microsoft how can

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,709
something as warm and soft and cuddly

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:54,900
and fluffy as an open-source company

00:02:49,709 --> 00:03:02,159
survive what is it exactly that we are

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,840
selling yeah yeah don't free the bunny

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,870
Duval more don't be the bunny to Vollmar

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,190
if you want to understand what

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,409
open-source companies are selling it

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,220
helps to understand what existing

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:15,989
proprietary vendors are selling and

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,940
here's a surprising part they aren't

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:23,280
selling software what they're selling is

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,609
product let me explain why what I mean

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,690
by that in the business classic crossing

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,430
the chasm which I highly recommend

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,680
Geoffrey Moore says that in the

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,449
technology adoption lifecycle which is

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,060
traditionally understood as a smooth

00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,980
passage from the small early market of

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,019
visionaries and early adopters to the

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,430
large mainstream market of pragmatist

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,299
and conservatives there's a little

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,310
understood gap in fact a huge chasm

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:49,739
between the small early markets and the

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,209
big mainstream markets and the chasm is

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,209
there because the personalities the

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,319
customers in the early markets are very

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,049
different from the personality of

00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,180
customers in the mainstream market early

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,280
adopters and visionaries have a very

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,840
high tolerance for risk they like to

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,180
learn things themselves they don't need

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,220
a lot of support here's an early adopter

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,280
with the iphone that he bought on the

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,290
first day they were available the

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,919
mainstream customers are exactly the

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,630
opposite in order to prosper growing

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,799
software companies have to cross the

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,930
market chasm

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,190
and to do so Geoffrey Moore says they

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,800
have to transition from selling just

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:30,270
software into selling what he calls a

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,949
whole product now a naive young

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,750
technology company might say hey but we

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,240
have a product it's on this cd-rom right

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,729
here but they don't have a product what

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,729
they have its software well they have a

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,180
salable in the early markets but not in

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,460
the mainstream markets the whole product

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,110
has software at its core but it adds in

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,539
a critical layer of extra services and

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,879
infrastructure around the outside things

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:56,430
that reduce the risk or the perceived

00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,889
risk associated with adopting the

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,900
product training courses support

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,120
infrastructure resellers consulting

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,300
networks update mechanisms these kinds

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,949
of things and it's the combination of

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,750
the software with the added layer of

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:14,819
valuable extras that makes a compelling

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,560
whole product only a whole product can

00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,300
move from the adventurous early adopter

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,479
market into the risk adverse mainstream

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,569
market for example example of a whole

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,759
product Oracle as a piece of database

00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,159
software Oracle is not all that

00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,990
compelling it's kind of bulky it's

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,190
really hard to learn it's pretty easy to

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,330
screw it up being when you have learned

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,529
it but you add in a 300-pound shelf of

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,630
professionally written documentation

00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:41,669
training to build a population of

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,590
developers administrators a rich

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,979
ecosystem of third-party tools a

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,039
reputable if mercenary company providing

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,569
support an evil genius and deep

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,979
integration with the other elements of

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,860
the Oracle software portfolio you

00:05:52,979 --> 00:06:00,690
portfolio portfolio you have a very

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,090
compelling whole product now here's an

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,009
odd thing even though it's very easy to

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,259
see that the whole product offers

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,870
tremendous value above and beyond the

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,639
software itself our mental model of

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,300
technology acquisition is still one

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,830
where a pay money for the software and

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,979
the vendor throws in the rest of the

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,340
whole product for free all that great

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,930
extra value for free and this is where

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,520
our cognitive dissonance about open

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,339
source software companies comes from

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,800
because what happens to our mental model

00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,300
when the cost of the software goes to

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,860
zero

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,900
no company can give away the software

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,240
for free and provide the rest of the

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,760
whole product for free something has to

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,140
give now for the early adopters and

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,050
technological village visionaries the

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,910
people in the early market and let's be

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,860
honest that's basically you kind of

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,040
people there's no problem they just take

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,360
advantage of the software as is and they

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,680
and they take advantage of the thinner

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,600
layer of support provided by the open

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,120
source community for free they don't

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,600
need the whole product and they probably

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,270
never will but what about that huge

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,890
early majority and late majority what's

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,770
it going to take to get them to adopt

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,390
open source software the low price of

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,650
the software alone is insufficient to

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,470
seal the deal because the rest of the

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,090
whole product is missing so the

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,820
long-term open source business model as

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,790
a general proposition it's about

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,130
providing a whole product suitable for

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,550
mainstream customers but changing the

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,260
point of monetization instead of

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,970
companies selling software and cross

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,170
subsidizing a free network of services

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,670
for customers we're going to have

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,990
customers selling access to a free

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,090
network of surf through the network of

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,270
services and cross subsidizing the

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,070
development of free software this is

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,320
precisely the Red Hat Linux development

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,550
model let's say you've got some open

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,860
source software to being developed on

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,580
the internet you've got red hat and a

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,080
risk-averse mainstream customer he gives

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,270
Red Hat money for red hat enterprise

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,550
linux redhat uses that money to build a

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,710
whole product and a fun open-source

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,720
software development they take a copy of

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,780
the raw software and give it to the

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,480
customers a whole product the customer

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,450
could simply download the software

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,790
directly but then he wouldn't get

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,180
support automatic upgrades testing and

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,130
so on and for a mainstream customer that

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,610
feels like a very risky situation to be

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,930
in that's how an open-source company is

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,250
supposed to work in the ideal situation

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,150
however it's not like the old

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,099
proprietary model is just fading away

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,229
Microsoft is a 223 billion-dollar

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:38,140
company Oracle's 103 billion dollar

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,170
company and sa p less CP is a 58 billion

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,900
dollar company the biggest open source

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,240
software vendor Red Hat is a 5 billion

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,600
dollar

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,010
company so maybe I should be worried

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,470
maybe we should be polishing my resume

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,209
both open source and open source

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,180
companies sound like fluffy helpless

00:08:53,209 --> 00:09:00,200
bunnies godly and fun to play with but

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,570
way over match in the marketplace why am

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,279
I so confident I'm confident because

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,990
there's more to this story than just the

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,200
market for shrink wrap software and

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,130
there is a lot more to the fluffy bunny

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,690
than meets the eye the fluffy bunny is

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,260
busy transforming the field of

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:23,950
information technology in profound ways

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:27,230
leavin carnage in its wake for example

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,029
The Economist magazine arbiter of all it

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,430
is free good and great in the free

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,350
market orthodoxy has already taken in

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,839
the situation and declared open source

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,630
software a serious player open source

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,279
software has won the argument it is now

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,390
generally accepted that the future will

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,380
involve both to blend of both

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,420
proprietary and open source software how

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,950
can this be the leading open-source

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,930
software company has a market

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,870
capitalization less than three percent

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,820
of the leading proprietary company I can

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,660
open source win the argument if it's so

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,520
manifestly overmatched here's how first

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,950
understand you can't comprehend the

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,950
success of open source exclusively by

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,540
looking at the market place in the

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,850
market place the unit of competition is

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,279
the company of the measure of success is

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,200
profit the more dollars you take in the

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,130
more successful you are and if you taken

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,040
a few too few dollars you go extinct

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,060
that might sound a little familiar lots

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,010
of people have noticed that there's

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,140
parallels between the market and the

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,610
field of evolutionary biology when taken

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,520
to extreme you'll get theories like

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,010
social Darwinism but for our case the

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,040
metaphor is instructive only the strong

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,290
survive those companies organisms that

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,810
best adapt to their markets environments

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,910
take in the most money food or energy

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:48,020
and those that do not go extinct they go

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,700
bankrupt also asked with evolutionary

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,860
biology is easy to be distracted by the

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,630
lumbering beasts that appear to be the

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,240
ones directly engaged in competition and

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,910
that's a bad thing because the really

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,470
important

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,080
petition is not at the level the

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,820
organism but at a lower level much

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,880
farther down in the realm of the gene

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,260
the competition between genes is

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,300
described by richard dawkins in his book

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,030
The Selfish Gene which is an exploration

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,100
of how simple selfish reproductive

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,200
behavior at the level of genes can lead

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,380
to apparently altruistic behaviors at

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,300
the level of the organism in Dawkins

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,610
formulation behaviors that maximize the

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,590
chances of genetic survival are past to

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,780
future generations even when those

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,430
behaviors endanger the survival or a

00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,340
particular organism so for example

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,560
here's a behavior that makes no sense in

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,900
an organism centric model this is a

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,920
killdeer on Vancouver Island where I

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,750
live engaging in a distraction display

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,990
the parent bird puts on an elaborate and

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,610
totally fake display of being injured to

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,230
draw an approaching videography and

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,540
poaching predator or in this case

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,720
 with video camera away from its

00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,140
young the parent organism is placing

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,850
itself at great risk here why because

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,650
the strategy is a good way to preserve

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,560
the genetic heritage of the children in

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,930
the nest now the self of gene came out

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,550
in 1976 and in the opening pages Dawkins

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,840
says this to say about some of his

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,000
contemporaries and you can see right

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,570
away where he gets his reputation as a

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,800
gentle and self-effacing man the trouble

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,430
with these other books is that vague

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,420
authors got it totally and utterly wrong

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,840
they got it wrong because they

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,280
misunderstood how evolution works they

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,050
made the erroneous assumption that the

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,120
important thing in evolution is the good

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,620
of the species or the group rather than

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,720
the good of the individual or the gene

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,550
the same criticism applies to people who

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,840
attempt to understand success of open

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,930
source through an analysis of the

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,120
marketplace they misunderstood and

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,510
misunderstand how software lives and

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,850
dies confusing the host with what it

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,200
carries because the unit of competition

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,160
in the world of software is not the

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,779
corporation it is the program its

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,689
software its code

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,329
in the biosphere organisms feed on other

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:10,509
organisms which feed on plants which

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:12,040
feed on light for mr. Sun so in the end

00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:14,199
of competition is four sources of energy

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,149
either direct from the form of sunlight

00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:19,559
or stored in the bodies of plants and

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:23,680
other animals in the cybersphere

00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,629
programs also compete for resources the

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,480
resource that programs compete for is

00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:33,600
developer time commonly known as human

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:36,160
attention so programs feed on developers

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,720
who in turn feed on caffeinated

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,160
beverages and try to stay away from mr.

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,009
Sun programs need programmer attention

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,689
to survive a program that is no longer

00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:49,389
being maintained and updated is a

00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:52,629
program that is dying a program that no

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:54,399
one has a use for is dead first you'll

00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:56,819
be abandoned unrung then it'll become

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,589
unrunnable and then it'll be deleted

00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:04,029
programs need programmer attention to

00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:05,170
survive you don't believe me when Oracle

00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:07,240
gobbles up yet another enterprise

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,129
software company do the software

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,980
customers bemoan the death of the

00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:15,189
company no primarily they worry about

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,389
the software well the bugs be fixed well

00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,550
that next release come out with a new

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,319
features will the developers leave and

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,800
flee to greener pastures will a new

00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:25,930
owner continue to feed the software and

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,309
what is the software worried about all

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,160
it matters to the software is that it

00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:33,069
continues to receive a steady supply of

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,750
developer time when you understand the

00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:37,059
competition between proprietary and open

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,529
source has a competition at the program

00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,629
level it clears away a lot of

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,129
distractions because now we can directly

00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,319
evaluate which strategy is the most

00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:46,750
adaptable strategy for software survival

00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:49,959
the open source model or the proprietary

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,269
model a proprietary program can best be

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,279
understood as a form of parasite it

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,439
resides in symbiosis with its host

00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,720
organism the corporation that owns it

00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:00,100
and it draws its sustenance exclusively

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,709
from the developers provided by the

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,329
corporation the amount of sustenance

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,470
provided in the program pretty directly

00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,120
correlates the success of the

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,920
corporation selling the program though

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,970
sales success Mariana may or may not

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,309
correlate with the quality of the

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,769
program and when the corporation dies

00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,179
the program usually dies too

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,129
if the corporation is subsumed by

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:20,019
another corporation the new host may

00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,939
continue to feed the program starve it

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:25,059
to death or terminate it immediately in

00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:26,559
favor of some other program when you

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,999
think about it that way it's easy to

00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,100
feel a little bit sorry for a

00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,860
proprietary program it's very much at

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,059
the mercy of its host its success or

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,739
failure may have nothing to do with the

00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,509
intrinsic its intrinsic quality

00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:39,429
they may have only a very small team of

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:43,089
developers to love it feed it and carry

00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:45,129
it forward if it should die in contrast

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,350
to the sheltered monastic existence of

00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:48,730
proprietary software the lifestyle love

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,399
open-source software is incredibly

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,019
promiscuous any developer with a nice

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,170
smile and a good patch is welcome to

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,220
join the party open source programs can

00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,079
draw a substance in the form of

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,519
long-term stable commitments from

00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,160
corporations who sell products or

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,929
services around the software or from

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,910
devoted contractors who drive-in come

00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:09,339
from contractor feature development or

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,379
bug fixes that's actually an in-joke for

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,029
open source geospatial software Frank is

00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:16,029
probably the most prolific independent

00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,860
contractor in the field he works on four

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,689
or five different really core libraries

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,869
that are used across the whole ecosystem

00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:24,279
or from quick relationships with casual

00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:29,860
developers who just drop off a patch

00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:31,899
runaway in contrast proprietary programs

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,389
are embedded within the institutional

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,290
framework of a corporation so it's much

00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:38,410
harder for them to form relationships

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,299
with new sources of development people

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,639
can't just stroll in the door and add a

00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,529
new feature to Microsoft Word the

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,179
relationship between developer and

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:50,259
proprietary software is formal

00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:51,819
contractual and exclusive open source

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,740
programs can form relationships with

00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:55,480
multiple developers and multiple

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,490
organizations simultaneously because

00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,740
open source is not trapped inside a

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,240
single organization the rules of

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,369
participation or cultural not

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,209
contractual and broad community

00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:08,770
participation is the whole point take

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,919
the most successful open-source example

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,449
Linux

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,459
the Linux software has gone from drawing

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,949
development effort exclusively from a

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,360
single finished graduate student to

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,279
receiving the attentions of hundreds of

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,980
fully funded developers in multiple

00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,449
fortune 500 corporations even

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,699
organizations that in direct market

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,249
competition IBM and Oracle a red hat

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,019
novel they provide code to Linux and

00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,549
toted thousands of other developers with

00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,919
institutional affiliations ranging from

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,259
top secret government agencies academia

00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,730
to individual developers whose only real

00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:43,710
affiliation is to their cat in their

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,360
coffee vendor in fact kernel developer

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,460
greg kroah-hartman did a study of the

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,529
kernel source code in 2008 the knee

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,330
found that the number one affiliation of

00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:55,129
kernel developers was unaffiliated

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,869
seventy percent of the Linux kernel

00:17:55,129 --> 00:18:01,110
unaffiliated Red Hat was number two at

00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:03,149
eleven percent the example of Linux

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,649
shows that open source programs are not

00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,960
limited to feeding off pure open-source

00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:09,119
companies that can feed off any company

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,799
or organization or individual that

00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,850
derives competitive advantage from using

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,710
open source hmm like yourselves one of

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,789
the most perceptive observers and

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,710
commentators on the interest of

00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,049
open-source ideas in the marketplace is

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,119
the fellow named Matt sa he's a blogger

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,259
he's very prolific he writes pretty much

00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,269
every day and every day he write

00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,399
something that's worth reading and he

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,830
recently wrote we were all open-source

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:34,980
companies now which means that none of

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,659
us are what he means is that every

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,369
company in the marketplace is now

00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:43,559
deriving competitive advantage from open

00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:46,499
source one way or another oops even

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,299
deeply deeply proprietary companies IBM

00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:50,610
was once so proprietary that a make

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,470
microsoft look open by comparison but in

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,899
two thousand IBM was the first company

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,429
to adopt a Linux strategy they invest

00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,440
directly in the linux kernel to ensure

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,600
it runs on their cpus and systems that

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,950
our founder of the eclipse project and a

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
number of their proprietary products are

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,320
in fact built on that same project like

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,610
rational oracle has purchased several

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,440
open-source companies over the last

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,389
year's database companies like in a base

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,279
and sleepy cat and this year they

00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:16,259
purchase sun which netted them several

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,470
very well-known open-source names and

00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:21,679
they aren't just sitting on them

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,020
at Oracle OpenWorld last week Oracle's

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,900
evil genius promised to invest more

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,960
money in MySQL lion rd than mysql is

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,880
currently spending and even microsoft

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,190
which practically invented the idea of

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,900
proprietary shrink wrap software back in

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,909
the 70s has an active open source

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,710
strategy they're hosting an open source

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,960
code repository codeplex there are

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,190
sponsors the apache foundation they

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,960
invest in the development of windows

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,230
compatible open source like ironpython

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,490
and now even PHP they're investing in

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,650
they've even recently contributed

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:56,270
patches to the Linux kernel under the

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:58,520
GNU GPL in the geospatial industry as

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,679
well the momentum is more and more

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,059
towards open-source use ESRI is the

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,590
Microsoft of geospatial they use the

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,780
Google library so does Google Earth your

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,490
own going tool FM e or task all

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,860
proprietary all proprietary products

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,330
they use that open source library the

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,820
post just open source database that I

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,679
work with has been adopted as more and

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,900
more industry standard database people

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,940
expect to see their data stored in open

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,590
source databases so the proprietary

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,039
desktops are coming online and using

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,570
posters as a source of data when even

00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:32,419
the proprietary companies are investing

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,030
in open source what does it mean any

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:38,179
more to be an open source company

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,980
everybody's doing it people like to talk

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,690
about open source and the change from

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,600
proprietary open source as an open

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,570
source revolution but revolutions are

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:52,580
quick and turbulent affairs is it a

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:54,320
revolution if it takes 25 years I think

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,360
we're what we're experiencing is not an

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,150
open source revolution but an open

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,039
source evolution the progress is slow

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,530
and incremental but it's always in the

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,340
same direction month by month and year

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,840
by year we're just at the start of a

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,820
transformation of the software market

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,520
where purchasers recognize they have an

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,230
option to buy the whole product and get

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,640
the software for free and we're in the

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,100
middle of a transformation to how we

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,480
build software moving very quickly from

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,400
the closed corporate model where the

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,140
source code is private to an open

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,120
collaborative model where the source go

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,240
to the Commons

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,830
and it's that combination of those two

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,390
trends that feels me personally was

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,420
conference because those two trends are

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,470
reinforcing each other and that's why I

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,010
can look at my mother-in-law in the eye

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,870
and say don't worry it'll all work out

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,730
because I'm on the side of history on

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,990
the ground floor of a growing market

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:49,870
riding a wave that is just picking up

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:56,200
and I hope so we're all of you thanks

00:21:49,870 --> 00:22:08,230
very much so short and sweet anyone got

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:10,600
any questions yeah yeah yeahs opened you

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,410
ads company to be fair is very much a

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,429
start-up but we don't get our money from

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,690
traditional sources of venture capital

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:23,580
we are a social enterprise which is to

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:26,800
say that our goal is not to quintuple or

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,780
x factor of 10 the original investment

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,940
we would like to just simply return the

00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,460
original investment our source of

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,860
funding is a man named Mark Gordon in

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,970
New York he runs a hedge fund and he's

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,290
very very interested in the field of

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:43,390
urban planning so he funds a nonprofit

00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:47,230
called the open planning project which

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:50,260
does urban planning promotion in the

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,120
United States primarily and and out of

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,830
those efforts over the last 10 years

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,350
have grown a series of software tools

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,510
which are used in providing this urban

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,309
planning but they were built around open

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,520
source and it made sense to us to seed

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,590
this market to build an option so that

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,540
people who could not afford to play the

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,830
game in the proprietary field and

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,420
playing the game in geospatial the

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,510
proprietary field I must say is a very

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,720
expensive proposition and it locks out a

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,630
lot of organizations who have valid

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,010
social points to bring forward so mark

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,910
water to keep finding the software in

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,999
order to make sure that these

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,239
organizations were able to have a voice

00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:30,759
as the conversation became more digital

00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:33,519
so that's where our seed funding comes

00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,349
from we do a fair amount of services

00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,099
work right now for larger government

00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:40,719
organizations mostly doing

00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:42,639
implementations using the core of our

00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:45,909
open source software so geoserver

00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:49,839
openlayers jus EXT post kiss are the

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:54,129
products which we're wrapping up into an

00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:56,229
overall whole product but starting six

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,999
months ago and going forward we're

00:23:56,229 --> 00:24:00,849
working to transition ourselves from

00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:02,439
being a services company that uses some

00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:03,939
of that money and our funders money to

00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:06,909
build open-source company urban source

00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:09,159
software to being a product company that

00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:12,669
can generate enough revenue selling this

00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:14,949
whole product wrapped open-source piece

00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:17,259
to continue to fund the core development

00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:18,669
because we really want to see is this

00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:22,329
core software continue to get better

00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:24,489
year over year without people having to

00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,809
do it as a side project it really is

00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:26,799
important enough to be that people

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:32,789
should be able to do it as their

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,789
full-time job yeah

00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,510
there there are several axes along which

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,280
programs win you know win that

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,250
evolutionary battle and and one of them

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,960
is code quality right and and I

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,310
understand you you you know set up your

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,050
own internal processes of software

00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,640
developed to try to force that

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,380
competition towards code quality as much

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,620
as possible of course the other axes are

00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,870
things like do the users care and and

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,910
are the functionalities useful to large

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,990
large swaths of people or at least two

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:43,220
large swaths of organizations and

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,450
there's no guarantee that a software

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,620
project that gets there first will be

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,910
the one that survives the one that's

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,140
written best will be the one survives

00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,100
it's one that combines all those things

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,530
I think it is a good thing because

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,630
what's happening is the process of

00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,040
finding the best fit for society the

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,720
given moment has been decoupled from

00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,910
organizational imperatives like

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,050
marketing or sales or so on has become

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,570
very much a function of what actually

00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,690
does fit the needs of the largest number

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,560
of people the lot is a particular time

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,710
so yeah I think it actually is a good

00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:16,270
thing and I'm not really a free market

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,270
guy necessarily but I do yeah

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:33,019
how do i think the commercialization

00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:36,019
works with open source i think it only

00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:37,489
worked to the better because the people

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:39,739
who need the commercialized product will

00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:40,999
pay for it and if they won't the company

00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,950
won't be able to sell it again it's a

00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:47,619
very much a la the jungle kind of thing

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:49,820
and it doesn't appear particularly when

00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:53,899
projects reach a certain size it doesn't

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,209
appear that the the participation of

00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:58,129
even you know very ravenous competitive

00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:59,959
companies is a detriment to the

00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:03,799
development and continuation of software

00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:08,629
examples like Linux or clips and even

00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:11,119
MySQL now kind of speak to that I I

00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:13,479
think having companies involved is all

00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,479
to the good

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:31,610
yeah so yeah i'll put my or into the

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,230
religious argument and i should do so by

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,840
saying that initially my or was on the

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,970
other side of the canoe when i entered

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,680
into you know actually making an open

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:45,559
source project myself with post Jess we

00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,050
like sin to GPL because we felt that

00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,270
anyone who wanted to play should bloody

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:54,650
well be forced to come back into the

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:56,510
pool with their code since then having

00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,620
watched the evolution of a number of

00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,240
community system my lil narrow

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,179
geospatial space communities like map

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,550
server and Google ogr and so on and

00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:06,140
having talked to the reams and reams of

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:10,850
people who come and say I'm interested

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,440
in using your poster software but I

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,850
become convinced the important

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,440
ingredient is not that legalistic club

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:21,020
to force people back in it's the

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,820
existence of a vibrant community where

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,050
there is a strong vibrant community it

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,460
doesn't matter if someone takes their

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,720
toys and goes in place by themselves

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,340
because it's the vibrant community

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,170
that's going to outlast and outrun and

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,540
out-compete the people's playing with

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,429
the toys by themselves so I've really

00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,920
come to like you know completely free

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,750
licenses like BSD we're just take it and

00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,170
go and do whatever you want actually

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,100
even preferably the amended bsd that

00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,990
doesn't include the attribution

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,250
requirement that's a little bit of

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,470
license or canada by the way that i only

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,420
learned a couple years ago bsd in its

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,220
original form is not compatible to GPL

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,080
which means you can't put bsd code back

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,880
into a GPL project which can really slow

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,100
you down because it includes the

00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,900
attribution requirement which is a

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,570
restriction on use what's the GPL isn't

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,760
allow so there's actually lee thing

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,910
called modified bsd what to strip that

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,910
out

00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,310
yeah basically

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,100
yeah open source and name but not in

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,460
practice what do I think about it I

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,230
think it's profoundly counterproductive

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,210
but you know they pay the freight so

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,620
they get to make the choices but it's

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,809
kind of silly to license on the open

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,549
source and then not promote the growth

00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,460
of the one thing that really makes open

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,140
source a vibrant sort of future proof

00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,740
alternative which is the independent

00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,740
community

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,820
two

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:29,830
yeah to which red hat says no which is

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:35,710
fair enough because the point is that

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:37,270
they're not yeah yeah yeah yeah it isn't

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,830
a seat but I mean they're recognizing

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,020
where the market lies right i mean their

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,150
market is not that front tail and you

00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,090
know they're happy to have those guys go

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,850
off and support themselves or or not

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:51,820
that's the case maybe but yeah it's not

00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:55,240
where the money is for sure no my main

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,010
concern about red hat is not otherwise

00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,170
red hat model in general is not that it

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,350
doesn't work or make sense in the now

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:06,370
it's is that it makes less sense in the

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:08,410
future because step 14 sort of big

00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:11,260
fortune five companies 500 companies was

00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,480
to recognize that they were taking a

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,790
reaming I'm using proprietary UNIX and

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,410
proprietary operating systems that he do

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:20,230
a lot better financially by replacing

00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:21,730
that with Linux but because of their

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,150
comfort levels they chose to replace it

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:28,960
with something that had that same vendor

00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,580
feel they were used to before but a

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,090
fortune 500 company is big enough to

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,670
employ its own experts probably at a

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:40,230
lower cost than than what they're sent

00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:43,230
spending in licensing with red hat and

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,210
and my concern is that over the next

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,160
turn of the wheel these big enterprise

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,900
customers will realize that you know

00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,090
past a certain threshold of size it

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,410
makes sense for them to run this stuff

00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:57,010
in-house and that they get far better

00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,360
performance that there were sport

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,360
support infrastructure doing it that way

00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:07,650
exactly yeah and and it might be the

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,540
answer there and this is something that

00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,490
we we're very much cognizant of the

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,710
answer there is just to run faster to

00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,870
keep ahead of well to keep an head of

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,790
what's of what's really stable and an

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,680
infrastructural and you put it in place

00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,850
and you forget about it you know turning

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,070
on the electrical switch you know we

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,140
don't run our own electoral companies

00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:28,560
stay far enough ahead of that that that

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,450
you can stay relevant and I think again

00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,770
that's a healthy thing because

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,330
proprietary companies have the option of

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,130
locking their customers in and moving

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,080
very slowly basically as slow as the

00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,400
revenue cycle needs to be whereas we're

00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,270
gonna be forced to run as fast as the

00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,270
customers for sister

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,190
true

00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,190
yes

00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,930
it may well be that the enterprise size

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,490
necessary to achieve that level of scale

00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:13,690
is so big that it's not really going to

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:13,690
hurt red hat that much right yeah

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,539
I

00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,180
it's true companies might that like that

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,460
might actually still continue to fall in

00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,590
that narrow little tale of crazy early

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,990
adopters and there's a scale thing right

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,930
company big enough to afford to linux

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,760
experts only has two linux experts which

00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:49,620
means one bus could remove the linux

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:53,390
expertise in one go okay thanks for

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,390
