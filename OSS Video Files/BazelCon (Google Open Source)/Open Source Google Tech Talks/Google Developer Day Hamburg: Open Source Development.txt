Title: Google Developer Day Hamburg: Open Source Development
Publication date: 2010-10-27
Playlist: Open Source Google Tech Talks
Description: 
	In dieser Session erklären wir Ihnen, warum Google Open Source unterstützt und nutzt, und wie auch Sie davon profitieren können. Wir werden Ihnen einige Open Source-Projekte von Google vorstellen und auch über andere Initiativen rund um dieses Thema sprechen.

Jeremy Allison ist einer der leitenden Entwickler im Google Samba-Team in Mountain View. Diese Gruppe arbeitet an einer Windows-kompatiblen Open Source Datei- und Druckserver-Lösung für UNIX Systeme. Ähnlich wie das Linux System ist Samba dezentral über das Internet entwickelt worden und wird von allen Linux-Distributionen und mehreren tausend Unternehmen genutzt. Jeremy koordiniert die Samba-Entwicklungen und ist der Ansprechpartner für alle Unternehmen, die den Samba-Code kommerziell nutzen möchten.

okay well thank you very much for coming

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,280
to Google developer day we really

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,330
appreciate it my name is Jeremy Allison

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,610
I work in the mountain view office I've

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,849
been with Google since january of this

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,210
year as i mentioned earlier if you you

00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:29,239
may have missed me talking about the

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,770
presentation at the beginning

00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:35,550
unfortunately being a english and be

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,949
living in the US i have never learned

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,149
any of the languages so i'm very sorry

00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:41,789
this is going to have to be an english

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,460
presentation but if people would like

00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,589
and feel more comfortable about asking

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,929
questions in German I'm sure we can get

00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:50,339
someone to translate so that I can

00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:56,519
actually understand what you're asking

00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:59,519
me oh the other thing is please feel

00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:01,559
free to I know we have a question and

00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,080
answer period at the end but sometimes

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,550
people if I might say something that

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,040
people disagree with or they think I'm

00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,560
an idiot or something and they would

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,960
like to put your hand up and ask a

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,549
question please feel free to do that

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,210
during the talk if you don't ask a

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,670
question though I would it would be very

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,290
helpful for the recording people if you

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,020
could go to the mic at the bank so that

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,240
people will be able to hear you so Who

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,750
am I and why am I here and talking to

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,729
you about open source at Google well

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:36,030
I've been doing open source software for

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,820
a very long time before that was such a

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:43,500
term as open source started at Google

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:47,130
and in January I'm probably best known

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,649
for being one of the co-authors of Samba

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,820
which is an open source file and print

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:57,060
project that is pretty widely used if

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,500
you if you're using Windows and you

00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,969
double-click on a network neighborhood

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,890
it's there's a strong likelihood that

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,439
some of the servers that you see in your

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,110
organization are probably samba service

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,190
even though you might not know them as

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,160
and I have probably the world's

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:16,150
strangest job at Google because

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,180
essentially I don't really work on any

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,780
google code I tend to work on Samba code

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,260
for the most part and I also help other

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:30,310
companies use and incorporate the Samba

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,709
code in other projects and I also come

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,760
and give talks like this and i work with

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:38,739
Chris in the open source programs office

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,430
which is a very different kind of

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:44,769
organization to most open source open

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,840
source review officers and review boards

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,870
that many companies have and I'll talk a

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,370
little bit about that later on so a few

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,989
of the things we do a license compliance

00:02:51,370 --> 00:03:00,190
both incoming and outgoing the source

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:03,130
code we release code we have a team who

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,650
runs the Summer of Code program and we

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:10,840
also advise on doing protocol and API

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:12,640
left licensing for Google and I'm also

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,579
as I mentioned I'm a long time free

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,829
software advocate and I have a little

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:21,220
archive of columns that I do call the

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:23,620
low point the view from the valley which

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,930
is the Silicon Valley which are

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,130
available online if you if you're bored

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,280
and want to read anything so I'm going

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,359
to start with a little review of Google

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,359
I don't know whether you've seen these

00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:39,310
things before these slides are actually

00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:42,130
Chris's slides there a variant of the

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,700
talk that he's going to be giving or may

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,859
already have given in London so that

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,319
means any spelling mistakes or strange

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:55,269
mistakes on the slides I can claim there

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,920
that it was his fault not mine so this

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,359
is actually a picture of the very first

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,829
google cluster in Stanford I was

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,700
actually in the valley at the time but

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:09,069
not working at Stanford and it's

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,730
actually a bunch of Sun and IBM and

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:15,519
various pcs scrounged from departments

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,530
in Stanford University and it's actually

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,620
running a mixture of system

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:23,980
so it's running solaris it running Linux

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,540
I think there's air some AIX in there so

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,550
this is an interesting thing about

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,980
Google is that Google has always been

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,870
cross-platform it's never really been a

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,400
monoculture so making the software

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,169
portable and running on lots of

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,070
different systems has always been part

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:44,710
of the Google DNA so this is a close-up

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,210
picture of one of the herbal early

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,889
Google ranks and if you ever get the

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,250
opportunity to visit the Mountain View

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:55,720
campus there's actually one of these

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,400
ranks available to be viewed in the in

00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,260
one of the reception areas they don't

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,400
turn it on of course because it's a fire

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,400
hazard so interestingly enough this

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,729
shows how frugal Google was in the early

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,190
days with the hardware apparently the

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,680
reason for this is that data centers at

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,520
the time probably still are were

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,930
charging by the square meter so the more

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,820
machines Google engineers could cram

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,860
into a square meter the cheaper their

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:29,680
their costs were so underneath these CPU

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,620
boards underneath these motherboards are

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,260
in fact a layer of is a layer of cork so

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,930
that they don't short out when put on

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,630
the top of the metal ranks the disk

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:44,590
drives are essentially duct-taped to on

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:47,680
top of the memory I think and as you may

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,510
guess there were probably a lot of

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,570
hardware failures in this it was using

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,950
the cheapest possible IDE style drives

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,110
there's a lot of hardware failures you

00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,820
get an environment like this so this is

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,000
something quite interesting about Google

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,630
is that they're always use the cheapest

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,979
possible Hardware commodity hardware and

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:11,470
the way that they make it work is the

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,810
software the software has to be

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,539
intelligent essentially hardware sucks

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,910
and we'll break the software has to be

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:21,130
intelligent and to cope with failure and

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:26,500
so this is an interesting way of

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:28,150
attacking the problem so this is I think

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,340
a few years later getting somewhat

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,120
better you can still see that they have

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,210
a

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,510
you know a ten-dollar fan they're acting

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,630
is a cooling mechanism but you can see

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,630
at least the cables do seem to be tied

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,130
up a little better although you can see

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,520
some of the power strips there it's not

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:53,050
a great resolution photograph moving on

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:55,540
I think I think this is I'm not exactly

00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:01,900
sure when this is maybe four or five

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:05,470
years ago apparently this whole cage was

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,090
filled up by Google install people in

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,910
less than four hours so going from a

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,650
blank space to this miniature data

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,910
center took to go back less than four

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,660
hours so they were getting really really

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,280
good at this stuff and here's the the

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,580
latest picture that they let people see

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,320
which is not very you've got some

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,020
strange glowing green eyes in the

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,870
background there and and google has a

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,380
lot of computers now and I think the

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,630
hardware is is somewhat better designed

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,780
but it still fails it still really sucks

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:41,020
and the magic to make it all work is in

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:45,720
the software which is a very interesting

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,530
approach essentially using commodity pcs

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,870
Chris actually asked me to thank

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,240
everybody for buying the cheapest

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,130
possible pcs because essentially it's

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,650
commoditized everything and driven all

00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:00,550
the prices down a Google takes full

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,169
advantage of that so what I'm actually

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,419
going to be talking about so here's a

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:09,310
question for the audience who here uses

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:12,940
linux okay the people who have your

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:18,810
hands down do you do google web searches

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:21,039
yeah okay you're also using linux

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,190
because the thing you have to understand

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,370
is that every time you do a Google

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,010
search or you you know use any of the

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,130
Google applications all the back-end

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,930
infrastructure is built almost entirely

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,279
on top of free software so Google is a

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,069
massive consume

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,740
and producer a free software of

00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:49,779
open-source software I mean we're using

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:52,779
Python all sorts of web applications so

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:55,149
the free software ecosystem and

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,579
environment open source is incredibly

00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,870
important to Google and so that really

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,230
is what the rest of the talk is about

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,879
how we use free software why we use free

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,999
software because it's not immediately

00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,740
apparent essentially Google does have

00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:11,470
the resources to say right that's it

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,629
we're going to write google OS and do

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,240
things from scratch but but we don't do

00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:20,589
that unlike wise there are many other

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,180
things that we choose not to do and this

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,009
is one of the things that makes Google a

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,779
really great place to work if you're

00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,749
interested in open source or free

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:31,300
software and it's a very very friendly

00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:33,519
place there now i'll try and give you

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,079
some idea of the sense of that so here's

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,870
a wonderful quote from a friend of

00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,149
greg's dined who works also in the open

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,240
source program office a license can ruin

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,250
a perfectly good piece of software so i

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,839
don't know how many how many people here

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,529
are actually read an open-source license

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,040
or free software license ah boy people

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,540
with far too much time on their hands so

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,170
I mean personally I find they're very

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,019
interesting but that's kind of the area

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,589
i'm interested in but licenses are very

00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:08,920
very important with open-source software

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:12,730
licenses convey intent and they really

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:16,089
do many of the licenses have a history

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,209
behind them so a couple of the oldest

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,250
are the bsd license from berkeley the

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:24,029
berkeley software distribution and then

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:30,160
the gue GPL which is a recursive

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:33,370
algorithm for a license so originally

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,179
there was the bsd license which was

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:39,309
produced by berkeley and the first of

00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,829
the really free software licenses the

00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:46,749
reciprocal licenses was created by

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:48,490
richard stallman MIT and the reasons

00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:50,949
behind this are very very interesting i

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,889
first came across this license before I

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,399
even moved to the

00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:57,859
back when I was living living in England

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,859
and it's a very interesting document to

00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:03,249
read some of the first free software the

00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:08,660
first good new GP our licenses and

00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:10,069
essentially he had a problem in that he

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,730
was working in the artificial

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:16,429
intelligence lab and he ran across a

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,989
piece of hardware a printer the jammed

00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,720
every so often this is a very famous

00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:22,669
story you can search for it if you want

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,069
to hear it told in his words but

00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:26,689
essentially he wanted to fix that

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:30,199
problem as he had with many other

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:33,109
printers before and the person who had

00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,519
this new spiffy laser printer refused to

00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,649
give him a copy of the driver software

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,350
and said while I've had to sign a

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,389
nondisclosure agreement in order to get

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,079
a copy of this and and Richard was

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:46,879
completely outraged and so decided to

00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,699
make such a thing impossible and the way

00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,179
no reason the way he chose to do it was

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:54,769
to essentially decide to write his own

00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:57,199
POSIX and unix compatible operating

00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:02,649
system from scratch and replace all the

00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:05,119
proprietary stuff and so the amazing

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:10,669
essential is amazing arrogance of that

00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:13,699
of that wish just shows how forceful and

00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:15,319
how strongly Richard believes in the

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,079
free software movement and fee software

00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,790
licenses once you understand that many

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,639
many other things start to make sense

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,369
and many people agree with him agree

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,610
with him I mean I am personally a very

00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:30,410
very big fan of the new GPL I prefer to

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,350
use it for all of the software that I

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,439
create one of the nice things about

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,509
Google is that we are very license

00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:40,100
agnostic essentially an engineer

00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,319
creating software if they want to

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,360
release it as free software they do get

00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:47,149
to choose the license that they give it

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,160
away on them there are the reasons for

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,149
choosing various different licenses but

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:56,149
the ganute GPL is incredibly popular

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,100
fifty percent of all free so fossil

00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,699
floss free and liberal open source

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,040
software is a very common acronym we use

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,470
fifty percent of all

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,269
free software open source software is

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,730
under the canoe GPM and Google and samba

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,699
my own project I've also been involved

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,589
in the drafting and review process for

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:20,560
the for the third version of the license

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:24,880
the GPL version 3 and we're extremely

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,699
supportive of it so basically if you

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,290
understand if you understand that the

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,269
the fundamentals are where rich is

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,839
coming from the GNU GPL makes a lot more

00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:37,810
sense so where did the term open source

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,649
come from well actually was it was a

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,990
marketing exercise a rebranding exercise

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:46,959
done by Tim O'Reilly the publisher of

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,639
The O'Reilly books eric raymond who'd

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,529
recently written the cathedral and the

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:57,190
bazaar and they saw problem and a few

00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:59,500
others i think i was working at VA linux

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:05,290
at the time so Larry August did my boss

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,190
was there free was a problem because in

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:12,130
in English free is a confusing term it

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:16,540
means both without cost and it also

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:18,790
means without restrictions and business

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,069
people like that without cost part but

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,569
they don't like the sort of without

00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,850
restrictions because business is all

00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:27,040
about putting restrictions on things and

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,139
so they decided that to come up with a

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,720
new term that would be more business

00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:34,959
friendly and actually came up with this

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,000
term open source which because free was

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,089
too weird remember this is the United

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,940
States and sort of a very strange

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,399
society where where freedom is equated

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:50,800
with evil communism or you know other

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:53,170
such things so they rebranded it they

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,000
remarketed is open source which sounded

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,019
much more catchy and started putting

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,250
working out what open source actually

00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,959
meant and putting all these like

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,930
categorizing all these licenses

00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:07,329
underneath that umbrella so you have

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,730
other licenses were appearing BFD

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:12,880
obviously is very old I think possibly

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,829
older than the gnu GPL so was MIT but

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,570
then there were newer newer licenses

00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:18,570
like the apart

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:22,500
license and the mozilla license for the

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,970
newly released mozilla code and for a

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,920
while it was sort of like the

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,570
open-source license of the week cloth

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,700
you know some company would announce

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,030
that they were releasing code and come

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,370
up with a new license son did one and

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,370
you know tiller credit google has never

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,320
done anything like that you know HP is

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,300
another company that never did that

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,920
decided that they there were enough

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:49,380
open-source licenses they were not going

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,240
to create any any of their own so that

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,490
was the the history behind open source

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,380
so what actually is an open-source

00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:01,170
license well the idea is that it's any

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,070
license that's approved by a small board

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,630
of people the open source initiative and

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:10,230
complies with their definition the open

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,790
source definition which you can you can

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,060
happily read if you search for open

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,120
source definition is that first hit the

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,280
problem is they didn't trade market so

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,870
essentially anybody can say we are an

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,780
open source company with an open source

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,820
license that is very close to the GPL

00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,100
but with a few restrictions and

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,860
essentially it's not a very meaningful

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,570
perm really this is one of the reasons

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,640
why Richard Stallman refused to go along

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,260
with open source and stuck to his guns

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:44,790
with free software it's it's not well

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,980
defined many firms will call themselves

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,160
open because hey open is good right you

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,900
know open XML or whatever but it's not

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,880
really open there are restrictions for

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,840
patents there are restrictions you know

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,550
on use this there's no you can't stop

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,410
somebody calling something open source

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,040
when it really isn't and that's one of

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:08,579
the problems too many licenses there are

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,500
60 of them approved to date and I used

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,910
to work at HP on their open source

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,970
review board on one of our major

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,500
headaches was essentially working out

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:21,280
the matrix of what licenses will compact

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,650
with which and it's a real headache and

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,209
we have the same problem at Google we

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,030
have a very nice solution for it which

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,190
I'll talk about a little bit later so

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,040
misuse of the term and lots of scare

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:37,840
tactics from from various vendors around

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,730
open source so the the intentions were

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,710
extremely good they were based on the

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,110
debian linux distribution free software

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,550
guidelines and done by originally i

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:52,470
think by bruce parents and it has no

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:56,050
field of use restrictions no royalties

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,580
safer the media costs obviously the

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,370
source code must be available for people

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,440
to download no discrimination just

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,450
because you don't like you know software

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,310
used for military use you can't say that

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,350
this must not be used for military use

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,010
it while you can but it's just not an

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,540
open source license by definition then

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:17,170
obviously the code must be redistributed

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:21,460
or by people who obtain the code but

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:23,470
it's confusing you couldn't really it's

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,630
well intentioned but it has a lot of

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,720
confusing terms in it one of the big

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,490
ones is the license must not restrict

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,710
other software is one of the terms to

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,960
match the open source definition but

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,430
what does that mean so for instance

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,710
Apache obviously open source software

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:44,110
sits on port 80 on any machine is

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,120
running on no other software can bind to

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,340
port 80 while Apaches running is that

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:53,980
restricting of the software you know

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:56,050
Samba binds to ports 139 and 445 no

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,760
other SMB server combined to those ports

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,570
while Sam breeze is running are we

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,490
restricting of the software so so these

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,220
things like must be specific to a

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,500
product muhsin restricts of the software

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,900
must be technology-neutral they're not

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:17,290
very meaningful terms and then they're

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:19,150
not very well defined so essentially you

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,210
have this somewhat confusing mix of

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:26,200
licenses and definitions but what you

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,470
have to remember is it really is getting

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,010
down to intent

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:34,010
so you can categorize the licenses into

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,250
three main times real which are Apache

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,780
BSD MIT style license which is

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,730
essentially are you can do anything you

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,590
like so long as you didn't claim you you

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,020
wrote the software yourself so you can

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,520
incorporate it into proprietary code you

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,990
don't have to give anything back you

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,240
don't have to give out the source code

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,690
that they are completely free for most

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,840
uses of the term then you have the

00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,559
letter ganoub Public License the MPL and

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,900
Sons I think it's C ddl I think that's

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,730
that's the Sun one so essentially that

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,039
says that the software that they're

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,830
giving you under this license must

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,720
remain free but you can link and add

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,580
other parts of software that don't have

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,320
to remain free so essentially there's a

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,600
core part of the software that if you

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,669
modified directly you must make

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,010
available and you must redistribute the

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:25,220
source code but you can add other pieces

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:28,340
that you can keep closed so that's kind

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,780
of a hybrid model and then if and then

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:35,210
there's the GPL and other reciprocal

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,929
licenses which essentially say if you

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:41,450
make changes and you redistribute the

00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:43,460
change if you register boot a program

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,370
based on this you must give everybody

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,230
the changes that you made you must give

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,799
everybody the full source code and they

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,150
have the same rights that you do so

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,250
essentially for all the confusion you

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:59,390
can really think of most open-source

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:01,460
licenses as having these three possible

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,179
and that's kind of how we categorize

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:09,710
them internally now the interesting

00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:11,510
thing is all of the licenses the thing

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:16,039
that triggers that the licenses that

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:18,200
have requirements is redistribution so

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,720
you can take any of these licenses if

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,580
you're simply using them internally to

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,590
your own company you can take them in

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,570
you can make whatever changes you like

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,740
and you don't have to give anything to

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:32,750
anybody you can you can take you know

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,360
GCC create a completely proprietary fork

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,340
of it keep it internally so so long as

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,559
you never redistribute that to your

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,889
customers or part of a product

00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:45,320
so completely you can make private

00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:47,360
modifications so that's extremely useful

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,840
and obviously is something that Google

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,700
takes a great deal of advantage of so

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,779
essentially you don't have to give

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,879
things back if you don't redistribute

00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:07,720
yes question can you go to the mic is

00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:12,440
that possible so you said as an example

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:15,259
GCC mm-hmm if you create a completely

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,269
proprietary Fork of it aha and then use

00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:22,970
it to make binaries of your program yes

00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:25,519
and distribute those binaries yes what

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,470
happens do um so the question is if

00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,509
you'd make a proprietary fork and you

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,369
build binaries with that can you then

00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:32,929
redistribute those you make proprietary

00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,629
barneys can you then redistribute them

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:37,820
yes you can okay yep because that's

00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:41,179
completely allowed by the license that's

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:44,749
not what Google does by the way just in

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,639
case you were worried but yes that there

00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:48,320
have been occasions where people have

00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:51,529
done that and that's actually perfectly

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,970
allowable by the license GCC actually is

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:59,240
one of the projects that we give back a

00:22:52,970 --> 00:23:03,499
lot too so so let me just work out where

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:08,119
I am on on the notes yes Sookie Dom

00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:10,610
distribution so why do people do this I

00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,169
mean this is an interesting question why

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,570
do people create these things that other

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:17,860
people are getting immense value from so

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,240
the boston consulting group and the OS

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,230
open-source developer network that's run

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,850
by and over company in the u.s. they

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,950
actually did a study they asked the

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:31,070
developers on sourceforge which is the

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,809
most popular site for giving away free

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,070
and open source software and they they

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,590
asked them the question why do you do

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,629
this what you get out of it and it's

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,049
very interesting the replies that came

00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:44,090
back the largest answer is actually and

00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:47,269
I can completely understand this because

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,290
essentially I got into it for the same

00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:51,530
reasons it

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:55,820
it's purely intellectual PR curiosity

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:57,380
it's fun doing this is fun so I mean in

00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,300
many ways I have the best job in the

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,490
world because I get paid to do what I

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,180
used to do on weekends and evenings for

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,860
a hobby which is very nice skills

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,100
improvement is some of it it's always

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,660
nice to get better or what you do

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,910
personally I started working on sander

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,850
because I needed it at work I needed

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,950
something that did what Samba did but I

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,660
soon got dragged into the rat hole of

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,020
improving it on week evenings and

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:27,670
weekends because it was fun to do

00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:32,240
there's obviously a lot of idealism and

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:33,830
getting status essentially raising your

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,900
profile within the community by doing

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:40,340
this work one of the very interesting

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,440
things is that a very low number is

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:47,030
because people dislike proprietary

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,650
software I mean I'm you know I've worked

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,600
for proprietary software vendors I do

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,820
work for propriety software and Adam

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,190
dislike proprietary software I don't 80

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,780
I've written it in the past you know and

00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,580
if I couldn't do open source work i

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,860
would i would write it again it's that i

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,900
actually prefer to do open source would

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,210
cuz it's more fun it's more stimulating

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:09,860
it's you know it's collaborating with a

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:12,050
lot more people so essentially this is

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,810
the open source developers are adults

00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:17,180
and slide you know people say oh you

00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,980
terrible corporations you take this open

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,590
source code and you exploit the poor

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,900
developers well the developers adults

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,780
they know what they're doing they choose

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,460
licenses for a reason they choose them

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,530
with specific intense if they want to do

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,140
commercial proprietary software they do

00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:41,030
commercial for priority software if you

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,890
choose the bsd or MIT license you know

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,350
that you are giving your stuff away and

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,570
you don't complain about it well except

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,250
for the odd occasion like Theodore app

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,370
complaining that nobody gave you many

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,750
one ever open at this age but you always

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,990
get a you always get a few people

00:25:53,750 --> 00:26:00,110
complaining I that always kind of amuses

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,370
me because I'm I personally don't write

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,140
software under that life

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,690
so it always seems to me like somebody

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,890
complaining that hey I stood on the

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,260
street corner with all my possessions

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,780
with a sign saying free please everyone

00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,870
take and I ended up naked in homeless

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,600
what happened so I don't think you can

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,700
really complain about that the vast

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,680
majority of people expect nothing back

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,040
for the work other than actually the fun

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,970
of making what it is that they're doing

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:31,400
and essentially if you want to keep more

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,070
control of your open source software you

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:41,420
use the reciprocal licenses like the new

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:43,429
GPL so essentially Google takes the

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,200
open-source software and uses it to

00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,809
build the Google infrastructure that

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,350
everybody gets to use so we use the

00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:52,700
Linux kernel we obviously use many many

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,490
of the open source system management

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,550
tools everything in Google is really

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:02,290
built around open source software

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:05,120
there's a Google version of linux ubuntu

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,920
which a lot of people sort of have

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,800
suspicions about saying oh you have this

00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,300
proprietary fork of linux and

00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,429
essentially all the tears is an

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,160
internally supported version of ubuntu

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,410
it's kind of in some ways I'm actually

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,600
kind of sucks because it's behind the

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,820
external version of ubuntu in many ways

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,800
which is why i'm i'm running the

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,510
external version of ubuntu on this

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,750
laptop because the animals the wireless

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,760
whereas gulberg do didn't but it's the

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,370
version that the engineering the the

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,080
engineering support staff actually are

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,910
happy and comfortable supporting and

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,880
pushing out on the production machines

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,380
essentially and we like people to run

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,570
good one too because we're eating our

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,350
own dog food that's the software that

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,190
we're going to be running on the

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:52,730
production machines for instance the

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,559
languages and compilers GCC you know

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,110
many people are running Linux and

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,800
there's a repository within Google where

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,510
all the code lives and all incoming open

00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,630
source software is tracked in there the

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,850
license requirements are evaluated and

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,550
everything is completely and extremely

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:13,250
well controlled there's a really really

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,910
good process around importing software

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,890
into that

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,980
sorry we've actually given talks

00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,890
specifically induced on that process to

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,240
commercial companies to teach them how

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:26,240
Google does this because it's it's done

00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,150
so well one of the interesting and nice

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,400
things is that if an important piece of

00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,810
software it had actually has to go

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,330
through it essentially a build process

00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:38,470
to be imported and if any of the

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,760
checklists on that bill process fail

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,200
then essentially the people who are

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,780
using that software as part of their

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,370
build their build fails and they don't

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,270
get binaries out until they've corrected

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:52,520
whatever license problems or whatever

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:58,430
they've run into so it's extremely well

00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:03,890
done so why do we do this why not you

00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:05,060
know do google OS well because doing

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,820
google OS isn't Google's business

00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,170
Google's business is organizing the

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,300
world's information and making it

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,730
universally accessible and useful not

00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,800
writing an operating system and so

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,170
taking an open-source operating system

00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,940
and making it do that is a far more

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:24,260
efficient use of the resources that we

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,810
have so the other thing and I can't

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,440
stress this enough the other thing that

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:32,780
it does for us is it gives us complete

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,970
independence from other people's

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:38,300
schedules other people's you know

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:41,690
release release schedules other people's

00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,850
licenses anything that goes wrong on the

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,640
Google production system google has a

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,070
source code to go in and fix it and have

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,570
the engineering talent to do so and if

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,820
it's a piece of open-source software and

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,740
it gets fixed we give that software back

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:59,330
and I'll talk about that process in a

00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:02,210
little bit so if Google wants to do

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:05,480
something different from everybody else

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,210
you know we have the ability to do that

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,040
we're not beholden to any third party

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,350
software vendor to make the changes that

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,220
we need to do in order to make the code

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,970
work

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,950
and that's extremely powerful and it

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,320
appeals essentially to the Google ethic

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,700
which is to try and give back and try

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,400
and work with the community rather than

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:32,090
build proprietary things ourselves so

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,669
see so theoretically I could finish the

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:37,280
talk here I mean just by using the stuff

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:39,710
you know even making internal changes we

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,140
comply with all the licenses you know I

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,450
this could be a talk on how to build a

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,789
great business by using other people's

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,730
open source software right I could just

00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:51,890
finish here but that wouldn't be as much

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,120
of a fun place to work I wouldn't want

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,669
to work with a company that did that

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,070
they would essentially be seen as people

00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:59,600
who take rather than give back and so

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,789
this is why I'm in the open source

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,429
program office and this is why you know

00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:05,480
I like talking about this stuff so what

00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,270
I'm going to talk about now is how

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,409
Google gives back on what we do and why

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:17,140
we do it and it's extremely well thought

00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:19,970
out so we did a lot of things in the

00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,730
open source program office but most of

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,890
what we do is basically we help the

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:28,730
engineers do what they want to do and

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:30,590
help them avoid any legal issues so if

00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,110
somebody wants to open source a piece of

00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:35,690
code in Google it's the most streamlined

00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,640
process I've ever seen I've been in

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,380
other OpenSocial review board accent on

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,960
them I've been the token engineer in a

00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,090
room full of lawyers you know reviewing

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,309
what somebody wants to do essentially

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:50,030
within Google you send an email to the

00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:51,740
open source program office saying I want

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:56,090
to open source this piece of software it

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,110
does this and you know we'll look over

00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,789
it will make sure we'll give a

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:02,570
recommendation on the license that they

00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:04,280
should use but it is up to them will you

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,049
know we'll make sure there's no issues

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,470
with using other people's code or

00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:13,150
whatever and mostly we don't talk to

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:17,539
legal we just say okay go ahead because

00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:19,220
people like Chris myself Greg I mean

00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:21,440
essentially been doing this long enough

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,429
that we know what works and what doesn't

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,159
and what you

00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:27,950
can and can't do so there's just a lot

00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,450
of experience in Google in actually

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,139
looking at these kind of requests and

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,419
it's it's really streamlined so a lot of

00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:37,549
the Google stuff gets released really

00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:39,710
really quickly with essentially just an

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:42,559
email to legal saying we're doing this

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,480
you know note that it's not an email to

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,379
legal saying we would like to do this

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,519
it's an email saying we're doing this

00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:51,499
you know and they don't have to respond

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,499
unless they really blow up for some

00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:56,869
reason we don't know about but so we do

00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:59,330
a lot of code release and we submit a

00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:01,820
lot of the changes that Google users

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:05,299
internally back out to the open source

00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:08,240
community ah you lost a lot of money in

00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:10,039
case you might have not noticed so one

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,019
of the things that we do is give

00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:14,899
donations to various projects now that

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:20,389
actually is less useful than you might

00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:22,009
think so I was at a party once in the

00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:24,919
middle of the dot-com boom in the heyday

00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:27,679
and I i ran into larry Augustine who was

00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,450
my boss at the a Linux a Lannister halls

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,779
and they came up to me and they said we

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,999
want to give you guys $25,000 as the

00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:38,179
open source as the linus torvalds award

00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:42,889
and to be honest i went please don't do

00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:44,659
this because well we don't we'd have to

00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:46,249
deal with tax we have nowhere to put the

00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:48,169
money the samba team doesn't even have a

00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:51,139
bank account you're going to make a set

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:52,490
all this crap up and I said what we

00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:54,409
really need these people who can write

00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,730
code and they said well we've got to

00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,940
give it to somebody and it's your turn

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,559
this year so this is why actually the

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,419
sandbur team has a formal existence

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,669
because of that bloody 25 thousand

00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,049
dollar donation that we didn't want so

00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:08,690
we had to set up a bank account we had

00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,460
to deal with taxes this eight probably

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,129
months of time that we could have spent

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:17,450
coding anyway so money is less than

00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:18,829
useful and you might think so we do

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,770
internal license discipline as I've

00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:24,679
mentioned we advise on api's and

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:27,980
protocols participate in giving talks in

00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,500
places like this summer of code so

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,570
summer of code is is the Wonder

00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,950
the really new innovation that Google

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,770
has and I'll talk a little bit about

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:41,030
that later and we also participate in

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:43,370
the one laptop per child project so

00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,280
could release about a million lines of

00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,840
code more is coming all the time as you

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,389
may have noticed Google gears was

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,179
released today I didn't know about that

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:55,389
one actually because there's lots of

00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:58,340
code that just gets released without

00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,200
everyone having to know about it that

00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,810
looks actually a really cool thing I was

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,740
I was surfing the web and looking at how

00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,820
that works during some the afternoon

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,940
there's a lot of them I sequel

00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,110
replication stuff that's come out

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,830
essentially a lot of the internal tools

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,600
that we use a version of fuse the file

00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:24,410
system is user space has be important to

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:26,690
Mac let's see TC Malik a bunch of a

00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,790
bunch of large-scale performance tools

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,070
that Google uses internally have been

00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,440
made available one of the reasons for

00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,660
doing this is it's really helpful to

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,690
have these technologies out there that

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,070
people use so that because Google does a

00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,140
lot of hiring from the open source

00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,880
community so that when people come into

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,840
Google they already know some of the

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,460
things that they're going to be using

00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:52,460
and working on so that's very very handy

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,530
the other thing we do is provide project

00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,420
hosting and this actually is that this

00:35:54,530 --> 00:36:01,220
actually is a submarine way of reducing

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:04,880
license proliferation so sourceforge is

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:09,230
the largest code largest project hosting

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,940
site code google com is is second and

00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,260
that's absolutely fine we're not trying

00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,140
to make this you know the world's

00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,510
biggest or best code hosting site one of

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,910
the nice things we do with with the

00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,650
project hosting is that we restrict the

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,750
number of licenses that you can choose

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,370
when you're creating a project so you

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,560
can't sort of come up with you know

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,060
Jeremy's license of the day and say oh

00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,860
it's an open source license and I'm

00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,470
using this you have to choose a

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,450
restricted set of licenses so all of the

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,820
projects under there have an own set of

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,620
licenses that you know we already know

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,480
whether we can deal with and it does all

00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,220
the things that you

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,560
spec like you know version control

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,690
source code control which is all this

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,420
town of things many many thousands of

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,900
projects on there I have no clue what

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,060
they all are and of course the open

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,740
source tools that we use internally and

00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,010
the open source projects that are

00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,950
created internally we give the code back

00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:06,010
and we keep the it up to date and this

00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,980
is important and the reason you know

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:11,050
this is enlightened self-interest

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,270
because in keeping these projects up to

00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:16,570
date and giving the patches away what

00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:18,580
this means is that Google doesn't have

00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,940
to maintain a separate fork a separate

00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,790
branch of these of these projects you

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,800
know obviously we try and work with the

00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,920
project leaders and the the project

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,630
managers to get the patches I accepted

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,670
you know hiring Andrew Morton was a main

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,350
you know one of the main goals for doing

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,050
that with Linux to get the google

00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:42,150
changes for linux into back out into the

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:44,920
community back out you know so that

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,780
essentially they they don't we don't

00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,380
have to maintain such a private version

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:52,990
of Linux one at one of the main one of

00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,210
the main changes that was made in in the

00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:58,930
Google Linux for a while was essentially

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:03,100
back port of two dot 6 feature's 22 dot

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:04,480
4 so this is one of the things that that

00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,490
didn't really get released and people

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,260
grumbled about that a little bit but

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,730
essentially if you're running we're

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,380
trying to face those machines out and

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,630
machines running to dot 6 already have

00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,490
those changes so as you can see there's

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:19,240
just a whole host of different projects

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,920
like the person asked about GCC yes we

00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,050
contribute a lot back to that obviously

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,260
I write lots when I'm not on the road

00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:29,700
giving talks are at lots of Kota samba

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:32,140
so let's see oh this is embarrassing

00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,900
yeah as I said that my bosses slides so

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:39,250
he's put me on here so there's Andrew

00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:42,010
Vito Greg and myself listers named open

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,840
source developers but essentially with

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:48,640
you know we're obviously hoping to

00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:51,190
expand that as much as possible and you

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,720
know coming on board essentially I'm

00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:57,369
I can just speak myself on this you know

00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,250
the goal was keep running the project

00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:02,079
keep contributing to the project don't

00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,720
you know sort of coming to Google and

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,970
disappear keep maintaining an external

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,430
profile keep working on the code keep

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:13,240
making it work for everybody as well as

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,730
Google internally so it's a very good

00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,829
place to do open source code so let's

00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,839
get to the Summer of Code so the Summer

00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:25,240
of Code came about because you know

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,530
Chris essentially he's been around in

00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,079
the open source community a very long

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:32,230
time he knows that throwing money at

00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:35,170
projects essentially doesn't really work

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,050
I mean there's some fuss in debian at

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,010
the moment from trying to have some fun

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,589
developers and other people are

00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,750
objecting to this so just just giving a

00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:46,050
project money can often do more harm

00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:50,020
than good what projects really need is

00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:54,280
good code so how do you get good code

00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:57,970
well idle students idle students are

00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,349
perfect targets for creating code they

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,450
got nothing better to do during this

00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:03,430
summer as a wonderful quote somewhere on

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:08,310
these flights saying get them flipping

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:12,220
bits not burgers as their summer job so

00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:14,410
the the way this works is essentially

00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,670
projects come to Google with here are a

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,510
bunch of things that we would like

00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:22,450
people to do students apply for that or

00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:24,550
come up with their own projects Google

00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:27,040
essentially filters them comes down you

00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:30,099
have to have mentors it basically gets

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,400
boiled down so summer of code 2006 had

00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:36,069
about 600 students in 90 different

00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,400
countries all creating or creating

00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:40,780
open-source software and one of the

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,300
other things that we're doing with

00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,040
summer of code is what as we're getting

00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,079
these students to create the code we're

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,000
making the members of the open source

00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:54,220
community so for example the last person

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,190
that we recently made a member of the

00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:59,050
samba team we discovered came across and

00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,450
started working with us through summer

00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,700
of

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:05,430
so it's a way for projects to get new

00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,309
talent coming in open source projects

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:11,490
get new talent coming in and helping yes

00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:13,980
how many students are actually applying

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:16,770
for positions in summer of code I

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,369
thought that would be more subtle would

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:22,020
be more students than 630 so the

00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:23,339
question was how many students are

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,220
applying for summer of good this year

00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:32,760
yeah and how many students are applying

00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:34,680
out of whom tho 630 are accepted um hang

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,150
on a second I think those numbers might

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,299
have been on the previous slide let's

00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:48,029
see yes so as you can see there that was

00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:51,210
for 2006 so there were 6,000 oh so 3044

00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:55,170
applicants and we ended up funding 630

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,609
yeah okay so yeah I mean they it's not

00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,779
like you applying you automatically get

00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:01,589
accepted because we're going to pay your

00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:03,359
money so you know you have to that

00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:04,680
basically the mentors have to approve

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,270
what it is you're going to do and

00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,069
there's only a limited number of places

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,869
but it's actually gone up this year i

00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:12,240
think it's it's gone up from 600 to

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:16,980
about 900 this year but the numbers are

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:20,130
on a later slide okay thank you okay so

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:23,670
how does it work so student applies to

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:26,190
work on let's say apache and you know

00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,740
the apache software foundation reviews

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,289
the application decides to accept the

00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,609
student there's only a certain number of

00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:36,690
places obviously because there's a

00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:40,260
limited pool of cash so we pay them for

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:43,140
being accepted they create a project

00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,420
with the mentor halfway through they get

00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,520
two thousand dollars when they finish

00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,890
and they've if they've completed the

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,319
goals that they set down and it's also

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,029
the goal that the job of the mint is to

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,520
make sure that the students don't sort

00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:58,200
of go crazy like you know sort of okay

00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,000
we're going to write a complete new

00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,309
sequel server that all take on oracle

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,240
you have to help them set realistic

00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:07,470
goals that they can actually achieve and

00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,930
they give another two thousand dollars

00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,970
so it's reasonable

00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,800
significant and you of course you get a

00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:16,579
t-shirt at the end of it which is

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,470
extremely valuable we learned in Samba

00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,740
that you can make people do almost

00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:24,260
anything for a limited edition t-shirt

00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,569
so we have we have this we sell t-shirts

00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,460
with samba written on it but you have to

00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:31,040
be a member of the sandbur team to have

00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,660
the samba team t-shirt and that's

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,069
actually the only benefit you get from

00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,839
being on the samba team you should get

00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:38,180
the t-shirt that says team on it but

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,040
people people give us thousands of hours

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,470
of coding work to get that t-shirt say

00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,940
hey it won't it certainly works and

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:47,030
obviously you get very valuable

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:52,099
experience along and probably a

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:56,000
certificate too yes so here's the

00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:59,780
geographic breakdown for 2006 so the

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,980
u.s. is the largest I don't know whether

00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,809
that's because they have more computing

00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,329
science students probably just larger

00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:08,240
population more active internet access

00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:11,839
interestingly enough Germany is a very

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,220
very large free software hotbed go

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,890
germany and there's a lot of students

00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:21,740
coming from here which is very very good

00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:24,200
and then as it tells off i think mostly

00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:29,720
it's to do with lack of internet access

00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:32,150
lack of opportunities so the educational

00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,059
distribution as you might expect you get

00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,349
more undergrads than PhD students mainly

00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:39,380
because the undergrads have more time

00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:41,450
and aboard during the summer but you do

00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,040
get you do get some people with advanced

00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,680
degrees coming on and working on this

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,910
because hey they must be poor too and

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,440
the other thing that I found really

00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,170
interesting i didn't know this before

00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,660
joining google is that it's not just

00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,700
computing science students who apply and

00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,530
get accepted and actually do work there

00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,900
are people in you know english

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,130
literature who are actually decided they

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,770
want to write code as a hobby or

00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:06,020
something and they're going to accept it

00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,849
and become you know in all these various

00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,290
different disciplines they've become

00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:11,120
successful in

00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:13,310
in the summer of code and we turn them

00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:18,290
into free software developers haha it's

00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:19,940
our evil plan so what do we do this so

00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:23,540
as I said there are here's the wonderful

00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:26,180
quote flip bits not burgers and you know

00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:29,930
it is enlightened self-interest on

00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:32,810
Google's part because Google is not just

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:36,080
a consumer but a producer of open-source

00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:38,210
software and the more open we can keep

00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,090
things the more open we can keep the

00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,740
internet essentially the more people are

00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,260
writing code out there that run over the

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,490
Internet and essentially just creating

00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:50,960
more open standards he's good for google

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,840
not only are there people that we want

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,670
to work with their people that we hire

00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,780
and essentially growing the developer

00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:01,100
base grows the internet and grows

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,050
essentially grows the economic activity

00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:06,800
for everybody so it's actually very very

00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,620
good for google it's a great way for us

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,880
to get contacts with educational

00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,700
establishments you know because because

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,130
Google isn't that big in terms of in

00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,290
terms of people so it's a great way to

00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,810
actually get contacts with universities

00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:23,000
that we wouldn't otherwise get to talk

00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:25,730
to and maybe get to talk to them about

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,980
you know some of the computing science

00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,590
curriculum that they're doing there's

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:34,130
actually my officemate is very involved

00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,840
in educational users he's actually he's

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:39,590
actually trying to find spare google

00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,510
machines to create clusters for for

00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:46,580
university students to practice some

00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,720
real large-scale coding on yeah I won't

00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:51,380
mention any more about that he's doing

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,180
the PR on that yeah and it's a great way

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,550
for open-source organizations to

00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,770
actually get new members get new blood

00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:00,110
coming in writing new code as I said

00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,570
 has benefited enormously from this

00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:05,420
many many other organizations have of

00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:08,360
course you know some students fail some

00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:10,280
organizations fail to mentor so you know

00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:13,070
there's some filtering going on at the

00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,680
Google we have people who track the

00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,300
metrics on whatever everybody has done

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,610
and

00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,040
how everybody's doing and and so you

00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:22,930
know some some organizations not going

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,480
to accept it some organizations do

00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,680
events depends how they've done depends

00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,740
what kind of projects they want to do

00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,740
and as I said we hire from the open

00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:35,890
source world so here's actually the 2007

00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,930
distribution of the s I don't know that

00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:42,070
you can see that the SF for students and

00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:45,240
the EMA fermenters I think I think I

00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:48,510
knew Samba team guys on here somewhere

00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:52,840
hey is anyone in this room on here

00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:54,910
anyone know cool oh well if you're if

00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,250
you live in Germany then you're on here

00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,050
because I this is one of the google maps

00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,080
thing is that that there should have

00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,640
been green line showing between mentors

00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,710
and students but i couldn't work out how

00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,880
to do that but hey you're probably on

00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:12,160
there so this is very cool so as you can

00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,290
see it's spread over this is an

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,390
interesting thing to look at if you've

00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,280
got google earth there's the URL where

00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,690
are we I don't know what these finds are

00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,670
going to be available but if you load

00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,910
that URL into Google Earth you will

00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:27,430
essentially see all the people who are

00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:29,020
participating mentors and students in

00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,090
Summer of Code this year spreader out

00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:36,310
the globe see you can look at it to your

00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:40,840
heart's content so as I said we've got

00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:43,630
900 so students 130 organizations and

00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:46,690
there were six thousand applications and

00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,580
oh coding started about two or three

00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:51,910
days ago so i will expect our first

00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:54,880
check in soon yeah so it's extremely

00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:57,310
useful this i think it is is probably

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,900
the thing I'm most proud of I mean

00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,850
Google engineers do a lot and give a lot

00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:04,420
back but summer of code is something

00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:06,310
absolutely unique that Google does that

00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,640
we created that is really really cool

00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:11,800
and you know I I don't know anyone else

00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,320
who's actually growing the open-source

00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:17,670
ecosystem in this way and it's one of

00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,670
the reasons I'm really proud to work

00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,830
so I think that's the end of the

00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:26,040
presentation yes so does anyone have any

00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:28,800
any questions or comments remember if

00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:34,950
you don't please use the microphone and

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:43,860
so we're just about on time any

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:46,610
questions comments complaint alright

00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,610
