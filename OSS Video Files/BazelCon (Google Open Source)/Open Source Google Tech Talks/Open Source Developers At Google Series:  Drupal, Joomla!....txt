good evening ladies and gentlemen and we

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,880
are pleased to have with us this evening

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,830
three students from the google Summer of

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Code program all of whom I know and

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,790
think you're absolutely fabulous miss

00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,160
Angela Byron with the Drupal project she

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,379
was a Summer of Code student in 2005 and

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,840
went on to be the program administrator

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:47,360
for Drupal in 2006 and here we have

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,420
laurens van der wit and hanas papenburg

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,540
both joomla Summer of Code students for

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,190
2006 so I'm gonna let these guys get to

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,690
telling you all about what their

00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,309
respective projects do a little bit

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,200
about the student perspective on the

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:05,680
program and then after that we have beer

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:08,960
and Dutch candy it's awesome okay

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,050
welcome everybody we are going to start

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,660
with presentation about content

00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:18,740
management systems in general and then

00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:22,430
about joomla and drupal in in the

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,920
specific area and later on we are going

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:30,270
to talk about our Summer of Code

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:35,670
projects and your first slide

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:38,250
so for us joomla guys lawrence yeah I'm

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,740
start with you I'll arsenal boots I'm

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,159
from Belgium and I've been terrific

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,039
student this is well Hannah's papenburg

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,890
and he's also a storm of grad students

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,259
and well since I think december this

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,240
year we have been invited in the

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,909
development working group of joomla

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,979
who's well actually doing the current

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:06,209
development of the upcoming release

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:08,640
cycles of jummah so yeah okay so i'm a

00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,310
student applied computer science in love

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,140
and in Belgium I've been in open source

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:19,260
since 2004 i started with memo which was

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,540
actually the previous tumor but because

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,040
of some problems we two three

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,849
tuna I'm graduating in software

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,950
engineering so basically just a big

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,599
bunch of programming and software

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,700
software development and web

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,609
applications and well my main goal in

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,310
juma 105 is implementing web services

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:45,690
and well extending the power of of tuna

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,120
in a horizontal way so that

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,870
implementation with our systems is quite

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,870
easy and convenient

00:02:51,790 --> 00:03:00,140
yeah i'm studying IT engineering and

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:05,480
physics in moon sets in western Germany

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:11,920
and I've been in open source since 2002

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:17,390
and not was memo or Joomla but with PHP

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:25,340
bullet board and I joined the ranks of

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:28,870
general users in 2005 and yeah I'm my

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,730
project was a user and access management

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,989
joomla is a bit restricted in that area

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:41,030
and when i when i joined joomla that was

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:47,140
my first concern so i started working on

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,140
that and cut to the project in the end

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,049
okay so what the agenda is for this part

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,090
of the talk is a first we're going to

00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,769
talk a little bit generally what content

00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,900
management systems are then we'll dig

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,760
into what joomla is a project in know

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,190
how where it stands and that sort of

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,870
thing we'll also get these guys to talk

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,169
about their Summer of Code projects that

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,120
they did and then at some point I will

00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,709
be jumping in to talk to you about

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,419
Drupal which is another content

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:19,870
management system so just so you can

00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:23,150
have a broader picture so okay so okay

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,000
so when we talk about this is chapter

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,460
one good one joomla is uh what's called

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
a content management system what that

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,520
generally refers to it can refer to a

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,070
lot of different things which is why

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,830
it's such a kind of a weighted word but

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,289
in general what it's about is making

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:43,460
your content all in a centrally managed

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:45,410
place so forums polls you know articles

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,050
all that kind of stuff in one spot where

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,580
you can administrate it centrally and

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,110
it's all dynamically generated as

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,970
opposed to back in the old days where

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,490
you had to make a bunch of little static

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,949
HTML files and if you wanted to update

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,840
the header to look different you had to

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,580
go into 15 different files and change it

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,530
it tries to eliminate a lot of that so

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,169
you can focus on what your site does

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,460
well which is

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,009
generating content rather than the

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,099
backend that makes everything work they

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,469
also generally very modular so you can

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:15,060
extend them to do event calendars and

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:17,219
knee commerce and all that kind of stuff

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,469
all from the same basic framework yeah

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:21,840
as well as templating you can will just

00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,340
basically switch a template and like two

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,389
minutes to generate the complete

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,789
different look and feel of your website

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,189
in a very well easy and convenient way

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:32,689
so it's also a friend were quite big

00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:32,689
purpose of conformational systems

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,580
okay so joomla I don't know if he goes

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,410
if you guys know member member c and s

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,330
well yeah memo actually was a

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,900
complimentary system which was released

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,640
by a commercial company so they put it

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,180
on the open source market with a GPL

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,280
license and because well last year we

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,340
had some troubles with the company so we

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,310
basically from from from embo to

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,920
Juna and well the complete core team

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,680
left juma and moved left left member

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,360
sorry and move to Joomla so basically

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,180
it's the same project with the same

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,110
thing but well just weren't a different

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,180
map a different name so joomla extent

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,630
the power of tuna in a horizontal way I

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,460
think that's a quite important sentence

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,680
that that described that describes

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,210
joomla joomla is all about extending

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,640
extending its platform and implementing

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,560
as many technologies as possible in a

00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,080
very convenient way so what does this

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,300
mean it means like implementing

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,270
interface suspicious such as web

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,880
services web dev very easily so that the

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,830
communication with other systems is very

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,510
easy that's not only for the for the

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,730
horizontal extension of joomla but as

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,810
well for the actual content it has to be

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,240
very very easy and very convenient

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,890
basically that's what what i doona is

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,710
all about is well it's already

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,930
simplicity so that's very important in

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,870
tumor

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,930
think first then react it's quite

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,750
difficult to get things organized in in

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,819
in a large open source projects such as

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,190
Juna therefore it's very important to

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,410
really start discussing and starts

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,360
communicating with with all the members

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,580
in in all development work and in all

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,000
the working groups and really discuss

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,770
the the items we want to implement from

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,479
from various perspectives such as

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,410
developments such as accessibility

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,570
documentation and so on so it's not

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,160
about just I have an idea and I want to

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,440
implement it now you have to really

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,160
discuss it and start communicating with

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,470
all the working groups there is there

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,500
are quite some challenges in in the

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,599
joomla open source project first of all

00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,729
all the different members the core

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,460
members and the D&D work group members

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:06,270
they're all over the place in the world

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,009
so for instance when you want well when

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,139
you have a developer who is living in

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,940
America here in San Francisco and a

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,789
developer that's living in Europe well

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,190
basically the guys in Europe go asleep

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,169
when the guys in San Francisco wake up

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,240
so it's quite a challenge to get

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,240
everything organized to work in

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,969
effective and well Purdue civ way so

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:33,149
that's well quite a challenge and we've

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:36,870
got we've got a forum and we've got

00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:40,529
mailing lists and we use IRC channels to

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,870
chat and it's yeah it's it's pretty

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,660
standard but it's it's just a matter of

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,670
good communication yeah if you have good

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,709
communication things well things will

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,410
work out on well you can work in an

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:56,290
effective and productive way that so

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,899
and well another challenge I'm a very

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,170
nice thing actually is that your get a

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:05,649
chance with people you've never seen in

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:08,199
joomla it's not well it's not a change

00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,420
when you're working with people that

00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:13,389
you've never seen for like one or two

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,639
years I mean it is the first time that I

00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:18,550
see Louis Landry's the lead developer

00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,800
it's the first time I met here in San

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,810
Francisco so it's really nice about this

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,240
project you work with these guys for

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,800
like a year you start developing you

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,250
really get to get to know them on

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
internet on skype on on IRC but well

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,110
once you just meet them it's very nice

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,540
and well just see the person in real

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,399
life that's also a challenge but it's

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,600
also a very nice thing of open source

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,600
projects a mighty thin so

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,089
to create an open source CMS in an

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,910
accessible way accessibility is life

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,220
these days if you if you have like CMS

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,620
that's very very powerful but that's

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,579
just not accessible users want to use it

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,069
because the main purpose of the cns of a

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:07,800
content management system is too well

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:11,490
just simplify the way of organizing data

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,230
and if the system where you well which

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,290
is basically fact around the data isn't

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,600
accessible the main purpose of CMS

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,309
systems it's just it's just gone so it's

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,499
very excessive it's very important to

00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:27,269
create an accessible way of providing

00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:29,370
the manner of well just a manual they

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:31,649
give it chance to the users to to start

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,360
integrating the data to start organizing

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:38,999
the data an advantage of joomla is the

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,920
easy interaction with with third-party

00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:47,069
systems and components the joomla CMS is

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,589
is built on a framework that allows you

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,059
to enter it very very easy at

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,420
third-party components for instance

00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:57,059
there's a large firm it's called as an F

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,220
it's just a third party form you can

00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,740
perfect integrated in June because of

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,579
its API so that's a quite take advantage

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,579
of the of the general API and well last

00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:11,309
thing is that well since the 125 release

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,980
cycle joomla has been completely

00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:15,870
rewritten and there has been a PHP

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,839
framework developed such as these and

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,120
PHP frameworks and actually Yuma is

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,639
built on top of this framework so for

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,069
instance when you take a look at joomla

00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,500
and you think like okay joomla is nice

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:30,209
but it's way too big for me you can

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,009
still use the application frame of the

00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:34,679
PHP application framework to just

00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:37,019
develop your own your own application

00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,629
without using joomla directly so

00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:42,480
basically juna is just an application on

00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:46,879
top of the on top of the frameworks so

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,879
that's quite important to know

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,600
okay about the the summer of code so

00:11:52,330 --> 00:12:00,280
Hannah's on I have been a student and

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,820
the summer of codes in 2006 and well it

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,850
was fun I mean you you write the

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,280
proposal you get accepted and you just

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,410
start communicating you start working

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,430
with all those current members and it's

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:18,940
really fun you get chances to really do

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,830
well to start working together with

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,750
others core members who get full support

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,110
from the core team you get appreciation

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:32,950
from the from the community it's a very

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:35,830
very fun a thing which was quite unique

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:39,040
in my case is that I had a life mentor

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,650
most of the googles of the Summerfield

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,260
students had a mentor which they had to

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,690
meet over over the internet so they had

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,510
to make an appointment apartment and

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:53,140
then starts communicating over RC /

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,210
skype / what doesn't matter the

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,480
advantage of a live mentor is that you

00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,460
just go see em you're sitting in front

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,920
of the computer and you start discussing

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,320
problems and I think that's a very

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,420
effective way of problem solving in the

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,150
summer of codes if you have a problem

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,760
you just look together to the problem

00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,700
and you solve it and that's a very big

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,700
advantage i think if i adn't a life

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,640
mentor the deliverance of my project

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:26,020
with have well twice a small likely so

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:29,800
it's a really big advantage sorry don't

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,020
upon another word founders of the of the

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,850
google summer of code is that you

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,340
actually learn something when you go to

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,170
college for or university most of the

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,800
time you just get an introduction on

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:45,160
various subjects of well object-oriented

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,170
design and when it gets interesting they

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,080
have to switch subjects because if not

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,910
they're gonna run out of time when you

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,140
are doing the summer of code you're

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,450
really making

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,850
a piece of software that will be used in

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,980
a real-life environment you really have

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,070
to make sure that it's accessible that's

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,480
well the that it's bug-free that it

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,580
doesn't crash when you click on the

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,340
submit button and so on and that's a

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,590
complete different experience than just

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:18,320
making some exercises at college or at a

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:21,140
university so actually the motivation is

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,460
also completely different when you when

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,890
you create a project in the summer of

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,410
code environment you just create your

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,020
project and you know that it's actually

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,900
practical it will be used in the context

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,210
of the of the skin in the context of the

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,880
product which is joomla in our case so

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,310
the motivation and the perspective is

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,350
completely different than going to

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,510
college and making or exercises because

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,780
you know okay so I make those exercises

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:50,660
but well I'll be probably forgotten them

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:54,370
in three or four days so that's a

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,690
completely different parts of the of the

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:01,160
feeling you get with with the summer of

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:03,950
code and with well actually just to take

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,680
part in a open source in the open source

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:12,500
project um it's also good practice for

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,530
general team play and I mean when do you

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,670
learn in school or university to really

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:22,010
start a project from beginning like

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,790
planning what do the guys want out there

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:29,780
and what can I achieve in all this all

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:36,140
the time I have and what are the

00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:40,160
features of my code and some of code

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,940
really provided this area where you can

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,920
gain experience and yeah basically

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,260
you're just on your own when you make

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,750
some exercises at school there's still a

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,910
lecturer who well might help you if you

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,490
have some problems and there is like a

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,710
red line in in all those exercises when

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,590
you do a summer of code project it's

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,780
well ok make this piece of software good

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,490
luck with it so it's it's completely

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,490
different and well it's nice

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,860
okay maybe and watch it

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,949
I guess I'll do my spiel yeah

00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,230
good

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,510
okay hi I'm Angela Byron from the Drupal

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,940
project and today is December 24 anyway

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:37,880
so Who am I imma as I just said Angie

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,460
byron I was a summer code student in

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,340
2005 for the Drupal project and then in

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,610
2006 I got bumped to being a mentor /

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,320
project administrator for Drupal so it

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,110
was kind of a long way to go in a year

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,790
when I had first started with Drupal I

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,560
had never actually played with Drupal

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,510
and touched it I had heard about it

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,460
because of the spread Firefox project

00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,930
was running that as its back end and I

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,000
was like oh that sounds cool and then I

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,920
just kind of went on so when I was

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,810
looking for an out organization to apply

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,030
to that one grabbed me again because I'm

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,210
very interested in activism and things

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:14,540
like that so from there I've gone to on

00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:16,820
to be a mentor I'm currently employed in

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,400
a Drupal consulting firm called lullaby

00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,260
and they do websites for sony and mtv

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,960
and people like that that use drupal as

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,600
a back-end it's great because we get to

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,700
funnel all these corporations money into

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,040
making the platform better so you know

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,230
hey they need a module that does X great

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,150
so we'll throw that in CVS and get the

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,570
community so they can use it to and it's

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,490
a really neutrally beneficial thing so

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,960
see I started tech I started hacking

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,540
Drupal and doing open-source development

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,190
both because of summer of code now get

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,390
into more of my experiences with summer

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,430
coat a little bit later but that's

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,340
basically an introduction who i am i'm

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,850
from montreal so not that far away for

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:58,400
that whoo canada so what is Drupal

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,650
drupal's two things it's a content

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,650
management system so for regular users

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,450
it's a way for them to go into their

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,940
website and write an article or blog

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,440
entry or something like that and that

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,970
kind of stuff it's also a content

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,100
management framework so it's for

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,510
developers who want to they want to use

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,150
all the base features that Drupal gives

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,280
them like user management and

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,260
you know access roles and things like

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,120
that and they don't need to worry about

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,920
that they just build their technology on

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,640
top of it so Drupal is running things

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:30,070
like news publishing systems or like a

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,780
track or you know like some kind of

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,180
project management replacement there's

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,590
it can be used in a lot of different

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,680
ways just like the joomla guys were

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,720
talking about how they built in a PHP

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,600
framework that you can use so we're kind

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,810
of the same thing our focus is mainly on

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,270
architecture so everything has an API we

00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,190
have a form API we have users can be

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,590
manipulated we have basically anything

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:57,640
that's a thing in Drupal has some sort

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,800
of API to tie into it we also focus on

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,630
sort of bigger picture things like for

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,450
example Drupal supports multi site

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,910
hosting which you can use to deploy

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,860
Drupal to create a bunch of little sub

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,170
sites a lot of bigger companies like

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,760
that because they inherit all these tiny

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,510
little websites that are everything from

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,040
a static HTML webpage to you know a big

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,060
community site with forums and

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,890
everything and they can bring them all

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,380
under one centrally managed umbrella so

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,060
they like that a lot there's also a big

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,920
focus on extensibility we have what's

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,750
called a hook system so at any point

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,820
during the page lifecycle there's maybe

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,650
13 or 14 different places for you to cut

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,600
in with your own module and say yeah

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,210
instead of doing that do this instead so

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,580
it's kind of well written that way it

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,980
also has a flexible theme system just

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,990
just like we're talking about lawrence

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,570
was talking about it allows you to make

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,790
Drupal look like anything as opposed to

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,220
just a little three blocks sidebar thing

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,940
that it comes with out of the box it has

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,040
a small focused corso core is duma earth

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,690
I'm sorry Drupal out of the box is very

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,550
small and does basically only a few

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,740
things provide sort of library tools

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,970
that everybody else can use and then you

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,639
have hundreds of add-on modules that you

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,089
can stick in there instead

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:12,749
for doing extra stuff so here are some

00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:14,609
of the people using Drupal you might

00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:18,239
recognize a few names either Colonel

00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:19,889
traps one spread Firefox of course iBM

00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:21,719
has just written a whole series of

00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:23,759
articles on why they chose Drupal and

00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:26,820
they've got all kinds of cool articles

00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:30,649
about that sort of thing these are a

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,909
list of Drupal's 2006 our code projects

00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:34,769
we're kind of half and half as to how

00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:37,649
many of those have kept on as projects

00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:39,209
and how many of them haven't but a lot

00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,549
of those people have stayed on in the

00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:43,200
community to help with Corps hacking and

00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,519
stuff like that which is to me the most

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,919
important thing because those people

00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,549
become integrating the project and sort

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,179
of help out for life and then this is

00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,829
about my SOC experience so I was just

00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,639
graduating from Community College in

00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:01,559
2005 and I basically had no confidence

00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:03,450
in myself and I was like oh wow that

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,889
open sourcing sure looks really cool but

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,229
I would never be good enough to do that

00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,309
you know and sort of thought that was

00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,989
the way it was gonna go and I was just

00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,029
gonna get a job doing you know

00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:14,609
accounting packages and dot net or

00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:15,839
something so and like one of my

00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,579
instructors told me about this program

00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,229
so I was like okay well they're

00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:21,329
expecting people to be students so

00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:23,099
probably not like really wizkid people

00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,839
so I was like all right let me try so I

00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,759
basically lower the barrier entry so I

00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,099
didn't have to be as good as all these

00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,659
people ahead up on pedestals and so I

00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:33,719
applied and I got accepted which I was

00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:36,179
like what yes so ended up spending my

00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:37,529
entire summer working on Drupal and that

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,019
was a big challenge for a couple of

00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,639
reasons one was that I had never as I

00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,829
said it never actually worked with

00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,989
Drupal before but another reason is that

00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:47,789
in school they don't really prepare you

00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,950
for working with other people's code

00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,329
that's like cheating you know you're

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,820
supposed to just kind of coat everything

00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:55,529
from scratch and then you know so I was

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,999
really good at that stuff but when it

00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,440
came to getting into another project me

00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:00,059
like whoa what were they thinking when

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,249
they wrote this it was a little bit

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,839
tricky to figure that out and then stuff

00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:05,729
like version control systems we hadn't

00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,799
been exposed to stuff like working

00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:10,109
around different time zones and stuff we

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,520
hadn't been exposed to so here's a

00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:13,290
really it was an awesome learning

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,530
Arians and I got all kinds of things out

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:19,320
of that so now I went from zero newbie

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,150
person to now i'm on the documentation

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,270
team I'm on the security team i'm doing

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,570
Corps hacking i'm working with the

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,710
drupal association which is an upcoming

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,260
thing that we're using to centrally

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,440
manage some of the fundraising and

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,740
things like that so yeah and i get to do

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,660
this full time now and get paid by

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,370
corporations to kind of make duple

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,780
better so it's basically everything I

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,780
ever wanted and thanks guys

00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:59,609
okay so chapter two my google of google

00:22:56,129 --> 00:23:01,320
Summer of Code projects well a film as

00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:04,080
you might have seen the previous session

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,450
given by and by Lewis and we'll go the

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,039
Java xml-rpc application what's called G

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,289
explore but since there was some

00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,379
confusion about the name of another

00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,299
component that's joomla explorer we had

00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:18,210
to change it do assignment but it

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,070
doesn't are so basically excitement is a

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,749
desktop application that allows you to

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,869
administer the content of a to my

00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:26,460
website so what this means is that you

00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,529
just have an application you double

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,109
click on it and you get a nice graphical

00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:32,700
user interface a very native graphical

00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:35,489
user interface that allows you to

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:40,710
administer every single content item of

00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:42,359
a website it is built in a model modular

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,119
way which means that you can build

00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,219
extensions for it in Joomla you have yo

00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,960
we are also the ability to write

00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:51,269
extensions so for instance you have tuna

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,999
and you write an extension for a a

00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:57,089
weblog for a program and so on actually

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:58,979
siteman has those same abilities when

00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:01,679
you write an extension in June you can

00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:05,549
write the well the actually same

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,339
extension in incitement that allows you

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,869
to just administer that data of the

00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,539
tumor extension from a desk open

00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:15,839
environment and well the communication

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:19,979
is over xmlrpc so it's basically all

00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,950
about web services it is cross platform

00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:25,529
which means that you can run it on any

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:29,039
platform you want such as neck windows

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:32,969
linux solaris and one basically every

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:36,739
single platform you can imagine it is no

00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:39,779
best games which means that well every

00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:42,089
every item every content item a weapon

00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,710
link an article will be treated as a

00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:46,619
note and you're gonna add some

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:49,799
characteristics do that noise one of the

00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:52,440
problems we we have in tuna and which is

00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,769
actually a little gift week as for memo

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,700
is that we can only create like like

00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:00,460
three levels in in

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,470
in the indie content not a Taunton

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,450
component so for instance you have a

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,600
section you have a category and you have

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,299
an article that's it you cannot make

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,260
more levels in the in this date

00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:16,539
estructura so in incitement I developed

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,880
a data structure with which basically

00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:22,510
allows you to nest as many items as you

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,059
want an MBS is also planned for joomla

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,120
to toto and the advantage is that you

00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:30,039
can just take the NBS from juma and dump

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,789
it right into sight when so you don't

00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,649
have to go for it all the all the actual

00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:37,269
items when to not do and now it's and so

00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:39,309
on you just take the structure and you

00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:42,000
dump it into into joomla it will be a

00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:45,850
quite well quite huge boost of

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,230
performance yeah it's of course open

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,169
source software it's really strong with

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:54,909
the common public license and it uses

00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:57,610
web services so basically when you start

00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:59,470
up sighs man it starts gathering the

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,230
data format human our websites using web

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,820
services so it's make a connection to it

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,399
makes a connection to the server and

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,380
over XML all the data is gathered from

00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:12,059
all different in June our websites

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,450
websites a few well decides to use that

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:18,899
I'll give a demo think that will be a

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,899
bit cleaner than

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,399
so actually the nice thing of of Google

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,740
is that they also well about the Google

00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:32,649
Docs which is widely is that they also

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,559
implement a xml RPC interface which

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:38,110
allows you to basically push content to

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,830
every CMS that has the same interface

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:50,230
implemented so for instance a new

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:56,380
document so I love to program for

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:58,419
Microsoft so when you publish this you

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,299
have like publish to the internet which

00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:03,669
basically just generates a link but you

00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:07,240
can also public it to publish it to your

00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:10,510
blog basically this right this google

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,360
docs program has implement has

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:17,320
implemented the deep blogger api and a

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:21,070
blogger api is just a uniform set of

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,260
functions which any well CMS system or

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,990
blog application can implement so with

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,789
that if you have a blog application you

00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,289
can connect to any application that has

00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:33,570
the same blogger interface implemented

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:40,269
so just have to check my blocks my

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:43,049
settings yeah although so it's my own

00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:46,960
server it's basically just the the URL

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:50,139
slash joomla / xmlrpc which is the

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,290
location of the xml RPC server so just

00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:54,320
contestants

00:27:52,290 --> 00:28:00,080
ok

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,880
so if i push okay and post it well

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,090
actually i'm just going to refresh this

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,090
one

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,180
okay so these are just the articles on

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:17,640
on the Joomla website so when you push

00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:20,190
this to to a drama website okay the the

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,500
article basically just gets posted from

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:26,220
the from the google doc server to my

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,450
local drama installation at least it

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,450
should so

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:41,810
yeah it should okay hear this so using

00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,150
web services using xml RPC this document

00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,770
has been published do it to a joomla

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,850
website which is a complete different

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:52,730
location so but well there is something

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:57,290
wrong with the sentence so if i open my

00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:01,430
source code project and i just select

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:03,440
the indeed location as a server it

00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,960
starts loading the data from from that

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,840
website using xml RPC so basically all

00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,350
the data text into a xml and velocity

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,080
gets get sent over over HTTP and on the

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,910
client which is this one here on website

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,960
and well he puts it in a data structure

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:25,790
in order to do manipulate it so when I

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:29,100
go to the news and well let's just

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:34,580
change this one google

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,580
open-source officer and just save it

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,530
it should be modified

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:47,590
okay so I go so basically that's that's

00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,750
the thing of sidemen you you edit your

00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:55,240
website from a desktop environment the

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,920
the advantage of of this application

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,610
when you compare it to a blogger

00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:03,210
interface is that it's much more

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:05,950
extensible extensive than 10 bloggers

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,800
you can change the authority as you

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,060
create or the access level the

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,300
publishing data stop publishing things

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:16,240
and so on and basically this this user

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,240
interface is a is a copy of the backend

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:24,040
of joomla so it's very very common for

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,870
you my users also a nice thing of this

00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,210
application of well basically of a

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,940
desktop application is that you can very

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,640
easy easily implement offline editing so

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:38,290
for instance for for for web design

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,240
offices who who are well or quite often

00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:43,360
and playing their representatives or

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,370
like countries where the entrance is

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,120
very expensive they just create their

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,560
website and well once all the guns in

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,990
this prepared they just click on

00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,410
synchronize and other data get pushed on

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,850
the only joomla website so that's quite

00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,840
a big advantage off of this application

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,580
and auto advantages that when you are

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,130
editing your website and you have like a

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:09,400
very slow internet connection you just

00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,490
start editing click on save and select

00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:16,360
the next article click on save again and

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:19,540
it's it's possible that the process of

00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,200
saving the first item is still is still

00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,060
well it's still ex is still executing

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,510
basically all the LD queries are put on

00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:30,640
a stack and they're executed well sing

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,550
synchronously so you don't have to wait

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,260
until the process is finished when you

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,780
have a web application you have to wait

00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,670
until the process has finished and well

00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:43,300
after is finished you can start editing

00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:45,670
the the next content item or article so

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,040
that's also a quite big advantage of a

00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,270
desktop application is saying for image

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,169
management for instance when you have

00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,899
internal animation

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:55,450
and you want to insert an image you

00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:57,399
first have to upload it but it's quite

00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,259
hard to implement cropping and well just

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,389
optimizing of the image when you have a

00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,549
desktop application you can create like

00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:06,100
a small game for photoshop or something

00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:08,109
you implement cropping locally on your

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,629
machine you can use all the resources of

00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:12,879
your desk of application and once the

00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,980
the image is manipulated well this book

00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:17,950
when it's corrupt when it's optimized

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,749
you upload it over ftp which is also

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,179
implemented in joomla and you would just

00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:25,809
insert it so it is much more effective

00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:29,350
too well to use a desktop application

00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:31,539
with a CMS because of the well you can

00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,039
just basically use the power of a desk

00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:36,609
publication which is not the case

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,440
whether with a web application and also

00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:45,040
another thing which I forgot to show

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:50,190
that I'm not show this year

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,190
you can do gmail authentication so

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,970
@ gmail.com

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:02,350
so what it does is make a connection to

00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:05,110
gmail server and he is going to check

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:07,570
the user credentials so if he sees that

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,760
okay we have this year's when a data in

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:13,630
our database with this passwords if

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,150
that's okay give a give it or something

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:19,780
so that's also implemented in June and

00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:25,150
can be quite right you well in in the

00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:29,350
same in the same manner of same methods

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:31,270
used in incitement so you can use all

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:36,580
the functionality of tuna incitement

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:38,680
just by using xml RPC the last thing is

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,290
that well like i said everything is

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,120
modular everything is a plugin so for

00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:46,240
instance when you take a look we have

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,060
like like web links which is a plug-in

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,790
to manage web links with content which

00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,760
is the currently active active plugin

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:57,250
you see you have a user interface plug

00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,160
in which is basically the general

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,720
roughly out of a of this application for

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,310
instance when you have the tree on the

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,620
right side of the screen you just create

00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:08,350
another plug-in and you activate it and

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,540
everything will still work and the last

00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,399
weekend is the xml RPC you can also

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,140
change that for instance when you want

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,970
to have communication or for soap or

00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,820
over web dev you just create another

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:22,830
plug-in and the plugins such as web

00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,830
links and content will still work so

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,310
ok so that's about my summer for

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,310
projects

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:43,510
okay now about my some of code project

00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:46,929
it's a bit more theoretical than the

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:52,720
sideman project because yeah it was a

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:55,800
research project for joomla 2.0 and to

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,410
start with the current joomla

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,740
authorization system is a bit restricted

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:07,120
we have seven user groups these seven

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:10,180
groups yeah they all inherit their

00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,980
rights from the lower groups and they

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,480
are fixed you can't add another group

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:22,690
you can't move the groups in the trees

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:25,360
and yeah we have also three different

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:30,880
ways of checking of users allowed to

00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:34,210
access certain object and there is no

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,730
way to restrict two different groups to

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,640
different contents so I can't say this

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:43,180
group is allowed to view this category

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,700
of articles and this group is only

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:52,890
allowed to view the other group of

00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:55,840
articles and yet my project was about

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,590
researching in that area how to

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:04,330
implement it in joomla to point in a way

00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:11,410
that these rights can be set more

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:14,860
granular yeah the goats for my Summer of

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:17,580
Code projects were to implement the

00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:23,290
function of infinite groups in

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:27,490
completely random structures and to make

00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:29,480
the access rights each group has totally

00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:32,840
adjustable

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:37,060
and actually up till now you can't

00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:41,630
really say okay this user this group has

00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:45,980
write access to the content and this one

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:49,550
also is able to delete it and that it

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:56,090
doesn't have this Exodus rights on

00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:58,670
another content object so there the

00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:04,340
content should be much more integrated

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:07,820
into this yeah and one of the main ideas

00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:13,640
was to make this system exchangeable so

00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:19,160
in in the real implementation I used PHP

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:22,250
GA CL which is a free library and but

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:27,290
you could also write an adapter and use

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:34,220
ldap or mysql authorization and all that

00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:39,710
stuff whatever way you like it yeah the

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:42,560
achievements I said I don't have a

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:46,359
really fancy application like Lawrence

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,000
hairs but because mine my stuff is more

00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:53,630
inside of joomla and it's the

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,570
achievements were a class structure for

00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:01,220
joomla to point where we can implement

00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:05,600
all this a manager to add and delete

00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:09,859
these groups rearrange them and at users

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:13,940
to them and yeah the function headers

00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:21,100
for all the different for the API I

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:21,100
created and yes you

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:32,130
yeah basically what did I miss ya think

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,540
you want to take over here well yeah

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:38,580
that's basically a a last coat which I

00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,650
find really interesting as we are moving

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,599
to a world in which the in the 21st

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,280
century the most important activities

00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,250
that were this Akira not in factories

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,380
and not by any individual initiative but

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,020
in communities how together by software

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,240
and I think that's what open source

00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,730
software is all about it's about the

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,030
communities which work together on a

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:03,349
great application and yeah I just want

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,349
to end with it so thanks

00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:09,489
here we have for the drupal go again

00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:12,670
yeah I figured I'd let them kind of do

00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:14,619
their thing you know like but yeah so

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,190
does anybody have questions on any of

00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,190
this

00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,840
for you guys so what with your initial

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:27,830
expectation we went in to supper code

00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,660
well that's it actually we didn't know

00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,510
what to expect of the summer of cards it

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,550
was like okay so we get paid by Google

00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:38,410
to to work in open source software it

00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:40,910
will be fun so yeah basically it was

00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:43,220
getting a chance of working with the

00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:45,500
wittig our team of a of a open source

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:51,140
project and it was really hard to expect

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:53,600
what actually would be done so for me as

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,240
I said before I've joined the joomla

00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:02,950
team or the joomla project in 2005 and

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:07,160
started working with it and in March

00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:10,540
about much I was I thought it would be

00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:15,220
nice to implement this ACL management

00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:20,510
and this summer of code gave me a real

00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:23,120
reason to to start with this and it was

00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:27,800
a way to contact the guys from the team

00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:30,290
and it was also a first step just to get

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,300
a chance to get integrated in the actual

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,670
projects itself because of the summer of

00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,500
code because the invitation to join the

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,300
development working group and I think

00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,730
without disarm of codes this we don't

00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,890
have an impossible so that's also a very

00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:46,550
nice thing about this remark code yeah

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:53,780
it allows project projects like drupal

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:57,560
joomla and to the interview there yeah

00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:00,230
then you people yeah and and you can see

00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:08,180
okay they are capable of doing stuff

00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:11,360
they are intelligent and they yeah it's

00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,490
it's neat because you know so many

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,750
people come into this and they like they

00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,920
don't know what suspect even if you've

00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,240
been working with the project for a long

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,070
time you might not know what to expect

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,900
because it forces you to kind of go

00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,480
through it with different eyes you know

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,100
what I mean because you're you're being

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,080
you get to work with all these really

00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,610
cool people who are totally integrated

00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,890
in the project that you normally would

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,540
just know kind

00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,610
the mailing lists or stuff like that so

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,350
it gives you some one-on-one time with

00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:38,440
those it gives you a chance to really

00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,850
get integrated with the not only your

00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,920
own community but just open source

00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,140
development you know in general and

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,400
things like that so do you think you

00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,400
would have worked with the source

00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,800
wasn't for summer coat yeah absolutely

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,089
yes I would have tried I don't know I

00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,720
don't know I don't think I wouldn't have

00:41:55,089 --> 00:42:01,599
the confidence to try because I have a

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,640
very low self-esteem but it's a little

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,640
bit better now so so thank you again

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,540
what's that it's a lot better yes it's

00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:17,619
true what you can't see my hands doing

00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:19,030
nice Ryu so what was your expectation

00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,630
you're into it

00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,859
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,229
be sure to cover some of that review

00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:26,860
said yours very surprised that were

00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:29,230
accepted and

00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,060
so then so what were the next steps have

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:33,010
happened after this you got accepted we

00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,520
started working on Drupal to represent I

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,230
worked on a module to extend Drupal but

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,720
yea jus workin on Drupal was part of it

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,030
um in the next steps then we're kind of

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,650
figuring out communications and stuff

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,870
with my mentor he was in Germany and I

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:50,800
was in Canada so that there was a time

00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:52,900
difference there and also we drupal has

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,670
a to IRC channels and one is called

00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,140
pound rupal which is our development

00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,780
channel and the other ones pound drupal

00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:02,440
support for support questions and I made

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,910
the very big cultural snafu of asking a

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,360
support question in the wrong Channel

00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,620
and got flamed that I was like oh so it

00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,970
was part of it was learning like the

00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,630
cultural boundaries and things like that

00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:15,910
and and also just kind of meeting all

00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,490
the new people and it was really a neat

00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,810
experience because and I still do have

00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,400
these guys up on pedestals because I

00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,930
know they're really brilliant but it was

00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,040
neat because I got to see that hey

00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,410
they're really smart people ask

00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,330
questions to you know and it's not there

00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,950
there wasn't this huge imbalance like I

00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,840
figured that there would be you kind of

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,730
get that from looking on the outside in

00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,160
you you think all these people are gods

00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,960
they look at they've done this awesome

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,410
open source project thing and I'm just a

00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,510
weed you know and you get to kind of

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,940
experience working with them you know

00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:48,070
face-to-face over the internet and it's

00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,050
just it's just neat like you you're out

00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:52,000
the first time I was able to answer one

00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,190
of the core hackers questions I was like

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,860
oh cool you know and i found my very

00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:00,700
first bug ya know is this it was neat

00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:02,980
and it really it helped me kind of get

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,540
down to earth and like realize that hey

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,850
we're all just people that care about

00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,160
this project and want to see it go come

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,200
to life so I don't know were you guys

00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:15,070
that kind of the same thing that I found

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,260
yeah yeah when in the last weeks i was

00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:21,040
asked weapon by my dad a few times why I

00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:23,650
did open source because to him hey it

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,359
doesn't pay and it's a big waste of time

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:29,680
and all and I said

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:33,730
let's wait it'sit's experience and later

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:37,059
when i'm applying for a job here I've

00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:41,289
been developer joomla and all said yeah

00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:44,890
okay okay and now I've been invited to

00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:48,579
the joomla day in Germany to the joomla

00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:52,749
day in the Netherlands and now to san

00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:55,809
francisco and i doubt that i would have

00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:58,299
gone to San Francisco this year without

00:44:55,809 --> 00:45:04,509
being invited by google thank you very

00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:07,660
much and so everyone who says open

00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:10,569
source doesn't pay i'm currently on

00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,670
holiday here in san francisco would be

00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:14,200
even more well yeah there you go it does

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,509
pay but you just have to work some

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,489
patients so it's that's a nice thing

00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:20,259
about open source then it's not even all

00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:22,059
just about the green either it's it pays

00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,319
an experience it blows and learning to

00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,940
work with other people like just what

00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,170
you were saying earlier how like you

00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,799
didn't get a lot of teamwork and

00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:32,030
university right yeah so never what were

00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:37,460
your impressions of quality

00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:41,000
and what I'm sorry follow the code of

00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:43,820
your own car came in Hey look who I've

00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,460
got an object I mean compared to like

00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,230
when you can see as a student were you

00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,710
impressed that the code was high quality

00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:53,300
precedent over what are you depressed

00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:57,680
pretty bad quality how do you deal with

00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:03,590
a page in in joomla one point the code

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:06,590
is ok ok but in joomla 1.5 is really

00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:10,900
great and at the beginning when I

00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:15,080
started coding for summer of code it was

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:20,870
yeah my mentor wasn't really okay with

00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:22,940
it and he really beat it into me so at

00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:27,530
the end I think I learned a lot about

00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:31,520
code quality and the result was really

00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:32,960
good i think it's it's it's a joomla

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,850
standard in the Senate is really high

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,740
that's also a nice thing about open

00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:39,140
source it doesn't matter who you are

00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,670
when when you get in get in the project

00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:45,320
is well you really have to go and based

00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:49,100
on that go to get a reputation and

00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:52,670
that's not in light like closed closed

00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,560
code environments so I think well that's

00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,350
a really nice thing of open source if

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,780
you write very nice coat on and good

00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:06,310
coat you just get some appreciation and

00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:09,290
you well you get the reputation you well

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,540
yeah just get a reputation from from the

00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,400
quality of your coat so yeah so it's

00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,040
good incentive for people to write easy

00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,510
to read and you know efficient code and

00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,090
things like that I was pleasantly

00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:21,980
surprised with my project because they

00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,080
enforced stuff like you have to phpdoc

00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,760
all that just the same as javadoc

00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,250
basically but document all the functions

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,630
and their arguments and things and it

00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,340
was well commented there was a lot of

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,110
documentation others happy about that

00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,300
cuz i would have been you know otherwise

00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,550
but but then i've seen other projects

00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,350
that are like

00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,660
18 lines of regex and not a comment in

00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,280
sight and it's a little bit you know so

00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,550
it varies I think dramatically between

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,220
projects but so are you guys looking

00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:51,650
forward to being entered a seven or if

00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,900
you have a project 10 episode Emma Tori

00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,760
yeah yeah because it's such a nice

00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,190
experience just being part of this on

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,320
ref codes well I'm absolutely looking

00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:14,540
forward to to mentoring and I've

00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:16,880
students this isn't really sort of code

00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:20,570
related but why do you think there are

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,460
so many CMS's up there I think because

00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,840
everybody again everybody has their own

00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:28,010
idea of what a content management system

00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,930
should do yeah you know Jim was a lot

00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,790
better looking than gerbil out of the

00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,080
box I was amazed he was showing me the

00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,000
administrative interface and I was like

00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,280
oh there's like pictures and stuff it's

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,340
like cool where we were more focused on

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,820
like from out of the box we have this

00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:46,220
really basically there's we were talking

00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,200
about this to joomla zhou community is

00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,420
made up of a lot more percentage-wise of

00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,280
users then drupal's is drupal's is

00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,380
mostly developers so you tend to get

00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,270
these you eyes that are sort of passable

00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,190
but the functionality of the hood is

00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,750
really great and flexible and extendable

00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,580
and stuff like that where joomla is

00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,080
really focused on making the polish look

00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,450
sharp and they've done a great job

00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,770
making that look it's awesome and now

00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:08,540
they're kind of going hey we need some

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,970
of that flexibility in there too so now

00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,500
when you in Drupal herbs or in June 11.5

00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,690
it sounds like you're really heading in

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,270
that direction so well and actually when

00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:19,220
you have open source CMS they all have

00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,100
the same title but in fact are

00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,720
completely different for exact products

00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,090
Drupal is a complete different products

00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,030
than joomla actually you you can't

00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:30,680
compare those those two products so yeah

00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:33,560
well at their core they both manage

00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,140
content do it in completely commenters

00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,050
are very wise why

00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,480
right so it's very difficult to compare

00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:43,120
those two same with WordPress or we type

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,000
between there are just some different

00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,550
products better that have their

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,430
advantages and disadvantages so you just

00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:53,770
have to make a decision upon those well

00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:56,680
criteria so plus it's fun to write a

00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:59,470
content management system you know so

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,460
other things that Google never knew it

00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,870
is dealing with a lot of unstructured a

00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,970
content management system by definition

00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,170
it's pretty structure you have like you

00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,640
were explaining you have different

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:13,180
categories and sections are

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,470
whether your respective projects doing

00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:19,700
to deal with mr. data from large sons

00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,920
Drupal has a feature in it called

00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,230
taxonomy there's a taxonomy module and

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,019
with that you can do structured

00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:29,210
hierarchies how n length is deep you can

00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:30,799
do a flat hierarchy you can you multi

00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:33,769
select four categories and things that

00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:35,059
you can do tagging so they've really put

00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:37,599
a lot of thought around the

00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:39,799
categorization and structure of content

00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,329
every piece of content whether it's a

00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:43,160
blog or whether it's a pole or whether

00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:45,619
it's a forum post whether it's an album

00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,539
or whatever comes from a base type which

00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:49,490
is called a node so they kind of SAT

00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:50,720
back and said okay all these things what

00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,789
do they have in common they all have a

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,000
title they all have like a teaser and

00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:58,460
body they all have a create datetime

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,859
author let's pull that stuff into this

00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:03,740
core thing and then everything else gets

00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:05,720
added on externally so at its base thing

00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,910
everything in Drupal is a node which is

00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,400
one thing and then other fields or

00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,960
images or whatever pulled in extra

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,109
through the hook system so that's how

00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:20,869
Jubal's approach that problem yeah

00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:24,589
joomla is has some legacy with this and

00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:26,869
the old man boo system isn't that

00:51:24,589 --> 00:51:30,200
flexible in that area but we are moving

00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:36,970
towards that too so a node based system

00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:42,859
and 2.0 will be completely based on this

00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:46,519
yeah joomla just has a lot of modules

00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:50,299
like drupal and has to cope in that way

00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,920
with a random content so basically you

00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:53,960
just have to put your content into

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,460
sections and a section has some

00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,980
categories and in a category you can

00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:02,079
just nests on some articles which are

00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:05,990
just like a big wrench off of text so

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,089
but like like taking isn't isn't really

00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:10,980
really possible with Joomla I think

00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:12,750
that's also a bit none of the core

00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:17,210
yeah well the thing is possible there

00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:20,880
are extensions will do a session yeah

00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:24,990
but that's well yeah just a different

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:28,350
approach of joomla versus turtle Walter

00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,570
opolis in my opinion at least do police

00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:33,170
used for a lot of blogging application

00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:37,020
community sites and all that stuff while

00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:40,020
joomla is used for well very complete

00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:43,140
sites where you just manage the contents

00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:47,810
and just just leave the content so it's

00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,810
a bit a different approach than 10 true

00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,050
does that answer your question cool

00:52:54,070 --> 00:53:03,370
more questions come on yeah everybody

00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,710
does want beer does candy yes where the

00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:08,250
groups that you were joining has a sense

00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,250
of a Google

00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:19,519
oh my didn't get that did you in gym la

00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,690
they did the summer of code in 2005 too

00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:27,410
so I don't know what it was at that time

00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:32,289
but when i joined it was no problem and

00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:36,380
there were no i don't know these these

00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:38,509
conspiracy theories are such an joomla

00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,460
is really open yeah i mean they're

00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:42,289
definitely what I saw that on like the

00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,789
administrator mailing list and stuff

00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:45,559
like that but that was just bizarre

00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:47,329
everybody that I knew from whatever

00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,979
project it didn't matter was really just

00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:50,960
grateful for the opportunity because

00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:52,819
they could see far term like this is

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,499
great it's going to help strengthen open

00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:56,150
source and if you guys got some

00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:57,589
complicity out of it was like good you

00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,630
know like you should because you're

00:53:57,589 --> 00:54:02,539
throwing money yet into this great

00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:05,509
ecosystem and stuff so i don't i know

00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:07,249
there were people that were looking for

00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:09,499
the ultimate agenda and things like that

00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:11,390
photos you always have those kind of you

00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:12,739
always have those people but i think

00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:18,729
they are a few and far between in

00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:18,729
general my agenda was really

00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:28,550
classmates at me why just had graduated

00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,920
so I didn't really have any classmates

00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,330
but but just before I had entered summer

00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,980
Kota got in a big argument with one of

00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,330
the guys about he was i was saying i

00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,830
wanted to program open source and he was

00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,690
like you'll never get paid doing that ah

00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,870
you know this kind of stuff and i said

00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:43,040
yes i will somehow and then this ended

00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:45,860
up happening so i should go find him

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,230
again soon with me it was when i when i

00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:50,300
first got into open source was ok yeah

00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,460
open store it's nice but you can get a

00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,950
living with it and well past week when i

00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:00,860
said i got the opportunity to go san

00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:03,830
francisco's was like okay so yeah it's

00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:12,370
really fun in the end similar with me so

00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:12,370
yeah they really and we know okay

00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,090
Oh

00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:22,730
I just wanna join as an

00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,730
some recur 2005

00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,630
people's reaction is its first of all

00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:34,090
wow you spend your summer doing that how

00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:36,070
dumb I did nothing yeah that's that's

00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:38,230
the first stage of the reaction and then

00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:41,350
the second stage was after I now

00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:43,960
intergroup so second stage was after I

00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,370
got the internship at Google partly

00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,300
because I already you know the people

00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:53,740
from some good then it was I hope yeah

00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:55,330
maybe I should have been that team and

00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,940
aside from that well that's that's the

00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:01,950
base reaction people who going go into

00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,950
software because pays well

00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:08,170
none of the other people just find finda

00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:11,280
fantastic and most of those who did by

00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,280
the fantastic went

00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,450
it's all about getting the passionate

00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:19,730
people who like live breathe this stuff

00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:22,270
and yeah it does a good job of ferreting

00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,270
those people out

00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:30,390
oh I like every moment I seem speed

00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,100
before I have to disagree with the

00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:34,670
statement there because open source

00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,930
offers all about individual initiatives

00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:39,060
individuals contributing and await their

00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:42,360
comfortable

00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,980
well Evans a very smart man don't mean

00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,869
under my

00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:56,510
my own experience with open source

00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:59,930
software and will incorporate but how

00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:02,540
many open-source projects survive that

00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:04,550
are only depending on one single person

00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:08,990
so it's always to the community that

00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:11,420
pushes forward and collection of

00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:13,760
individuals right yeah yeah but it's not

00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:16,220
it's much with the enforcement an

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,369
amorphous blob of community pride its

00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:24,580
people it's that would deal through the

00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:24,580
 question I think it's a Susumu I

00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,460
would agree with that yeah I think

00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:31,130
that's true but I think that it's

00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,380
important to have that collective bunch

00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:35,300
of individuals doing stuff because if

00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,010
they didn't have that you just go and do

00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,869
your own individual collective thing

00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,750
over here they wouldn't have those big

00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:44,420
open source projects such as well I'm

00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:47,619
sorry people have people doing stuff

00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,619
that they also

00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:54,330
my point exactly

00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,700
hey Margaret
