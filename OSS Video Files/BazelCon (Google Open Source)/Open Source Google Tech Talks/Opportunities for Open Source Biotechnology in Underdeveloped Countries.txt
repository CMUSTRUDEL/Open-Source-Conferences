ABSTRACT

Guido D. Nez-Mujica will be presenting on Science, Innovation and entrepreneurship in developing countries, specifically in Venezuela, where he is from. He decided to stay there, instead of going abroad, to do some cheap biotechnology that is useful to people, solves unmet needs and allows us to use our knowledge for more than academic purposes.

The conditions there are very different from the conditions in developed countries. In terms of politics, as well as due to logistic and legal issues, some of those differences are drawbacks, while others can be treated as advantages. He believes that open source models could thrive in underdeveloped countries such as Venezuela and create successful examples of private initiative in places where the public sector runs almost everything. The presentation is less of a detailed analysis, and more of a personal perspective and account of the experiences in his lab with a current project: A kit for Chagas disease diagnostic, plus an overview of the general situation and the opportunities it offers.

it's my pleasure today to welcome Guido

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,390
Nunez mukha from the parasite enzymology

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,030
lab and he's going to be talking to us

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,390
about the challenges of innovation in

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,230
developing countries Guido thank you

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,720
very much well I like to speak in this

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,190
afternoon about the science

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,420
intrapreneurship and innovation in

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,000
developing countries but I would like to

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,280
talk more than about abstract issues

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,250
about my personal experience and how has

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,900
been for my laboratory to develop

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,970
diagnostic al kids all the problems that

00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,600
we have to endure and all the

00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,940
opportunities that we have had and what

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,720
we would like to do in the future so

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,270
this is not going to be like an abstract

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:21,030
analysis what more a personal story

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:24,900
thank you well first I'd like to begin

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,200
with this this graphics therefore UNESCO

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,469
show the proportion of papers published

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,939
in different areas according to

00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:39,240
different geographical regions it it is

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,810
clear that maybe sixty seventy to eighty

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,039
percent of the published papers come

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:50,880
from America and not North America

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:54,899
Europe and South Korea and Japan which

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,829
is here industrial Asia India and China

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,789
are considered in other Greek assault

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,229
regions and this these figures might

00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,469
have changed because they are like

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,990
almost in years old but I don't think

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,060
that besides China and India the trains

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:16,530
are now very different than than what

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,890
they were so this is telling us that

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,420
more or less like twenty percent of love

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,400
the population of the planet pretty

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,700
creates like eighty percent of total

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,849
research and this is outstanding and

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,120
there are a lot of reasons of why this

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:39,440
is this way

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,590
but even more shocking it's other

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,180
patents disparities according to the

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:50,629
income of the countries i have here like

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,450
high-income countries have almost 350

00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,430
patents per million people medium income

00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,019
countries less than 10 and low-income

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:02,950
countries have zero patents in the other

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:08,660
case we could we could see that even if

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:10,730
if developing countries produce create a

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,180
bit of science they at least do

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,760
something science and they publish and

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,890
they can work on scientific issues but

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,040
when it comes to technological issues

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,430
measure as patents they are not doing

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:29,629
really we are not doing really well well

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:33,379
of course this is a this is a bit bias

00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:37,420
because this is these are international

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:40,579
patents applications and patents are

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,030
expensive for people in undeveloped

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:47,209
countries well they are expensive even

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,000
for people here and you need in

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,370
universities special offices that take

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,329
care of that bureaucracy but we often

00:03:52,370 --> 00:04:01,340
lack those mechanisms in undeveloped

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:04,010
countries I think a question I would

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,379
like to consider here if is the number

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,510
of scientists is determinant if there is

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:11,840
any relationship between the number of

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:15,699
scientists per capita and the number of

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,639
patents and it's a tough issue because

00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:23,330
there doesn't seem to be a really clear

00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:29,630
relationship for instance South Korea

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:32,770
that is has a less than 3,000 scientist

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:37,070
per capita per 1,000 people excuse me

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:39,889
has a very much higher rate than other

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,250
countries that has more countries / cap

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:46,610
more scientists per thousand people so

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,440
that this is this is clear it makes

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,500
clear here that

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,200
there are a lot of social cultural and

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,210
economic factors that affect the rate of

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,090
patents per million people no it's not

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,090
it doesn't depend only of the numbers of

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,820
scientists in society and there are

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,910
countries like Finland for instance that

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,610
I didn't but Finland here in the graph

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:15,530
because the situation is much more

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:22,460
complex then they have like almost 6000

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:27,130
scientists per thousand people oh sorry

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:33,740
if that's a mistake per million people

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:38,090
excuse me see the mistake ah but the

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:41,780
important thing here is that it is not

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:47,180
related directly to the number of of

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:48,320
people then we can ask what is affecting

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,640
the production of technology in

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,040
undeveloped countries well happy answer

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,750
for that could be that most of

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,419
underdeveloped countries rely on

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:03,200
economies dependent of raw materials and

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:05,060
they are very little diversified for

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:10,610
instance my country Venezuela we rely

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:13,880
only in oil and several other minerals

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:18,470
that are raw materials we support we

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,990
lack even the most basic industrial

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,030
infrastructure even a bolt sometimes

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,850
cannot be built in Venezuela if we need

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,350
a special boat sometimes we have to ask

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:32,930
it a to another country even if labor is

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:37,250
cheap in Venezuela industrialized labor

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:40,580
is scarce most of labor forces in the

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,100
services sector other countries rely on

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,100
agriculture and what what happens with

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,260
this that raw materials can be extracted

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,180
with very few technology that is very

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,990
specialized for instance after the

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,340
political problems that we had in

00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:01,280
Venezuela many of our oil engineers were

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,040
fired by our government and they easily

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,250
found

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,150
work elsewhere in and foreign companies

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,750
so it's not that the quality of the

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:16,070
human resources in undeveloped countries

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:20,370
is not good or is inferior to the

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:23,010
quality of human resources in developed

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,570
countries well here we can see here at

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,170
Google have people from all over the

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:31,740
world things have changed things since a

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:34,290
lot of things a long time ago and we

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,600
have a better educational systems all

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,880
over the place but even 30 years ago a

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,160
lot of East Asians and South Asians were

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,870
coming to America and a lot of South

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,670
American people also we're coming here

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,830
and they proved that they were good

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,840
scientist we're good engineer so it's

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:54,390
not maybe it's not education what's

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,310
missing here a very important obstacle

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,490
to innovation here is lack of anything

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,380
industrial and technological

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:07,230
infrastructure for doing new things

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,450
things which are new it can be we could

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:14,420
be done here in America or in Europe in

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:17,550
a start-up are very difficult to do and

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,310
here it comes the personal experience

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,590
here is the check it the pains and joys

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,670
of innovation in my laboratory we have

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:30,660
developed the first one hundred percent

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:33,270
Venezuela and diagnostic al kid it's it

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,360
diagnosis chagas disease and as you can

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:41,180
see here we don't have like high-tech

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,979
facilities it's it relies heavily on on

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,690
monotonous work that may be here could

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,100
be automatic we don't have the resources

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:52,920
for that but as labor is cheap they're

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,220
even specialized labor we can keep the

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,040
cost down the check as disease is a

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,380
disease that affects around 20 million

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:07,160
people in Latin America and every year

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,800
100,000 people gets infected it is

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,160
lethal around three percent of times and

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,139
it kills people

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,810
around 30 years after the initial

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,089
infection the point here is that it

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,690
means people it makes it makes people

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:26,449
unable for physical labor like a long

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,240
time before they're dead so if they are

00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:31,189
pissants they rely on physical labor and

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,139
and they're sorts of think on depend on

00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:35,180
physical labor and when they can do it

00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,889
they be kind of born into a family and

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,459
they end up even poorer than they were

00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:43,120
before so this is a very nasty and very

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:46,639
important this is to in Latin America

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,709
current diagnostic methods are not are

00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,350
not good and they give cross reactions

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:55,399
when people have for instance

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,980
leishmaniasis or TV they could get

00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,620
wrongly a diagnosis of chagas disease or

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:06,339
sometimes the methods are not sensitive

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:09,769
enough to detect the disease so people

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,990
the people get a sauna whether they have

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,699
a medical condition that can kill them

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:20,480
and even if there are no pharmaceutical

00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:22,519
here's for the disease people can get

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,259
tango frequent frequency to the doctor

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,370
and get checking and get their heart

00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:32,810
checked so they have a better quality of

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,000
life we decide to create these

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,649
diagnostic kits because foreign kids are

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,009
of good quality but they are too

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:46,670
expensive they could be like a ten to

00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:49,639
twenty dollars per some per sample we we

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,670
created these diagnostic on kids and the

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,279
cause of every blood sample to analyze

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:59,240
every blood sample including labor is

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,399
less than one dollar although bio bio

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,000
chemical reagents are made in Venezuela

00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,600
the antibodies the recombinant antigens

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,939
are made in Venezuela but we had to go

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,769
through a lot of things to finally make

00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:18,470
this possible the kid is bigger is it's

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,899
being marketed this summer as I'm here I

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,559
suppose that the first units have been

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,340
shipped but it could be don't even last

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,730
the

00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,820
what happened that the easiest part of

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,800
all this was biotechnology it could be

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,900
maybe this is a more complex part

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,340
technologically speaking but things as

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:43,970
simple as these glass vials to build

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:48,050
them in Venezuela it was hell to get a

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:51,050
simple plastic box that contains the the

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,360
kid it was totally impossible it was the

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,090
last thing we keep to do why because in

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,590
Venezuela as I told you and that's true

00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,690
for a lot of countries in Latin America

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,720
and for the love countries over all

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,870
around the world we have no industrial

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,890
resources no industrial infrastructure

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:13,100
so even casting and you a new mode for

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,990
special plastic it's something very very

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,120
difficult there are there is only one

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,160
company that does it in Venezuela we

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,840
cannot go elsewhere because costs go up

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,700
and we have we're trying to keep this

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:29,660
cheap for people and for our government

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:37,190
so we what we have here is a situation

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:42,380
where know where the specialized labor

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:45,110
no specializes methods are not the most

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,440
difficult part of creating the startup

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:54,830
as the opposite here in America another

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:58,160
problem that we have is that regions are

00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:01,880
take very long time extremely long time

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,630
to arrive for instance at hear any of

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:12,290
you worked in the biological sector any

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:14,570
scientist here any scientist here how

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,710
many days if you are the region today

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,710
when you will have it

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,609
okay when we are there a region in

00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,939
Venezuela it can take as long as six

00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:32,399
months that's the average time if we are

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:35,279
extremely unlucky it can take nine

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,929
months 10 months it's very difficult for

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:44,790
us and this is not only because lack of

00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:47,519
free commerce and and customs and the

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,660
existence of costumes on taxes but also

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,749
because as the market for that is very

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,410
small and there are only very few

00:13:54,749 --> 00:14:00,749
companies who can who has the license to

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,609
export regions from America to other

00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:04,919
countries they have like a virtual

00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:09,869
monopoly and they don't offer good

00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:11,609
service they can they can they can be as

00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:15,209
slow as they want they can be

00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:19,410
incompetent and we have to buy things to

00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:21,720
them when we try to get around regions

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,759
by an online using an American credit

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,699
card and buying the region's to American

00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,860
than shipping us to Venezuela the

00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,470
company did a background a background

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,040
check in on the address we were shipping

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,379
to and they refuse to ship the three

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,100
unions the reasons were not dangerous

00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:45,959
bacteria was not evil a virus it was

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:48,959
pure protein from from milk from cows

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:53,459
milk that's it something as harmless as

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,339
that cool not bishop so then we tried

00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:59,549
with a person here in America for that

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:03,749
person to buy the yridians and then to

00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:06,209
get to the to his home and then that

00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:08,220
person will ship it was it could not be

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:10,079
done because they background check and

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,459
they found that that person is not a

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:19,049
biologist nada que me so they refused

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:22,709
finally we tried to we try to get a

00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:25,379
chemist but they did background checking

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,839
they found that that chemist was not a

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,869
working chemist so the reef finally we

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,100
gave up we had to go through the regular

00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:38,530
channels and we lost five months

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:40,930
of time and that's that's only one

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,520
sample of what's going on here what was

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,830
going on there all the time concerning

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:50,170
in the transit times it's very difficult

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:54,570
for us but in this part of that that

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:57,640
makes what my more creative we try to

00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:02,620
implement we try to create alternatives

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,540
so when we run out of a product we try

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,150
to explore other ways to achieve the

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:12,880
same result but as this has to be

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:17,140
standardized it we accept that we have

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,490
this result and we only we have set this

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,870
result that we have here and we only

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,210
purchase in advance and we try to

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:30,520
calculate when we are going to run off

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:33,570
reagents sadly and work a very

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,400
particular trait that we have in

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,220
undeveloped countries is that patents

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:43,930
and copyrights are not enforced this is

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,450
a mini mark and mini pilot movie market

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:50,310
and this is a rather small one from

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:53,080
things what I have seen it I've seen

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,870
stand with paranoia is more or less the

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,760
room of the size of this room filled

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,370
from top to bottom with a pirate movies

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,190
and no one really cares probably this

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:08,080
poll is there are only checking what are

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:13,000
they going to take for free so that is a

00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,370
problem when they fall in a well a

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,830
problem an opportunity for innovation

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,380
because if you issue a pattern no one is

00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:24,360
going to respect it no one is going to

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,820
honor it and you could get all your work

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,370
we replicated and they will not pay

00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,810
royalties to you here maybe because it's

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,990
very impractical we have a lot of

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,270
problems with crime we have a lot of

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,860
problems with a corruption so how

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,040
authorities are not going to pursue

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,340
patent violations it's science fiction

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,070
so we have to rely on secrecy

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:52,820
unfortunately but that also makes and

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,250
creates opportunity why because if we

00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:01,010
could share costs if we will create

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:02,870
communities of development as companies

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:09,350
know that the their patents are not

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:12,050
going to be enforced certain new method

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:15,800
or new machines could be used to build

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,800
new communities what are the

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,900
opportunities for biotechnology well on

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,670
there are lots of Roman needs in health

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,100
care livestock management and impede

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,720
humanity test for several conditions are

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,600
not cumbersome and expensive and

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,680
sometimes not apply it at all for

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,840
instance before our our kid was released

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:39,200
chagas disease was not tell it wasn't

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,050
test for in blood bank so there was a

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,770
small percentage of transmission of the

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:47,720
disease because of tainted blood a new

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,430
generation of cheap test will be adapted

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,530
immediately by public and private

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,900
healthcare systems as in fact happened

00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,550
with our kids out for ADIZ in hospitals

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,920
are waiting for a kid to in begin to

00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:03,110
implementing mandatory testing for blood

00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:05,990
for checking cc's as it is on ray 48 and

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,760
none other diseases currently test for

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,710
livestock diseases are expensive

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,850
inaccurate and slow results can take

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:16,940
weeks so farmers can the cows are just

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:20,420
going to die and the farmers will find

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:25,720
that this is the cow died like one month

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:29,120
after ricotta it's it's very it's very

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,400
slow and it's very ineffective so

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,460
farmers are have a lot of money and

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,460
they're willing to pay for new test one

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,230
good thing that we achieve with the

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,970
building with the creation of this check

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,860
it is that now we have our

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:48,860
infrastructure for biology and we have

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,410
we known how to make antibodies how to

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,010
stabilize antibodies and allow for

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:58,850
things if so we can create easily

00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:01,450
I know a kid's for another diseases you

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:06,590
only have to find the antigen which is a

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:09,890
rather rather slow process and can be

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,110
cumbersome but sometimes it doesn't have

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,920
to be that way so we have a lot of

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:23,200
though a lot of way already advanced it

00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:26,180
and if we decide to release these basic

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,850
tools for creating other kids other

00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:34,310
people could do it and as they're huge

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:38,770
and there are off Ormet needs we can we

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:41,360
unload in our laboratory we cannot and

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,270
Design kits for all the possible

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,980
diseases that we could do so this could

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,980
be an opportunity for open source

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,810
biotechnology another opportunity for

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,520
biotechnology that here is not only

00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,520
important for people in undeveloped

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,100
countries but also for people in

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,930
developed countries because we live in a

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,440
global H now and everybody seems to be

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:09,500
traveling all over is that the emergence

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,260
of new viruses for instance in Venezuela

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,470
in the plains we have the one editor

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:23,750
virus which is a hemorrhagic virus we'd

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:27,380
have a fairly high lethality and the

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:31,760
death rate is around thirty percent I

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:34,190
think and if this virus spreads out it

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,830
could be very dangerous the same way

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:43,910
than other viruses in Africa like Ebola

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:47,270
or rift fever so this sign of cheap

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:52,670
quick new test cool offer an opportunity

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:54,890
to do sampling of permanent sampling of

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,170
the areas which we know are endemic for

00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:01,820
virus in in order to detect the

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:08,070
outbreaks before they spread now we're

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:12,720
we have been speaking about trends in

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:16,980
in diagnostic basis on proteins we

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,130
haven't spoken about trends in DNA

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,580
because currently DNA amplifier machines

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,410
the PCR machines are very expensive for

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,990
standards of develop undeveloped

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:34,050
countries so we can see here that the

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,060
number of sequences that indan gene and

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,240
gene bank which is the database where

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:41,160
sequence DNA sequences are stored has

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,140
been growing almost exponentially at the

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:49,760
same time the cost of self sequence

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:53,910
sequencing and synthesizing DNA has been

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,120
dropping a drop in and these figures are

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,850
three years old four years old and so

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,140
the cost must be even lower now and

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:09,780
there should be even more sequences now

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:12,120
ten years ago we only need we didn't

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,990
even have the human genome well sequence

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,820
now we have like 300-400 genomes I don't

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,010
remember the exact figure but we have a

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,180
lot of genome sequences already and the

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:26,480
speed is increasing so DNA more than

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,610
proteins could be the future of

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,730
biotechnology for diagnostic health

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,780
purposes coupe and could be even cheaper

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:40,490
and what is the proposal for open source

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:43,380
by biotechnology well when I was he up

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,890
here in California last year I went to

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:51,090
the tech museum and I saw this i saw

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:53,910
that small child they're doing molecular

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,310
biology that that child could be like

00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,580
five or six years old and he was

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:02,310
creating very easily for him of course

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:06,810
there was a rack of petra dishes there

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:09,930
and there were as solutions so the kid

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:12,120
was just spreading like the solution the

00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:15,120
DNA the bacteria over the petri dish and

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,090
put it on the stove and next day he went

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,580
to internet and he checked his green

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,510
fluorescent bacteria bacteria glow in

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,230
the dark I

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:29,240
that when I was 20 years old in college

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:31,650
so people do not need to know the basic

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,200
foundations of knowledge in molecular

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:38,280
biotechnology to get useful results this

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,370
is very important and the same way that

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,040
a person coder doesn't have to know

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:47,160
quantum electrodynamics and electronic

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,440
to create good programs people could use

00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,920
these new biotechnological tools to

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,950
create to create their own solutions to

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,570
their very local problems that probably

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,740
they don't have a big market share

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:05,730
enough to justify a perfect excuse me

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:10,260
too don't have a market share enough to

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,420
that it will give them enough to create

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,470
a company or to get venture capital but

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,360
if these chips get really really tool

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,700
these tools get really really cheap they

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,250
could do it for instance in the other

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,010
picture we have like this new DNA

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:29,640
amplifier machine the total cost of this

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:33,930
machine is ten dollars current machines

00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,610
are costs around two to three hundred to

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,380
three thousand dollars they are too

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:40,440
expensive for us in the developing

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:43,050
country which is which is the proposal

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,990
here designing the primates the DNA

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:48,390
primers is not really it's not a really

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,230
cumbersome process it could be done in

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:55,230
one day designing a primer for diagnosis

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:59,310
analysis what is a primary a primary SAT

00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:03,120
DNA's a DNA sequence a very short

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:06,630
sequence around 20 nucleotides 20 weight

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:10,710
basis and it could be if you have the

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:13,710
genome on a online or on a database that

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,350
many genomes of diseases there are

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,270
online you could design with only a

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:23,640
computer and access to internet your

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:28,880
primary then you cool synthesizes and as

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,880
the cost of DNA synthesis are going down

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,980
it could be fairly cheap even for people

00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,360
in undeveloped country soap

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:40,970
if we could distribute these machines

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,410
they are cheap enough for there being

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:49,850
one in every even small village hospital

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:54,620
so the Regents could be cheap too

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:57,940
because the reunions are are not a pet

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,559
are the paint that the patent expired

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,790
for the enzymes that make it possible

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,190
and all the reagents are could be

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:10,160
manufactured locally distributed locally

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:15,890
and it could drop the drive down the

00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:18,169
prices in any case with this machine

00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,910
this machine school also be connected to

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,740
the internet and they run up and you

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,080
just don't let download the program for

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:28,190
the region sir and you have your results

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,530
in 30 minutes I suppose it has one or

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,990
two hours as now so these machines are

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:37,160
even not only cheaper but faster than

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:41,210
current Peter DNA amplifying machines so

00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:43,970
the proposal could be that you could

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,700
build around this machine a community of

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:49,790
developers in biotechnology because the

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,919
developing is not really expected it's

00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:56,780
not really expensive or difficult what

00:27:51,919 --> 00:28:00,470
what is difficult here the trials of the

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:04,580
new diagnostic method and that's why it

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:06,200
is an advantage to do to do this in on

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,419
the well in undeveloped countries

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,400
because the burden of regulation is a

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:16,640
lot less strict than here in the United

00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:20,840
States or in Europe regulation is almost

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,049
non-existent and they ask for very

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,660
little for very little proof so you can

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,150
market your test with medication is

00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,010
another issue but with the diagnostic of

00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:34,429
test it cooled alone and even in the

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:38,540
case of livestock there is no there is

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:43,830
even less regulation that for that for

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:48,240
trials for diagnostic methods for people

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:51,299
so a net word of users of these machines

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,610
will allow us to distribute clinical

00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:58,919
trials of math diagnostic methods so it

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:03,480
could spread it we would spread the

00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:06,390
burden and as there is a physical part

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:12,390
of this that has to be synthesized and

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:14,610
primary synthesis is still is still not

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:18,059
cheap enough to have a primary DNA

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:23,760
synthesizer in every village or every

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:26,389
hospital the revenue of the cause the

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,950
revenue of the of the new test could be

00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:33,539
distributed among those who are willing

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:38,850
to to make the trials so this could be a

00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:41,279
new model and mix of open source and

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:45,200
co-op model that I think that could only

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,610
be successful in developing countries I

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,870
don't think it would be successful here

00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:54,240
because of patents and because of

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:58,940
boredom regulation but once this system

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,940
is starts to yield results f and if the

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:06,090
speed of approval of new tests and speed

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,909
of approval of a spill of creation of

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,350
the test because we have a bizarre model

00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,000
here going on and we have a lot of

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,580
people working different issues I think

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,179
that once it is going on it will be used

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,860
as a as a template for older models that

00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,590
could be working here and by the time

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:26,960
begins to your results technology will

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:29,990
make this kind of stuff even cheaper and

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,649
I think that could be a very good

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:36,659
approach for open source biotechnology

00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:39,480
now I'm going to speak about that a case

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:42,450
that really moved me that is about the

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:47,870
farmers of gujarat Gujarat is a state in

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:50,650
India where there are a lot of cotton

00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,960
plantations

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,360
the company Monsanto tried to get

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,960
approval of for their bt cotton that is

00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:03,800
a transgenic genetically modified khodam

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:08,510
that is resistant to pesticides around

00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:11,270
2002 they started the trials in in the

00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:15,590
field but the Indian government refused

00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:18,350
the permit refuse to allow the the big

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:23,510
cotton to be sold to farmers on grounds

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:28,040
of environmental dangers hypothetical

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:32,180
environmental risks a couple of years

00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:35,110
later well the problem with this bt

00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,550
cotton is that those are varieties

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:41,060
release it here in the United States

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:43,450
they are adapted to these whether they

00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:47,680
are adapted to this kind of soil and

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:50,900
they are not adapted to the farmers

00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,150
conditions so it's like a sander variety

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,570
and Monsanto is not going to invest more

00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:58,880
to adapt that to adapt that variety to

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:02,720
Gujarat what happened a couple of years

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,810
later a then Monsanto realized that

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,990
there were some crops some conquer up

00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:12,950
some corn fields that would seem to be

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,540
resistant to the two day insecticide so

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,920
when they took this plant and their

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:24,020
analyze DNA they found that those were

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:26,840
hybrids of the original BTW plants they

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,480
they found they were hybrids of or the

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,850
original BTW plants with plants from

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,890
gujarat and therefore they were best

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,830
suited to the environment to that

00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:40,210
whether to that soil but also they had

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:43,750
the gene that made the plants resistant

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,280
so they were doing better than

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:50,930
indigenous varieties why because they

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:56,240
were resistant to the to the insecticide

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:58,970
and therefore which will be eliminated

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,860
more quickly but they were also doing

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,260
better than the Bt cotton than the

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,470
original bt cotton because they were

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,320
suited for the

00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:10,440
that environment Monsanto tried to sue

00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,480
the farmers but it wasn't successful

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,480
because there were so many of them that

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,020
it was just pointless and the Indian

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,659
government later tried to avoid the the

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,970
spreading of these plants but they were

00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,299
also successful because these plants do

00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:30,140
much better than either variety and

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:33,659
farmers are happy with them they have

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:39,179
they have better yields around thirty or

00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:43,049
forty percent and the the the picture

00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:48,900
down there the blue the blue package

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:53,190
it's a package of seeds of these hybrid

00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:56,460
seeds well you see that the work best

00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:59,190
has the B and the T letters highlighted

00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,350
right they are not saying that this is

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:05,299
bt cotton birthday that's a way of

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:08,310
saying and it's it says F one that is in

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:11,159
Mendelian genetics is a term for the

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:13,710
first generation of hybrids so they are

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,129
implying without telling us explicitly

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:19,169
to avoid to be to avoid being sued by

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:22,200
Monsanto prosecuted by the Indian

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:24,119
government well that was some years ago

00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,179
now they are not being prosecuted that's

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,339
a way of telling the other farmers that

00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,409
those are hybrid seeds that will perform

00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:36,389
better and this chip by the way we're

00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:39,599
way cheaper than Monsanto seeds so this

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:42,300
is a very exciting for me this is a very

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,580
exciting example of what people could do

00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,740
when they are given the tools we have

00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:53,010
been relying on scientists and engineers

00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:55,770
to cover our our needs of innovation in

00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:59,040
the last couple of one of the last

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:03,990
couple of centuries but we are are all

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:09,000
homo sapiens the man that knows I think

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:11,609
that it's an intrinsic trade in in us to

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,240
be able to create to be able to do new

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:17,640
things and finally we have tools cheap

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,390
enough that will elope allow people even

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,240
in the pool

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:23,880
replace to solve their problems no

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,660
matter if they are if those problems are

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,160
not profitable for from others those

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,349
prongs could ease up with cheap tools

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,269
and they have to and they want to solve

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:36,930
it because they have the interest in

00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:40,950
solving the problems so I think that is

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:43,890
it this example is a only a taste of the

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,660
things to come and it shows that people

00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,059
they don't need to get a formal

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,430
education to be creative and to be

00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:55,579
innovative and despite although all the

00:35:52,430 --> 00:36:01,019
problems that we have in the undeveloped

00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:03,660
countries despite all of these all these

00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:07,019
problems what I said before I think that

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:11,339
things are going to change things will

00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:13,410
change if these tools are available we

00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,140
only have to look the way Europe was

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:19,640
like 200 years ago and we only have to

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:23,069
look Europe now and we have seen that

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:27,329
what a mankind can achieve is wonderful

00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:31,500
once it was thought that not everybody

00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:35,250
can learn to write and read they thought

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,230
that the people in the elite they used

00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:40,170
to say that pissants didn't need that

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:42,210
now in Western societies we have like

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,690
literacy rate of more than ninety five

00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:49,680
percent that I would have shot too many

00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:51,829
of that people now we've been told or a

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,230
lot of people thinks anyway that

00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:57,509
innovation is only it's only feasible

00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,190
and possible for a few chosen ones I

00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:02,750
don't think that I don't be I don't

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:05,849
believe that and I think that all of

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:09,509
these tools we have now and the tools

00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:13,289
that we have in the future will change

00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:16,250
things and they will be more efficient

00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:19,380
for an environment that has a lot of

00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,630
problems there are very serious but that

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,160
can be solved but also has a lot of

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,160
opportunities thank you very much

00:37:50,890 --> 00:38:00,470
we have Howie how easy will be trading

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:03,800
inside South America we have a number of

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:07,580
free trade agreements and we're on the

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,760
way of making borders less cumbersome

00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:14,750
for commerce and for people and right

00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,670
now is is fairly easy to trade inside

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,490
South America the main problem is not

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:23,900
the trade itself but distribute

00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:28,190
distribution channels because as private

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:31,130
companies that they have a very I have a

00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,710
very restricted list of products and

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,880
they are only carrying their product and

00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,950
the public sector the government

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,320
sometimes is not interested in to this

00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:41,390
or any knee an initiative for instance

00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,850
from the Venezuelan government will be

00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:46,630
only distributed in Venezuelan we will

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:52,510
have to look for other distributors so

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:54,860
the no distribution channels are harder

00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,770
that's the main problem rather than the

00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,980
than the tariffs and taxes between

00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,980
countries

00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:24,470
one has been my our experience with a

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:29,360
government and the challenges or under

00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:32,560
help we have had from them right so far

00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:36,530
the government has helped us a lot in

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,790
some ways but also the bureaucracy has

00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:42,350
been a really really difficult issue

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,870
because there are a lot of offices and

00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,630
they approved the money but then someone

00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:50,080
then it's it stays in an office for a

00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:55,160
month and it for an ornament that's a

00:39:50,080 --> 00:40:00,020
very hard issue we have had approval

00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:03,470
from the government and actually the the

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,950
funding that we got for this project it

00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:09,980
was a very interesting method because it

00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:12,560
was a event venture capital from the

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,060
government they are expecting us to

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,990
create a company and to share the

00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:26,300
revenue when with them this they didn't

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:31,160
give to us I will just say garant less

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:34,370
money or ask or funding for free but

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:38,390
they they want a part of revenue of the

00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:43,040
of this company that we have now and we

00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:45,470
have a company and the next step is that

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,220
it will be my job my future hopefully

00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:52,160
will be with the revenue of this company

00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,410
create a new company totally independent

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,170
from the government and self-funded or

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:04,370
the self-funded or funded from the

00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:07,400
revenue from the check it concerning

00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:11,960
political views in Venezuela right now

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,780
it's very very it's a very sensitive

00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,210
issue if you're working with the

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,000
government and

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:24,130
your political position and is not the

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,349
same than the government mostly you can

00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:31,480
have a funding or you can have other

00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:36,220
help or a kinds of help but you could

00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,050
find with stubborn people that will make

00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:42,820
things difficult for you if they find

00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:46,210
that you oppose the government but so

00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:49,720
far it has been even if most of the

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:51,700
people in my laboratory up we're not

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,490
sympathetic to the government to say in

00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:58,109
a polite way we have a we're working

00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,109
together and that's what matters

00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,830
