What's In It for Me? How Your Company Can Benefit from Open Sourcing Code

As the open source community continues to clamor for more companies to open source their code, more and more executives are asking themselves just what open source can do for their company. There are a number of ways for a company to open source an internal project: from tossing code over the wall on the one hand to running a fully open development project on the other to any combination of the two.

This talk will discuss the costs and benefits associated with each method as well as how to successfully launch your new open source project.

good evening ladies and gentlemen and

00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,900
welcome to the open source developers at

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,430
Go

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,900
speaker series which is our speaker

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,670
series designed to give the general

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,260
public a better idea of what some of the

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,520
awesome open-source developers that

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,380
Google has hired are up to in their

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,970
daily lives it is my pleasure this

00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,800
evening to present ben collins-sussman

00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,210
and brian fitzpatrick two of the

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,730
engineers who work on Google's open

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,980
source team and in their evening Jobs or

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,660
subversion developers and I don't know

00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,130
just generally awesome guys so without

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,360
further ado I shall hand you over to Ben

00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,370
and Fitz who are going to be discussing

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,630
this evening what's in it for me how

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:04,640
your company can benefit from open

00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:08,660
source and code Thanks huh so he's been

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,060
and I'm Fitz and we're gonna couple

00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,970
different things this evening having to

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,370
do with companies and organizations open

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,420
sourcing typically existing code base I

00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,920
think we should point out this is sort

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,450
of a follow up to another talk that

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,730
we've been giving for years about how to

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,750
manage an open-source community if

00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,890
you've already got an open source

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,480
community but then we sort of realized

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,770
there's this other demand that there are

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,780
a lot of organizations and corporations

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,850
that are thinking of starting open

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,920
source communities or releasing code to

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,300
the world and they have a lot of

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,800
questions about how to do that so that's

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,330
that's where this talk is coming from

00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,310
right so the standard disclaimers apply

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,570
these are our opinions if you disagree

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,190
with them we recommend you get your own

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,540
talk somewhere else

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,340
our target audience against their

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,440
organizations and companies that want to

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,330
open code and it's it's basically

00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,310
different strategies for open sourcing

00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,750
code beyond the fact that you're just

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,430
throwing a pile of source code out there

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,710
we're going to talk about the pros and

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,230
cons of each again our opinions and

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,340
prescribe best practices for for doing

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,420
so so to start off why would you go open

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,850
source in the first place why are you

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,369
going to open source part or all of you

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,959
a particular code base that you have you

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,040
basically want to do it not just because

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,510
you're a nice person although you may

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,190
very well be a nice person but because

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,349
there's some sort of gain for you your

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,150
company to get from doing this um

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:22,760
whether that's creating better software

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,769
or creating a real relationship with

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,540
your users especially if your users in

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,040
some case are developers which is often

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,769
the way that open-source projects begin

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,450
and what are your goals are there's

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,700
public relations or you're looking for

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,280
goodwill free labor is a big deal too

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,749
because a lot of times it can it can

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,189
absolutely be the difference between

00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:41,930
releasing your product in five years

00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:42,790
versus releasing your product in a year

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,560
if you've got

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,909
20 volunteers working on it it just

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,459
depends on how you're able to manage

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,870
that and then of course if money is not

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,629
necessarily an issue to you sometimes

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,689
people will release code just to disrupt

00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,819
a whole area of market on purpose and

00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:59,650
that's that's a great thing too if you

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,209
have the resources for it right it's

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,609
hard to compete in some cases with a

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,640
closed source product if an open source

00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:08,590
one is available and sort of commoditize

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,980
is that particular area especially if

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,400
it's if it's really good so when we talk

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,299
about open source software one of the

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,879
things at least will not have talked

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,500
with fits our buddy Karl when we talk

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,579
about how good a piece of open source

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,260
software is we actually don't

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,450
necessarily talk about the software

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,819
itself the first thing we talk about is

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,470
how healthy is the community because it

00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,790
doesn't matter if you have the best

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,560
software ever written if it's just

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,269
sitting on a server and nobody's looking

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,329
at it nobody's developing it or

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,189
supporting it it may as well not exist

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,810
and so that's always the first thing we

00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:42,819
look at is you know how active is the

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,040
community how active is the user

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,169
community and the developer community

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,599
and that is ultimately the metric we use

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,699
for evaluating success when we talk

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,829
about releasing open-source software and

00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,299
you'll see that in the slides coming up

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:59,889
that's how we measure that's our main

00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:01,780
metric it's not users we don't want a

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:03,159
billion users if they use the product

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,989
once to go away and we want people that

00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,030
are going to be heavy users and that's a

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,099
theme and you hear a lot here at Google

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,500
you want people who use the product so

00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:13,659
usage is important howdy how is that

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,829
community healthy active developers you

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,289
can't just have people that say they're

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,209
developers you know show up and sort of

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,799
constantly moving forward in one way or

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,430
another and if you don't have a

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,169
community

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,639
you basically might as well not have a

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,460
piece of software because it's

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
eventually going to bit rot until

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,430
eventually some sort of community comes

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,599
and picks it up and make something

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,970
happen with it because remember if you

00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,830
the way that operating systems and and

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,539
just the state of the art changes

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,639
there's gonna be incompatibilities that

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,500
are introduced and changes that make

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,060
your software no longer work over the

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,280
course of time unless you have someone

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,979
maintaining it right right and modifying

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,720
and changing it that sort of thing so

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,090
why don't we talk about the first do I

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,039
mean I'll do this one the zero the zero

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,380
of course we're counting by starting at

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,610
0 this is the first approach to

00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,590
Oakland searching software and that is

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,060
you put out a press release that you've

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,880
just open sourced your code but your

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,680
license does not actually open source

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,330
this is not really a strategy but we

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,100
listed here because companies have done

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,080
this before and it's great because you

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,420
get a little bit of PR and you don't

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,950
have to do a darn thing but it's awful

00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,870
because people will call you out and

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,540
you'll look like a fool and people may

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,240
burn your house down so there is a lot

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,160
of point in doing its unless unless your

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,480
goal is to destroy trust with your users

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,990
that's about the really the only

00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,060
long-term effect this have basically

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,400
been trying to get some open-source mojo

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,710
without actually doing the work involved

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,030
and in some of its cluelessness but some

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,090
of it is actually I think somewhat

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,830
malicious but it's it's not a long-term

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,110
sustainable nor is it really going to do

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,450
you any good so that brings us to the

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,890
the initial approach I think that a lot

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,650
of companies did which is a throat code

00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,360
over the wall you clean up the code you

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,040
remove names from it you get approved by

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,380
legal you put the licenses in the files

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,350
you push it over the wall and then you

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,940
go back to your poker game that's really

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,560
great you get you can get a PR splash

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,970
maybe but the public relations foo

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,040
you're going to get from that isn't from

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,650
developers or open-source programmers

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,210
that's gonna be you're gonna get that

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,440
from people that have no idea what open

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,510
source our development is from it's

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,520
gonna be sort of off out in the other

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,770
world that possibly management possibly

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,480
users that sort of thing it's pretty

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,640
effortless it's not that hard to do this

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,230
the cons are that you don't have any

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,030
community to keep your software alive

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,680
and if one does form it's going to form

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,750
somewhere and way far away from you most

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,970
likely so your software starts to get

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,230
rot real techies realize that you're not

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,940
doing anything really relatively

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,230
interesting and they don't give you any

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,030
credibility no you know a lot of

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,740
companies do this when they simply want

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,660
to stop maintaining software

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,820
I mean it's actually just sort of a

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,380
cast-off technique like well the

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,090
software is good it would be terrible to

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,200
delete a bit rot inside the company so

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,820
we'll let it bit rot outside the company

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,990
well you know sometimes sometimes if

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,970
they're lucky a community will pick it

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,710
up and walk away and run with it and

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,710
that's great but certainly as a

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,580
corporation you're left out you know

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,530
maybe that's what you intended but

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,300
usually not right unless there's some

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,120
revolutionary interesting

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,530
thing going on in the code that's

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,449
someone else can pick up and use or

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,330
codex or something like that but that's

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,180
not often the case so the next level of

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,580
I guess where we're numbering these

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,460
strategies in terms of goodness I

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,319
suppose and that is you have a public

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,669
code repository so people can actually

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,069
see what you're doing instead of a one

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:31,810
time push over the wall you're actually

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,819
pushing over the wall on a daily basis

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,530
all three developments still happening

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:38,560
in-house all your design decisions all

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,300
of your discussions but you know when

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,330
you actually make code changes people

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,300
can see it and this is nice I mean you

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,650
definitely get good better better PR and

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,389
you may actually get some volunteers

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,650
contributing because they can track the

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,139
code as it changes from day to day and

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,729
say AHA I see a bug or here's here's a

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,389
little enhancement let me mail it to you

00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:00,069
guys so you get a little bit more cred

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,840
the problem with this of course is that

00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,729
you're not really giving full

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,710
participatory rights to these volunteers

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,090
and this is this is a theme that comes

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,639
up over and over we talk about having

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,250
the bus keys meaning you're driving a

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,539
bus and we think about projects as

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,750
everybody sitting at a bus going in a

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:19,000
certain direction and if you don't let

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,099
everybody take turns driving the bus and

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,900
really having a kind of sense of stake

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:24,610
or ownership in the project you're not

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,449
going to get great participation you're

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,569
not gonna get really high quality

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,639
developers yeah you get no leaders and

00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,829
and really what you sort of get drive-by

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,690
patches you know people will maybe walk

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,700
by give you a little patch walk away

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,050
there's no incentive for them to stay in

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,370
because they don't have any sense of

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,990
ownership and they're the followers and

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,360
they they tend and they tend not to be

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,649
so helpful I mean certainly not as

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,320
strong as developers who you might hire

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:56,589
and the same the same issues are as with

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,449
the the previous strategies in that if

00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,620
they're the software is alive in the

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:01,060
sense that you're paying people in your

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,350
company to keep it alive but you don't

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,149
really have an open-source community

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,040
around it if your company dies and goes

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,899
under that software is not gonna live on

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,880
you don't really have an external

00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,769
community that you're participating and

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,060
maybe a bunch of followers will pop up

00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,070
somewhere sort of like a fan club but

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,949
it's not it's not particularly useful to

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,590
the project itself and there's a general

00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:22,750
sense of distrust I mean I mean it's not

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,340
consensus-based organization it's a

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,030
corporation doing what it wants and

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,770
throwing little scraps to the public

00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,880
trust I mean your decision-making in

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,750
your ideas about where you're gonna go

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,160
and what you're gonna do and your

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,170
general developments taking place in

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,000
house the only point people externally

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,770
can determine what where you're going is

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,260
by looking at your code possibly your

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,850
log messages and they have no idea where

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,140
you're going next so there's a little

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,360
bit of tends to be a bit of uneasiness

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,040
as well as general distrust what is your

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,450
agenda what is your company getting

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,950
about by doing this open source

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,630
development are you gonna pull the rug

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,970
out and change things up really quickly

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,470
one day is it gonna leave people users

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,400
or developers and alerts that sort of

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,070
thing so so there's always that so so

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,400
moving along but you have the open

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,720
monarchy so this open monarchy

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,150
development is where you have a public

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,610
discussion in public repository your

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,560
committees are mostly employees but

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,420
every once in a while you'll give a

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,860
volunteer the key is someone outside of

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,870
your company will get if they're really

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,480
extraordinary

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,710
and one one entity and typically in this

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,300
case we're talking about one lead

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,070
developer there's your project leading

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,080
the company that rules the project and

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,750
makes all the decisions so it's very

00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,670
top-down organization the decrees come

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,160
from you know on high from this one

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,320
person and everyone else is sort of

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,550
implementers and doers this is

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,770
essentially the same as the previous

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,600
slide except that the discussions are

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,310
taking place in public the company is

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,930
still running the show it's making all

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,850
the decisions it's just at least it's

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,440
talking out in public about what it's

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,510
doing right and you can see them making

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,490
their decisions so the pros again is and

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,740
you can get public relations benefits

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,090
from opening this bit you will get more

00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,230
credibility from techies because they

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,720
can see that you're actually starting to

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,580
do your development in public and you

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,840
you will attract better quality

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,760
volunteers because they can participate

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,140
more they can see more of what's going

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,480
on they have more insight into what

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,640
you're doing it's not a matter of hey do

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,260
this or that sort of thing they have a

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,630
better idea of where your roadmap is

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,430
they can pick up new features they can

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,290
pick up bugs they can participate

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,670
directly in the discussions now they may

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,100
or may not really be able to effect

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,240
those discussions in the sense that you

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,530
know the corporate agenda will always

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,150
win but it but at least they can

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,990
participate right right and that gives

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,670
them a little more sense of ownership

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,860
and this was we want to put better

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,950
software as a result with with somewhat

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,130
less effort from your part

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,480
internally engineering-wise the problem

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,640
is that that this isn't a long-term

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,130
sustainable thing what happens when your

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,870
company can discontinue the product what

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,830
happens when the person who is the lead

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,990
disappears

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,550
what happens to that leadership there's

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,990
a power void there and there isn't

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,580
anyone used to sort of filling that

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,660
spliff the corporation just takes the

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,500
software in a direction that really

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,720
angers everyone

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,460
angers all the users or angles the other

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,530
developers who are volunteering their

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,470
time and they're powerless to affect

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,970
this new direction then they that's

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,620
where we talk about angry revolutions

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,110
that may force the project and can walk

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,360
away because they've essentially they've

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,570
got no vote and you still find the sense

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,790
of general distrust there as well yeah

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,470
which leads us on to consensus based

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,270
development this is the one that

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,950
obviously we've been working towards

00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,590
this is what we try to preach and

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,300
persuade companies to go with and it

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,830
might be obvious to a lot of people who

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,480
already work at open source software but

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,740
it's actually sort of shocking to a lot

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,200
of corporations that haven't thought

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,030
about open source and the theory is that

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,190
everything is public all of your

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,110
discussion all of your code all of your

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,640
decision making almost any well almost

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,140
everything well except maybe you'll have

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,380
an internal mailing list to talk about

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,560
you know private agenda such but the

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,240
point is all decisions are made based on

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,710
the consensus of the community in other

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,840
words the project is its own

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,610
organization it exists independently of

00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,180
any corporation that is paying people to

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,010
work on it and the people who are

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,570
members of the project they're the ones

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,070
who make the decisions they may all be

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,690
wearing two hats right they may all be

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,370
wearing a hat of the corporation that

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,230
pays them to work on the software but

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,970
they're also wearing the hat of what is

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,200
good for this project in the long term

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,910
because you know I may not always be

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,700
working for the same company and I want

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,210
this software to live independent of my

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,970
employer and this is the shocking bit to

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,860
a lot of folks is that in order to join

00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,780
the community you actually have to earn

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,850
your access and we have interesting

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,170
stories where for example Fitz and I

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,550
used to work at CollabNet which was a

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,200
company that sponsored the subversion

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,850
project and they actually did a good job

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,970
of building a consensus database

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,530
development and we hired somebody and

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,180
friend of ours named Mike pilato to work

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,500
on subversion full time full time

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,850
employee and he showed up the first day

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,160
and he said all right where do I start

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,970
committing the code and we said well

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,560
you're gonna have to earn

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,180
access well what do you mean well you're

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,939
gonna have to submit patches and prove

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,560
to everyone else in the project that

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,759
people that we boys have closed exactly

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,019
it's a bunch of people who didn't worry

00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,540
that you have to prove to them that that

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,040
that you are gonna play by the rules and

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,350
that you're a good team member and you

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,389
know it's essentially like a second job

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,040
application right even though kleban

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,319
it's paying you to write this code it's

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,480
a it's a separate barrier but what you

00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:13,100
wind up with is is is this isn't a

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,899
slight to the people who are working on

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,449
your project who are an employees of the

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,399
corporation these people can see oh you

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,019
know we've got they've hired someone but

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,060
that person still has to prove that they

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,500
understand how our community works that

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,029
they have a general clue and they

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,079
they're going through the same process

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,089
that these other people have gone

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,939
through but we have seen corporations

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,680
that write that sort of are driving open

00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:37,160
source projects and they do commit this

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,689
I call it a big mistake though hire

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,160
somebody work on the software and let us

00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:42,860
give them commit access instantly and

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,389
that breaks the social norms it breaks

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,490
the fabric that holds the community

00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,959
together because suddenly it's not about

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,910
whether people want you in the community

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,079
it's just about whether some corporation

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,059
has happened to give you technical

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,920
access or not now sort of sort of a

00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,769
digression on this is is a story about

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,629
our friend Carl a few years ago so the

00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,220
subversion community we have a document

00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:04,279
on our style guide we have a basically

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,689
readability access that you have you

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,129
have to write our code in a certain way

00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,689
you document in a certain way about your

00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:10,209
log message a certain way and it's

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,079
actually an unbelievably

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,459
obsessive/compulsive list of things that

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,889
people are required to but it's very

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,509
clear it's very it's very clear exactly

00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,860
there's very little question about what

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:20,360
you should or shouldn't do as far as

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,360
formatting the code and that's and

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,819
documenting things are however this is a

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,379
way of inviting new people in our

00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:29,870
community people understand once they

00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:31,639
come in how things are done and we get

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,009
volunteers from around the world dozens

00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,170
and dozens of them to follow this they

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,579
submit patches and for free they're not

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,259
getting paid and we say oh you know this

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,509
doesn't conform to this read that make

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:43,610
these changes they resubmit all doesn't

00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:46,100
do that quite yet read and resubmit five

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,870
six times before a patch is accepted and

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,339
these people are doing this because they

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,319
want to be part of this community they

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,750
want to work on this project our friend

00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,059
Carl went to a company he was doing some

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,459
consulting with and you know he was

00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,529
talking about using our version control

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,509
system and giving

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,310
assistant log messages in that sort of

00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,930
thing and they're like oh you know we

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,730
can never get our developers to write

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,060
consistent log messages we just can't

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,499
get to do it and Hart was sort of at a

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,350
loss of what to say think what you know

00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:15,519
aren't you paying their salaries and

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,559
it's like yeah but just can't get him to

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,660
do this and because like I have 30

00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,029
people throw across the world don't pay

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,100
a thing to and they do everything that

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,540
we tell them to do it's because these

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,089
people want to be part of this community

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,529
you're you earn being a member of this

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,079
community there is a barrier to entry

00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:34,660
it's not a hazing process or some sort

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,189
of abuse but it's it's it just it means

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,689
something right it means it the

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,980
membership actually has a meaning

00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:40,600
because you had to work for it a little

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,089
bit and prove that you were willing to

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,290
play by the rules just just as a sign of

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,759
goodwill towards the rest of the

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:50,949
community right it's not it's not so

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:54,790
much about hazing so this is a great way

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:56,079
to work you get PR slowly at first and

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,220
over time it gets greater and greater

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,749
and greater it's gotten to the point now

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,819
where I think CollabNet that that's

00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:03,370
their entire business plan is basically

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,899
supporting subversion then and it may

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,189
disagree with they may disagree with

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,929
that but but I mean that is that is

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,429
their central marketing and the PR now

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,780
is like hey we are the founders of a

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,220
subversion project come to us we're the

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,709
experts and that was something it took

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,209
many years to achieve but it is a

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,130
long-term strategy and it's really

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,890
paying off for them now techies will

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,169
give you absolute cred you get the best

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,120
volunteers you get the the leaders kind

00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,740
of folks that you would love to hire in

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,880
your company and in fact that is what

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,860
happens in fact a lot of the times

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,240
people who come into these projects they

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,070
get full ownership of the project they

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,809
really drive the bus and a corporation

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,429
will say hey we want to hire you to work

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,350
on this full-time instead of on weekends

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,360
it's a great great opportunity for them

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,250
everyone trusts each other there's a lot

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,600
of respect the software is as good as

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,250
it's gonna get I mean you have the

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,179
absolutely best people looking at it and

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,620
everyone's doing it because they're

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:51,390
passionate about it not because they're

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,500
being paid to do it necessarily right

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,299
that is that you're not gonna get a big

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,980
boost about this from this right away

00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:59,200
you're not gonna get that sudden like

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,399
you know PR woohoo waving the flag we

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,220
were at least a bunch of code kind of a

00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:05,649
thing but and also in the short term you

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,140
really have to put the focus of the

00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:09,760
project first you can't sort of start

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,530
tweaking it and adding things to it and

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
making changes that are gonna suddenly

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,910
give your company some sort of benefit

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,380
if you're writing a piece of software to

00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,750
accomplish a particular task or address

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,250
a particular shortcoming or need you

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,320
have to concentrate on doing that

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,210
results in better software but it might

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,980
not get you what you want as a company

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,270
it drives project managers crazy right

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,280
because a customer will say we need

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,810
feature X yeah well why can't we tell

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,670
our developers to write feature X and

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,650
the software and the answer is well you

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,600
can but they're gonna have to get the

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,580
entire community to agree on this and

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,070
usually it's not a problem sometimes it

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,600
is and you have to walk that line and be

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,550
careful that your own corporate agenda

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,140
is not coming before what the community

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,070
wants are nice and as our president say

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,690
it's hard work it's how you but you need

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,160
to hire strong leaders you can't just

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,290
take a bunch of engineers and throw them

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,390
at this project or this problem you need

00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,270
to hire people who are designers

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,500
architects coders engineers understand

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,910
algorithm and they have to play well

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,320
with others and they hand and say

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,890
there's a weak market there and play

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,830
well with others

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,390
right so you're looking for people who

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,100
are working in a used to working in a

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,120
team environment and can work with other

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,320
people so why do we think this is best

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,580
one of the things that we've sort of

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,070
come to see over the past few years

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,440
working working in both internally at

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,780
Google and other places is that the in

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,790
the past companies have isolated their

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,320
developers from their users they their

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,330
developers can be more productive if you

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,860
lock them in a room by themselves give

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,570
them peace and quiet and some music or

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,090
whatever not and let them write code

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,740
well my argument against that is if

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,210
they're writing the wrong code it

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,820
doesn't matter how much code they're

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,710
writing so it whether whether your

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,110
consumers are our internal or external

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,850
the closer you can bring your consumer

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,220
the consumers of your code to the people

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,470
writing the code and get get a positive

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,440
feedback loop as opposed to the sort of

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,210
Slashdot you suck feedback loop you can

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,310
be a more productive engineers and

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,700
better software I think there's another

00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,170
reason I believe to think that this is

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,580
the best of that is it is the most

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:11,350
long-term sustainable in the sense that

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,820
companies will come and go individual

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,310
participants in the project will come

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,840
and go but if the project is run well on

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,440
the community is really based on this

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,730
consensus driven system it will last a

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,350
really really long time and we've

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,460
watched this happen for a good product I

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,870
mean like like the Apache Software

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,730
Foundation right with

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,140
apache and web server project itself

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,760
it's been going out for years even

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,380
though 12 years people have come and

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,760
gone and companies have come and gone

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,350
and I guess in a perfect situation you

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,430
know there's a lot of similarities to

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,350
what people talking about government

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,820
models right a lot of people will say

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,370
the ideal government is an enlightened

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,750
despot the problem is you can't always

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,700
get one and if you can it's not

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,410
sustainable right so people settle for

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,300
democracy and this is sort of a similar

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,470
kind of argument ideally there are

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,630
projects out there where there really

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,120
isn't enlightened despot like Linus or

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,250
maybe that's not a good example but we

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,470
don't Guido exactly that's a good lesson

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,880
for the Python project enlightened

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,370
despot does a great job

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,290
not necessarily sustainable in the long

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,140
term maybe someone will succeed him or

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,830
maybe maybe somebody won't but yeah

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,480
exactly

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,100
but if you've really got a sort of a

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,990
consensus based system you're guaranteed

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,450
people will always step up and the

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,890
project will keep going so and if you do

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,360
this right that your internal developers

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,250
will see the benefits one of the things

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,320
about this is that internal developers

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,270
who aren't used to working in the open

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,350
source world they can have it we'll talk

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,700
a little more about this in a minute but

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,620
they can have a hard time understanding

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,990
why is this good I you know people

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,570
watching me work and it seems like a

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,890
waste of time but if if it's done right

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,090
you know we'll see the benefits of

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,580
actually doing this from a software

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,320
point of view this is where people a lot

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,940
of corporations get freaked out they're

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,760
saying wait you're asking me to

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,230
essentially take my product and throw it

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,429
to a bunch of random strangers and let

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,590
them decide what to do with it and

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,480
that's that's one way of looking at it

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,970
it's not very it's not a useful way of

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,320
looking at it the answer is no one's

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,210
gonna hijack your product no one's gonna

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,130
force you to do anything the way you

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,350
make sure that happens is you start the

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,600
project out with a really good small

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,520
core group of people who trust each

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,800
other who respect each other who are

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,800
humble who work well with others and who

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,050
are going to attract like-minded people

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,540
it's really that small core establishes

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,400
the culture of the product and the whole

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,530
project rather and and it becomes a

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,550
self-selecting group way but to address

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,620
the control thing when you talk about

00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,210
community centric consensus based

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,730
software development people immediately

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,020
think that a bunch of weirdos on the

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,120
internet or start writing my software

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,270
and making decisions you know the world

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,470
is full of jerks except the internet

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,260
makes it seem like they all live right

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,900
next door

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,130
okay so the thing is is that what you

00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,900
have to do there's a lot of things you

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,850
can do this to do this first of all is

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,800
you have to set the stage for your

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,870
software development you need to choose

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,340
a well scope mission of what your

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,810
software products going to do this is

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,700
again a lot of this just comes down to

00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,620
communication things that probably seem

00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,910
obvious to you and me but in general

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,680
people sort of look past them because

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,260
they're focused on the engineering

00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,150
aspect so choose a well scope mission to

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,070
establish a culture of your project

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,530
preferably a respectful one not every

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,030
culture is respectful necessarily set

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,310
the tone of your discussion carefully

00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,290
don't be afraid to tell people you know

00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,910
we're not we don't treat each other like

00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,430
that someone starts flaming and swearing

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,490
and screaming and cursing and like me

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,990
and then Ben tells me to stop it

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:27,800
but you know have a decision-making

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,180
process process and a talk that we gave

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,950
here last year that's up on a google

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,300
video as well is uh what is our

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,980
poisonous people talk it's how to

00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,130
protect your open-source project from

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,810
poisonous people and that sort of gives

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,390
you a lot of tips and clues on how to

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,520
handle this sort of the chaos that's

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,900
surrounding you and the rest of the

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,910
world we're actually gonna go into

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,380
detail about how to sort of set up one

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,170
of these communities now I think that's

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:54,020
that's where we're headed so we do this

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,180
a lot of words like everything's a lot

00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,800
of work I mean I I noticed you know at

00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,060
least with the subversion project it

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,760
started out with just a handful of us

00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,710
after three or four years I found that I

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,600
was spending half my time coding and

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,640
after my time managing the community and

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,400
and I don't think that was a waste of

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,530
time because it was necessary to keep it

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,230
going

00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,820
yep so a lot of people people are afraid

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,500
of forking they you've put your code out

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,740
there and with a free lor open license

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,120
and people can actually take a copy of

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,580
it go somewhere else start working on it

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,770
rename it and just start doing things

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,930
with it companies are freaked out about

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,340
this however when you're doing consensus

00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,770
based development this is actually

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,390
extremely rare because if the majority

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,070
of the people are happy with the

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,110
direction your software is going in and

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,280
a minority leaves well you know so what

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,990
you've lost a minority of your

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,240
developers certainly you don't want to

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,890
alienate people in your in your project

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,270
but if 70 percent of the people are

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,410
happy with what's going on in 30 percent

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,970
all right and they want to go out there

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,050
maybe it's best that they go elsewhere

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,480
and doose do what they want to do

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,010
why what they want to do GCC did this

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,840
many years ago with the eggs project

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,000
remember and what happened near any

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,620
years later they emerged again usually

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,750
forking as a sign of a dysfunctional

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,610
community at least many of the Forks

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,110
that I've seen and it's you can't

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,240
necessarily point to blame out any one

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,030
person but if your community is running

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,140
very well and healthy and things are

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,540
getting done and people are happy

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,800
there's very low chance of working so if

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,930
you're putting if you're putting energy

00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,870
meeting developers and people working on

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,510
your project and and in general its

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,340
operating in consensus you're gonna have

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,170
to worry about forking so how do you

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,720
build a consensus based open-source

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,040
software project essentially these first

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,510
two slides are similar but they're

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,510
important you need to come up with a

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,460
goal which attracts people has to be

00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,140
something that you can give an elevator

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,360
pitch and say wow that sounds exciting I

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,800
really want to get involved somebody who

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,570
might just volunteer their time on

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
weeknights or somebody might want to

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,630
join your company to work on this sort

00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,660
of a project it has to be widely

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,760
appealing it might benefit your company

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,750
but it more a little more than likely

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,280
it's something it will benefit your

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,110
company in the long term not in the

00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,430
short term there won't be oh we're gonna

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,560
get this little thing written for this

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,910
customer next week it's going to be hey

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,520
we're gonna change the industry in a way

00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,680
that helps our company or we're going to

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,120
help our product in the long run clients

00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,160
a good example of that they they were

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,840
shipping a product that used CVS and

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,330
they said well you know our customers

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,550
hate CVS let's write a replacement for

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,050
CVS it's going to take years let's start

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,600
an open-source project around that and

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,950
it many years later it did pay payback

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,140
but there was a lot of upfront

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,970
investment that they had to write and

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,370
Google has recently done this with

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,910
releasing the Google web toolkit which

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:34,530
is being done in a completely open

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,410
environment and in a consensus-based

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,280
model as well so the the next thing to

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,110
do is to write a mission statement

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,850
people kind of get all freaked out and

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,250
think oh my god MBAs are in the room I'm

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:47,370
not an MBA and you know business off

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,410
mission statement touchy-feely exactly

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,620
and we're not married that it's not to

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,000
each other but so you need some sort of

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,400
a mission statement again communication

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,010
communicate is short succeed sentence to

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,390
end to any prospective developer who

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,000
might want to join your project what

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,410
you're about and also non goals are

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,410
important you might want to list at the

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,330
bottom of this sort of

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,370
you've got what what's what what are you

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,810
not about what don't you want to do this

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,100
way when someone takes a look at your

00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,380
project which is a version control

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,170
system and is thinking I really want to

00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,030
hack this 3d OpenGL visualization tool

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,550
into the core libraries of subversion

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,320
you could say you know we're not about

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,180
that we said specifically we're only

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,980
about software version and if it's

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,170
documented on a webpage it carries a

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,970
huge amount of weight as opposed to just

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,860
replying to somebody on an email list

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,330
and saying no that's not really what our

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,030
communities is about really weird how

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,380
that works people if someone says I want

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,580
to do this with your project and you say

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,200
well no we really don't want to do that

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,850
they're gonna argue with you until the

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,770
cows come home but if you say actually

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,720
we don't do that if you look at our

00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,160
mission over here it's on the page they

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,080
may argue a little bit but they're gonna

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,670
peter out and disappear this is how you

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,230
keep your community focused right you

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,170
don't want folks coming along and

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,990
diverting diverting attention and trying

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,940
to to take you off your work by changing

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,010
the route completely let when you

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,260
establish this community have a mission

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,760
before you go in with what usually does

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,950
not work and I've seen a lot of this say

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,900
on sites like source where somebody will

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,070
have an idea for something they'll start

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,250
a source which project they'll invite

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,410
people there'll be no code no mission no

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,730
goals nothing written out and the

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,260
mailing list just turns to a bunch of

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,450
people yelling at each other about what

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,070
they think the thing should be works out

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,100
a lot better if you have a small group

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,150
of people who write a good mission maybe

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,830
they have a little bit of code to

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,300
demonstrate it then they go to the

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,460
public and they say here's what we're

00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,110
about if you want to join us great if

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,000
you're not interested that's fine but at

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,530
least it's clear as to whether this is a

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,300
community that you want to take part in

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,610
or not and you don't have to get spend

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,830
hours and days arguing about people

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,450
aren't typically typically malicious

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,160
about there are plenty of people out

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,710
there but people are there they're just

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,480
they want to participate they want to

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,950
get part of the great stuff you've got

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,970
going and they want to do what they're

00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,910
interested in and what they're

00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,680
passionate about and directing that or

00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,740
deflecting that depending on what the

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,990
case might be is a really important sort

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,230
of skill to learn I would say for any

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,210
progress preserve time must prover focus

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,920
right that's the time another consensus

00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,600
I mean the energy open-source projects

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,820
aren't about cash they're about time and

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,920
focus and energy that's what that's what

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,529
the sort of currency of the open source

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,000
world

00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,649
if you like someone you pay them by

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,419
giving them your focus and time and this

00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:26,450
is how you protect your focus right

00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:28,340
so repair your team this book which is

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,429
written by our friend karl fogel right

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,590
here isn't actually a great book to read

00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:37,580
it's also free on the net at producing

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:39,649
OSS calm it basically just discusses

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,480
sort of the social bits and the nuts and

00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:43,850
bolts around building an open-source

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,159
project or free software project which

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,049
ever you have thickening everyone's skin

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,789
this this this is a bullet I think

00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:51,379
that's pretty important especially if

00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,490
you're working with it with a bunch of

00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:54,679
corporate folks who have never done

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,960
open-source software before and that is

00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,850
in the open source world it is normal

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,950
for people to review each other's code

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,110
to say hey you made a mistake here I

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,669
think this design is wrong and it is not

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,049
a personal thing it's just people saying

00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,279
well let's make the product better so

00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,610
I'm going to give you feedback on what

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,379
you just did or what you're about to do

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,840
in the corporate world of software

00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:16,220
development this is not normal in fact a

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,690
lot of folks will say well this isn't

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,570
based companies in many in many

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,649
companies yes I it's hard to say whether

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,240
it's the normal we haven't worked in

00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,559
thousands of companies but I've seen it

00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,509
and some companies I worked in where

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,129
people own certain areas of code and

00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:30,169
they make whatever changes they want and

00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:32,090
if you dare to comment on what they're

00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:34,759
doing it's taken as a personal offence

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,440
you've attacked them and you need to

00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,139
teach folks that no this is you know you

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,970
are not your code it is normal to get

00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:43,129
criticized or at least have your code

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,820
criticized and that's that's part of the

00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,379
iterative development

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,210
I think it comes to being companies

00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:48,350
whose primary focus isn't software

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,450
engineering they're using engineering as

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,830
a tool to accomplish something my friend

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,690
Matt went took started working in a

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,919
small company and engineering he was

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,750
really excited to work with this project

00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,490
that was very it was very exciting thing

00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,870
and he came in there and he did a code

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,000
review and someone submitted something

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,990
and he did another code review and

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,179
another code of view and then the

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:07,549
manager called them in and Psyche dude

00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:11,779
you're really bumming people out by all

00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:13,519
the incredibly I mean yeah people are

00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:15,649
just really getting upset you're hurting

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,759
feelings and you know you're like you

00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:20,779
shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff

00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:23,690
he's like what excuse me you know so

00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:25,639
it's open-source world is very different

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,470
for people who are used to being in sort

00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,830
of the quiet calm collected non

00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,090
open-source world internal prepare your

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,380
developers for them

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,930
so once you've done that it's time to

00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,370
move your development to the public

00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:39,830
launch public mailing lists a public

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,920
source code repository bug tracker again

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:44,840
communication tools minimize the

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,160
internal use of internal mailing lists I

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,990
often recommend to people that they

00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,340
delete the mailing list entirely but

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,880
typically if someone's developing

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,750
something that might be a tool or

00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,280
something else that other products

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,930
internally leverage they're going to

00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,590
have internal users that need to talk

00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,960
about it

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,280
it is really tempting to slip back into

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,360
the internal list though especially when

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,680
a project was getting started

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,110
what happened to us all right well I

00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,180
started developing subversion there were

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,620
just maybe four or five people and most

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,700
of us were working for one company and

00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,740
we said well why are we having all our

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,930
discussions on this mailing list

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:20,120
nobody's listening it's kind of and and

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,890
so we rather than wanting to participate

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,300
in the arguments the discussion we would

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,190
just go back to the internal list and

00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,980
sort of make a decision then and we got

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,810
called out on this the CTO said you guys

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,270
are absolutely sabotaging the project do

00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:34,820
not do this you know stop using the

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,260
internal list period and we fought and

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,430
kicked and screamed when we went back to

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,560
the public list and actually turned out

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,970
not to be so bad after all just quite a

00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,460
little more work on our part we were

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,530
being lazy and seven years later we're

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,940
like oh man Wow well actually we were

00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,410
kind of idiots a few months later some

00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,390
of the best developers we ever had just

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,950
showed up because they could see there

00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,450
was an effort I think going into the

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,030
discussion yeah it was really turning

00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,620
into something special so so once you

00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,720
got this develop a policy for working

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,550
with internal consumers of your project

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,990
so you don't have to if someone has a

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,250
question that can be asked and the

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,290
public lists it should be asked there

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,970
and do some public relations get some

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,710
volunteers don't be afraid of that one

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,700
of the things that I've seen I was to be

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,830
the vice president of public relations

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,690
at the Apache Software Foundation and

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,820
it's got to be the most thankless job

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,470
I've ever had in my life because most

00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,870
engineers think public relations is a

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,920
waste of time they really do they think

00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,540
they think public relations they

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,490
suddenly think all sizzle no steak and

00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,930
it can be sizzle with steak you know

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,090
some people never want to learn that

00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,740
however do some public relations get

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,900
some people interested get the word out

00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,460
there about your project and when it

00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,320
comes to stag mailing lists and whatnot

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,270
it's tempting to set up one firt bug

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,740
tracking one for commits one for users

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,000
one for this one for that you're just

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,680
never going to get any sort of energy or

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,300
critical mass when a project starts

00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,190
usually the developers and the users are

00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,960
the same people right there's there's

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,270
little difference between those groups

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,550
as a project gets bigger and bigger and

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,770
bigger and more popular eventually what

00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,260
you'll notice is there are so many users

00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,970
who are asking for help or asking how to

00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:05,090
use the product they can start to help

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,410
each other in fact and it becomes a lot

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,850
of noise to the point where it's hard

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,649
for developers to actually talk about

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,360
the development of a software it's lost

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:13,040
in the user noise and there's nothing

00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,510
wrong with users but at that point

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,950
that's sort of the point where you want

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,990
to split your developer and users list

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,550
and say alright if you're working on the

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,260
software itself come here if you want to

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,850
talk about how to use the software help

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,620
each other come over here and that's

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,909
fine we did that with subversion we just

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,320
finally split off our users for my

00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,580
developers mailing list Ben was do you

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,649
know still answering a lot of users

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,360
questions and one day we told them we

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:35,300
forbad him from answering email for 24

00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,679
hours and what happened is some of our

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,260
users started answering other users

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,570
questions and we realize well who needs

00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,720
us it was great a bit moved to Hawaii

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,550
and sat on a beach for you no kidding

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,260
so the summary of this obviously is is

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,520
you you want to choose a strategy based

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,200
on your goals if your goals are just a

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,750
big PR splash and throw your coat over

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,040
the wall again o declaring something not

00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,480
open-source when it's not open-source

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,730
could have your house burned down that

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,590
idea there's always trade-offs there's

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,870
no black and white involved into this

00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,460
there's a lot of gray area in in what

00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,750
you do and what combination of these

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,430
four different things but the more

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,830
energy you put into building a long-term

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,330
community the more long-term benefit

00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,190
you'll get I think that's that's the

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,700
ultimate trade-off and the less energy

00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,260
you put in upfront the more the project

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,390
is likely to just fizzle on its own just

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,740
fizzle out so it's a risk that you have

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,690
to calculate on how much energy do we

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,720
have how long do we want this together

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:30,670
how much time and energy do we have yep

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,230
I think that's yep that's it lose it so

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,090
move on to Q&A if anyone has any

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:38,720
questions or more helpfully any answers

00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:41,690
that'd be great yes is it can use the

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,970
microphone please oh wow there you have

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,340
microphones cool

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,500
so you guys were talking about the

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,849
different kinds of open-source projects

00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,150
they were I was wondering what do you

00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:56,369
consider things like OpenOffice and

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,680
asterisk the types of systems that are

00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:00,570
you know corporately controlled and you

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,390
have to sign over all of your rights to

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:07,170
the corporation I mean are those healthy

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:09,090
for the open source environment well I'm

00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,710
not to do with Astra's and I'm vaguely

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,090
familiar with open or Open Office but I

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,099
don't think it falls I think it falls

00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,650
somewhere in the middle of the zero

00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,869
through four that we spoke about and I

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,430
think there's different ways there's

00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,530
different ways of doing it and I don't

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:25,380
know if one sort of healthy or unhealthy

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,760
and signing over your right so to speak

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,440
I mean that's sort of a separate issue

00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,849
because even like a free software

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,220
foundation ask you to sign them

00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:33,690
copyright well in a lot of cases it

00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,930
makes it difficult for other people that

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,790
would contribute otherwise to I mean

00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,740
like people like the free software

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,780
foundation I may trust because they are

00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,030
the free software foundation but Digium

00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,450
you're signing over your right and son

00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,300
also

00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,890
I mean we can get an illegal stuff

00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,460
forever but you can't sign away your

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,410
copyright this is a commissar you can

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,200
assign a copyright but whatever you give

00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,910
those rights to another company and

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,619
typically what those companies are when

00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,270
they deduce you know son is willing to

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,670
make staroffice out of it did um its

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,440
wanting to allow people to license the

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,359
code and do whatever they want with it

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,010
and they're probably philosophical

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,960
choice of yours okay it's like the big

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,089
there's a big argument I think between

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,339
open source and free software okay

00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,930
and I I've seen people within our

00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,820
company open source on the right and

00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,250
free software on the left and big fight

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,270
in the middle but so that really depends

00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,980
on what you're willing to do you know

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,260
which you're willing to be done with

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,180
your code if you don't want you know to

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,190
allow a company to realize as your coder

00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,810
that's have a thing or a project to do

00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,460
that you might want to go with the word

00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,230
of the free software license actually a

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,240
lot of companies will do this just just

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,310
for legal sanity not because they're

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,010
trying to control the project but

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,150
because contributor license agreements

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,880
are actually just sort of a necessary

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,320
evil in our legal system requires a

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,550
contributor License Agreement you know

00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,580
you're not assigning your copyright

00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,260
you're saying hey this organization that

00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,460
has the copyright on this code I'm

00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,220
giving you permission to use my

00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,900
contributions and

00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,430
unlimited way and there are legal

00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,080
reasons yeah and there are legal reasons

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,840
for that just because it's it makes it

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,599
easier to to defend the entire bar

00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,849
entire body of code is one entity right

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,410
one but when it comes down to the

00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:14,090
answers it's it depends on what you're

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,490
more comfortable with personally I

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,200
probably if there's something I wanted

00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,180
to write you know I'm okay with other

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,710
people using my code and whatever way

00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,119
they want some people are not some

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,470
people want the code to be free and

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,060
that's the people when the more the free

00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,880
software side he did he did mention

00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,099
OpenOffice I've heard stories that open

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,400
offices rewrite it's a lot of folks who

00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:36,470
work for son doing most of the coding

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,720
and I've heard stories that they are

00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:41,630
very comfortable working in consensus

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,340
based open source our ideal model and

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,890
that I've heard complaints about that

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,270
but it's all it's all hearsay so we

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:53,720
talked a little after if you feel

00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:56,900
absolutely other questions Gary little

00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:02,050
from Morgenthaler ventures once pointed

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:05,020
out that open source makes it easier to

00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:08,990
couple the requirements from the

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:12,470
customers to the actual development

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:15,200
process that you don't have a big

00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:17,060
heavyweight project management process

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,760
creating big heavyweight documents that

00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,619
are then thrown over to development how

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,960
do you take something like a

00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:27,369
consensus-based

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,780
development model and couple that to a

00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:31,849
Salesforce that's coming back into the

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,950
office and saying we can close this deal

00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,380
if we can just do this feature for this

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:41,540
customer this is what we experienced all

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:43,910
the time but what you want to okay okay

00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,410
well I mean this is actually something

00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,550
that's hard to explain the sales folks

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,470
you know I mean what do you mean we

00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:51,080
can't have this feature done by this

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,970
date and the answer is well we can try

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,830
it depends on how much influence we have

00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,780
in the community it depends on how much

00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,890
credibility we have depends on whether

00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,240
you know this is something that

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,520
everybody in the community wants for the

00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,630
product and this this is what you're

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,710
right about it I agree with the

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,119
statement about you know it brings the

00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,460
developers and the users close together

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,260
right you removes all those layers which

00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,020
is fantastic in terms of speeding things

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,900
up and getting a software better on the

00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,610
this is also that balancing act of

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,760
trying to maintain control and yet not

00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:23,110
really maintain control your business

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,430
plan needs to be flexible enough so that

00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:27,380
you have to give up certain things in

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,630
the short term like Gantt charts right

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,190
and specific schedules in return for

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,870
long term gain like well we know the

00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,100
project is moving in a direction that is

00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,810
going to help our company in the long

00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,580
term we just can't make specific

00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,860
promises and there's there's two sides

00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:43,790
to this if someone is is requesting a

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:45,770
feature what say for example it say

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,030
you've you sponsored an open-source

00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,350
project you've got an out there you've

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,820
got a bunch of people that don't work

00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,220
for your company working in the software

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,020
and one of your sales guys comes up and

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:57,080
closes multi-million dollar deal if we

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,030
add this feature to the product well the

00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,650
community involved in the in in the

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,620
software and your internal developers

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,440
will know this they can gauge whether or

00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,270
not it's something innocuous or possibly

00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,980
useful that the community will tolerate

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,720
if you contribute the development and

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:15,200
testing resources to make get it done

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,180
however if it's completely orthogonal to

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,920
the goals of the product the odds of

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,020
getting and in there or or antithetical

00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,000
for example the odds of you getting in

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,320
there are pretty pretty slim you're

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,090
gonna wind up with a revolt on your

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,040
hands I think yeah that's the best way

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,810
to describe it if the customer says we

00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,820
need X and X is aligned with the

00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,290
project's goals no problem you'll get it

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,110
quick it's like it's not aligned you'll

00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,430
never get it I mean locking subversion

00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,250
Ben and I wrote the locking feature in

00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,990
subversion 1.2 and most of the community

00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,970
could not have cared less about locking

00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,500
I mean they really like locking we don't

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,120
use it we reverse check Reserve

00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,440
checkouts who cares right it was there

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,760
because colliding its customers said

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,770
well we really need this feature for

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,360
certain things right and it's we

00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,240
implemented in a fashion that that's

00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,980
useful enough for anyone to use it but

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,510
it wasn't there wasn't out of scope of

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,620
the mission right right it's not a scope

00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,540
and people it's a version control

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,430
feature people accepted the feature

00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,900
provided that CollabNet was willing to

00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,490
work on it right and that's what we did

00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,320
we wrote this we did have a couple of

00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,790
volunteers to help us out and somehow I

00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,060
don't know why but just because they're

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:19,070
great people other question questions

00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:22,100
you Thanks well my question is about any

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,780
companies like Google they do most of

00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,130
the things in-house but something's

00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,230
open-source

00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,109
but actually they give a gift today

00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:33,410
other companies and they put a lot of

00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:34,940
effort on time and money to people to be

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,369
involved in the open-source community

00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,720
and develop but actually you're given

00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:44,079
some gift to their competitors so what's

00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,029
the question why do we do it yeah

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,460
where's the balance here I mean if

00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:52,720
Google will put a lot of effort in open

00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,700
source it's like giving a free gift

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,200
other companies well this goes back to

00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,089
your goals why are you open sourcing

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,529
something right if you take the view

00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,900
that all software is some sort of

00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:04,160
competitive advantage then no you're

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,490
never going to open-source anything

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,109
right

00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,789
but there are reasons to release things

00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:11,720
as open source if you've determined that

00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:14,180
is your company will benefit in the long

00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,609
run by everybody having the software or

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,460
by changing the industry right saying

00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:20,990
releasing something like Firefox

00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,789
web-browser right

00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,710
it changes the industry it makes

00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:26,599
everybody use standards that's good for

00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,579
a company like Google for example right

00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:29,509
rather than here's our proprietary web

00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:31,759
browser we're gonna keep it to ourselves

00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:33,500
and try and sell it I mean it's it's

00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:35,420
just a different way of helping yourself

00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,819
not all ways of helping yourself are

00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,319
necessarily you know all right and I

00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:40,970
mean a lot of the stuff you've seen

00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,410
open-source from Google you don't see a

00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,609
lot of software coming out of Google

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,980
because that's typically driven by

00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,480
engineers and would decide I want this

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,740
to be open sourced and we're like well

00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,970
okay but you have to do the work and

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,319
you're like oh I don't know if I have

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,119
time to do all that work cuz it's a fair

00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:54,259
bit of work to to get things out there

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,160
and again if you just push it over the

00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:57,230
wall who cares

00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,359
Google does a lot of other things for

00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,589
open-source the product that Ben and I

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,079
have been working on for years project

00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:04,490
hosting on code.google.com

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,740
we've got Summer of Code which Leslie

00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,720
runs which is a fantastically successful

00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,150
project we had 800 something students

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,180
this year you know nine hundred five

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,769
students excuse me it paid to write open

00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,059
source code over the summer and many of

00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:18,500
them were introduced to it for the first

00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,880
time so there's a lot of different

00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,289
things that we do when we do it because

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,940
open source is good for us well I think

00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:25,279
a Google web toolkit is a great example

00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,200
right so some company might have come up

00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:28,430
with Google Google web toolkit and said

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,349
oh this is great you know we can make

00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,940
millions of dollars let's sell it and

00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:34,130
Google's approach was hey this is great

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,990
let's release it let's make it easy for

00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,029
everybody in the world to write Ajax

00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,510
apps and thereby increase the amount of

00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:40,550
content

00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,260
and information that's produced and just

00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,850
make the web a stronger platform for

00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,380
everybody which helps Google in the long

00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,970
run because that's that's how Google

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,010
makes it does its business it's on the

00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:51,920
web right so it's it's just a different

00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,000
kind of strategy yeah any more google

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,080
specific questions that I asked you to

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,460
wait till the end of the talk because

00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,030
this is more about open source in

00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,620
general

00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:03,110
thank you I had a question about your

00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:05,060
take on the role charisma plays in the

00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:09,290
success of an open source project

00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:12,650
you mentioned leanness you're both

00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:18,140
pretty charismatic guys would you say

00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:19,880
that having people who have that have

00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,370
whatever it takes to create a cult of

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,720
personality around the lead developer is

00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:28,760
that necessary or just a feature I I

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,590
don't think the cult of personality is

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,540
necessary for a successful community I

00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:35,120
think he can sometimes help can

00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:39,260
sometimes hurt I think he can hurt a

00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:41,090
community when the community is it

00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,380
becomes dependent on that personality

00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,200
right if that person get hits it gets

00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,430
hit by a bus then suddenly the community

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,020
can't function because no one's telling

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,400
them what to do that's not really much

00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,290
of a consensus-based community that's

00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,430
sort of the enlightened despot model

00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,970
that I was talking about earlier it's

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,990
not sustainable but I think there are

00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,910
communities where there are very

00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,740
charismatic leaders but the leaders do

00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,120
not actually have any more weight in

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,280
decision-making than anybody else

00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:08,210
they're more like figureheads they're

00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:11,780
motivators they're you know I think I

00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:13,160
think that any community at forms forms

00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,650
is gonna start small

00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,420
one two three four developers and the

00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,010
community that grows around that whether

00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,560
it's a open source product or company

00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,180
light as large as Google and that

00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,070
community is going to be a reflection of

00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,560
those people that started it and if

00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,210
those people are charismatic friendly

00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,290
respectful and humble and that sort of

00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,910
thing you're gonna wind up with a

00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,710
community that looks somewhat like that

00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,090
if those people are you're

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,400
gonna wind up with a community of these

00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:41,330
people the disadvantage to having

00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,760
community built around sort of this jerk

00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:46,280
factor I guess I'd say is that that

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,900
tends tough to turn off a lot of people

00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,690
and it turns them away before they even

00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,400
get to your door and I don't think it's

00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:55,279
it's a wise decision

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,920
to form a community that's likely to

00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:59,599
turn away a lot of people and people get

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,009
into a lot of why don't search some

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,269
people coming up with syrup we've spoken

00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:03,950
about this at conferences

00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:06,049
why aren't thermal women an open source

00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:09,589
the average in the Kotaku engineering is

00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:12,890
10% women in open source it's 2% and

00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:16,220
there's a lot of discussion around why

00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:18,200
that might be and and I personally think

00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,220
that if you can have developer

00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,859
communities that are more concentrated

00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,990
on getting work done respecting each

00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:25,759
other and working with people I think it

00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,920
was likely to test something is it for

00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,480
something yeah yelling and insisting

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,609
it's gonna be my way and everyone else

00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,799
they're stupid and it drives people away

00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:35,450
it does drive people away and or

00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:37,940
attracts a certain kind of dysfunctional

00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,650
person right exactly I mean so if a

00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,779
community is built on a bunch of people

00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,400
who you know it's a lot of hazing and

00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:44,720
yelling and screaming and chest-thumping

00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,190
you're gonna wind up with a reflection

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,140
of that that's gonna be your community

00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,089
and you're gonna attract those people

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,319
and I'm glad that there's places for

00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:54,980
those people to go cuz I don't want to

00:47:51,319 --> 00:48:00,799
work with them my opinion we have other

00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:02,359
questions and the questions in terms of

00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:04,039
kick-starting a community so if you're

00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:05,779
thinking about open sourcing some chunk

00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:07,039
of code you talked about how do you

00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:08,720
decide how do you decide who our

00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,539
committees are not to you take existing

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,829
employees I mean you know cuz to try and

00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:14,809
follow your best practice you talked

00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:16,789
about the option for you know you're

00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,200
gonna end up seeding it with employees I

00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:20,450
guess to start with is that how you guys

00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,799
did it yeah you just have to you need to

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,359
choose employees who you think are gonna

00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,920
be not just good coders but good

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,640
community managers people who are nice

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,839
people you know trust each other with

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,059
others play well with others are

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,150
respectful of each other our humble are

00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:36,739
not crazy tyrants I mean if you find a

00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,329
small group of employees who are really

00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:40,670
nice to work with people you wouldn't

00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:43,069
want to work with right and you say hey

00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,230
please start a community then you'll get

00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:46,730
a good seed or things will grow well

00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,559
from that and I've seen examples where

00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,450
corporations will actually take one or

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,769
two people who are jerks and say please

00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,380
start a community and the community

00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:55,519
becomes less fit set a bunch of jerks

00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,499
all yelling at each other so you'd be

00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,789
very careful if we start with but you

00:48:57,499 --> 00:49:01,160
find that to be there okay for

00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:02,960
kick-starting it yeah that's they can be

00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,279
employees or not you just need to make

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,930
sure you're very careful about who you

00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:07,520
start with kick-started

00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:09,319
most important to put the work in to who

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,059
who is this initial core team because

00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:12,770
they're gonna define the team in the

00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:14,329
future but yes giving all those people

00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,290
connects just gonna start a sort of the

00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,819
way you have to start you've got to

00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:18,260
start some got a start you know but you

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,869
want to start probably narrower as

00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,309
opposed to broader and and again choose

00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:24,230
these same things carefully the other

00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:26,780
disadvantage so one does advantage I

00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,890
have a community of well points they

00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,450
poisons people because that's their the

00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,980
talk that's our favorite term of

00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,540
poisonous people is not only that you

00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,700
can you're going to turn a lot of people

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,500
away is that you're gonna have a lot of

00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,630
wasted energy on arguing and yelling and

00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,099
screaming and chest-thumping and it's

00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,990
much better to divert and direct this

00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:44,480
energy into writing sought writing and

00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,589
designing good software so just

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,280
something communities usually don't last

00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:48,530
very long

00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:54,079
it depends sometimes they do I think

00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:55,670
they fizzle was any other question well

00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,869
we'll be around for a bit to check that

00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,490
we've dropped it in here but thanks to
