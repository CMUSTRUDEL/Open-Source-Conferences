ABSTRACT

Every open source project runs into people who are selfish, uncooperative, and disrespectful. These people can silently poison the atmosphere of a happy developer community. Come learn how to identify these people and peacefully de-fuse them before they derail your project. Told through a series of (often amusing) real-life anecdotes and experiences.

welcome to the fourth instance in the

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,740
open-source developers at Google speaker

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,960
series which is our talks sessions

00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,580
designed to give the public insights

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,750
into what open-source developers who

00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,520
have been hired by Google are doing in

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,900
their daily lives this evening we are

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,610
privileged to have with us ben

00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,640
collins-sussman and brian fitzpatrick

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,290
who are two of the engineers behind our

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,360
project hosting feature on Google Code

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,620
site as well as the version developers

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,930
and they are here to talk to you about

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,080
how your open-source project can survive

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:57,140
poisonous people

00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,900
thanks listen thanks Lesley go ahead so

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,720
you have the remote No all right great

00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,059
here we go so start off with who are we

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,980
we have not forgotten who we are my name

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:09,229
is Brian Fitzpatrick Ben and I are

00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,170
currently Google engineers in Chicago

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:14,090
and we both work on the backend of the

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,460
Google Code hosting as well as other

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,850
bits and pieces of things related to

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,350
open source here at Google yeah and we

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,650
should talk about the next line which is

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,210
the fact that these are opinions that

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,770
we've come to on our own after many

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,690
years of sort of participating in open

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,890
source projects and we found these

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,720
issues coming up over and over again so

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,980
we decided to put a talk together and

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,500
it's it's gone pretty well for us so

00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,760
obviously this is not the only way to

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,590
run a community it's the way that we've

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,850
found to be the best way that we think

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,860
and so we're trying to share that with

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,230
you guys and maybe do a little group

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:53,210
therapy see and get some Q&A after the

00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:54,410
session and this book is written by a

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,570
friend of ours named karl fogel and we

00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,460
recommend it highly it talks about a lot

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,740
of the things we're talking about as

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,630
well as even more details technical

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,800
details about running a project and we

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,800
recommend it if you don't have it

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:11,230
already and yeah I think that's all we

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,580
need to say great should move up Google

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,840
so we'll start off with it doing a quick

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,180
overview of what we're going to look at

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,760
there are four different stages that we

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,209
visit in protecting your project the

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,970
first stage is comprehension to

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,190
understand what what poisonous people

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,040
are what we need to protect against in

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,840
the first place beyond that is how do

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,710
you fortify your project against

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,150
poisonous people

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,520
you obviously want to attract other

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,040
people to your project to work on it

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,600
not necessarily the poisonous kind how

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,880
do you identify those poisonous people

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,970
and lastly if your projects already

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,430
infected how do you get them out and

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,200
every one of those is a certain level of

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,980
trickiness to it I would have to say

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,740
yeah so let's talk about understanding

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,660
the threat so you got your open source

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,540
project what is the most important

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,070
resource it's not your hardware it's the

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,160
attention and focus of your community

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,600
and this is what you are trying to

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,760
protect in the first place from the

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,380
poisonous people

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,090
there's a limited resource here right if

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,310
20 people are trying to implement 20

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,840
hugely divergent features at once or if

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,320
everybody's squabbling all the time

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,850
you will get nowhere in your project so

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,620
what is wrong with poisonous people

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,570
what should so poisonous people will

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,070
show up and they'll distract your to

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,200
distract your developers from doing

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,120
productive work they can cause emotional

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,230
drain because they'll start in fighting

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,580
or squabbling or that sort of thing and

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,470
with what they do is basically the

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,730
you're going down a certain Road and

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,050
they're going to either stop you slow

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,060
you down or try and turn you off a

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,250
different Road and some people do do

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,470
this on purpose some people will do this

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:56,030
on accident yep so um paralysis this is

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,410
the problem if you not always I guess

00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,240
the best way to say this is these people

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,800
who are disrupting your progress are not

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,120
always doing it intentionally in fact I

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,940
think it's more often that they're doing

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,230
it unintentionally they are so into the

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,700
project and they want it to be so

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,290
perfect that they'll actually end up

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,700
hurting you with their perfectionism or

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,070
people trying to get the process just

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,480
perfect and this is one of one of the

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,650
people in our project actually has says

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,150
you should not let the perfect be the

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,380
enemy the good and that sort of become

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,700
at least with the subversion project

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,240
that sort of become one of our

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,890
watch.watch phrases and I guess there's

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,680
an example we had where I guess somebody

00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,180
proposed a feature and I won't go into

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,380
details but there is a certain person in

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,590
the subversion project who does

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,230
fantastic stuff we love him but we ended

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,880
up sort of needling pushing at the

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,790
design document it went on for weeks and

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,960
then months and it became clear that it

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,970
was never going to be no one was ever

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,310
going to start coding this process and

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,400
because this one person would not let

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,330
the design document

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,190
not stop picking at it so ultimately in

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,770
a situation like that the best thing you

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,660
can do is get support from a large

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,280
percentage of developers in a project

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,690
and if they're happy with it somebody

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,389
just needs to sit down and code it and

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,310
ignore the noisy minority and that's and

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,020
one of the things that we like to talk

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,340
about here we have a lot of different

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,229
catchphrases that we pull out in

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,610
subversion when we need to sort of set

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,740
the talk down and get going with the

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,660
doing and one of those is we talk about

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,850
painting the bike shed up who here knows

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,800
what painting the bike shed means any

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,449
any bsd folks in the room alright so

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,979
painting the bike shed that I'll give

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,919
you a quick overview on this back in the

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,720
and the bsd and bsd days Paul Henning

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,190
camp wrote this wonderful email they

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,419
were having this huge fight over whether

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,010
sleep should take seconds or

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,840
microseconds I believe or seconds and

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,419
milliseconds it went on and on and on

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,250
and on and on and so the way he

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,810
described it was that if you're going to

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,370
build a nuclear power plant these guys

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,039
go off to all this research bring this

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,150
gargantuan binder of information and

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,530
they to the board and they say we're

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,760
going to build a nuclear power plant the

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,750
board of the electric company looks at

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,150
it like oh yeah it looks great go ahead

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,410
and build the nuclear power plant and

00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,700
two weeks later they come in they say

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,770
you know look we got this nuclear power

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,940
plant we're building it the workers want

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,320
a little bike shed for them to keep

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,419
their bikes in so the rain doesn't get

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,889
on the bikes here the blueprint so

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,660
here's just pictures of the bike shed

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,460
we're going to draw and it will go the

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,950
discussion of what color to paint this

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,320
bike shed will take forever so let's

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,450
distill that down is that the amount of

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,820
discussion on a particular feature is

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,419
inversely inversely proportional to its

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,870
complexity and we definitely seem to

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,870
have a question

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:36,889
all parties know the guy this is for

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,669
this is the park in Parkinson law never

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,089
heard of that okay

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:44,150
no is it he said it's a tribute it to

00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:46,550
its original the original author monitor

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,960
this idea was a Parkinson never heard of

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,400
this known as fourth part the fourth law

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,169
of Parkinson yeah it's just the fact

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,309
that in a group people are really when

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,749
they're working in a committee people

00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:56,120
want to put their stamp and sort of

00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:58,219
prove like I'm I'm I'm participating see

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,559
and it's very easy to put your opinion

00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:02,270
in on blueprints for a bike shed than to

00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:04,520
put your opinion in on blueprints for a

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,199
power plant so we we try we tend to call

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,699
people early and often when they're in

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,080
your bike shedding something we'll even

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,520
call ourselves you know I'd prefer to

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,069
have this this way but it's total bike

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,129
 and our friend Carl set up actually

00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,830
WWE bike shed calm and you can pick just

00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:21,020
about any normal color and go color bike

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,870
shed calm and you'll get that color it's

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,370
lovely so don't get bogged down in

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,669
perfectionism that's the moral of the

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,289
slide so let's talk about fortifying

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,629
against the threat how do you keep your

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,939
open source community resistant to

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,199
infection and this is sort of this

00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,060
section of our talk we talk just about

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,879
things that habits that we think make

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,879
very healthy open-source communities

00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,589
very prescriptive so these are the four

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,060
things I'm going to flip up the four

00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,740
things that we think make a healthy

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,959
open-source community and you would be

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,499
surprised if you take a poll of open

00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:58,209
source projects how many are missing one

00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:59,899
or more of these elements or all of it

00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:02,300
if they're missing all of them they

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:03,589
don't last very long but most problems

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,539
that you find in open source projects

00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,249
can be traced back to a deficiency in

00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,259
one of these things so let's let's go

00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:11,930
into some detail why don't you talk

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,129
about it fits all right so best practice

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,110
now this is one of the things that I

00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,309
preach day to day around here when I'm

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,379
talking to people about open source

00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:20,270
something is have a mission have a

00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,620
direction if you go out there and you

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,779
want to just write some software well

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,919
that's great but if you don't know where

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,509
you're going you're never going to know

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,550
we are there when you finally get there

00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,139
so first thing I tell people to do is

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,209
pick a direction so where are you going

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,250
to go and then limit your section with a

00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:37,729
scope so that you don't wind up in

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,289
limitless feature creep or people adding

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,519
a lot of things on that you or didn't

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,950
intend to do so you really have to think

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,780
about where you want to go with your

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,520
object and I have a couple of examples

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,290
of projects that I've personally been

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,630
involved with and the first one

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,190
obviously is subversion and this is

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,870
subversions mission statement it was on

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,240
the front page of the subversion project

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,920
for six years well at least it was the

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,370
first four years was very relevant as we

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,710
worked towards 1.0 and that saved us a

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,910
lot of grief we'd have somebody come up

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,500
and say yeah you guys you're going to

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,060
write this new version control system we

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,160
have to integrate make with it and a

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,320
compiler and it should pretty pictures

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,540
and do PNG jpg conversion and should do

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,860
clearcase features and everything and so

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,210
we could point back to this and say look

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,730
we're going to write a version control

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,560
system but our limiter is that we're

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,120
trying to write CVS without the cruddy

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,650
features or they're quite a missed

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,050
features or the bug and in fact we

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,850
actually enumerated the exact features

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,040
we wanted and the exact problems with

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,050
CVS that we were trying to address so

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,940
from day one if somebody came along with

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,040
suggestion to the list we could say it's

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,330
on it's on our list or it's not on our

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,800
to-do list and if it's not on the do

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,650
list we say thanks come back later after

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,330
1.0 and we can talk so this is it's a

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,010
it's a way of you free to communicate

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,050
with new developers coming to your

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,610
project this is what we're doing if you

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,470
want to take part in this that's great

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,020
please join us you're not interested

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,930
then save your own time and ours and go

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,310
somewhere else basically the second

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,490
thing a project is the Google web

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,840
toolkit which I had the honor of working

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,190
with this team and helping them bring

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,740
their project completely open-source

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,600
from stem to stern this December and

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,160
I've talked with those guys and I gave

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,080
them this sort of same talk I said let's

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,210
pick a direction and a scope and refine

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,770
that makes it as clear as we can because

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,720
people are going to want to come on and

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,980
work with you guys but we want to make

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,990
sure that they're working with you and

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,270
not against you so as you can see the

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,580
direction that they chose is you know

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,400
the no compromise Ajax development

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,200
environment in Java in Java the scope

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,480
limitation they chose was Java in a

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,190
modern browser so that sets the stage

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,180
for some of the things they want to do

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,980
and some of the things they don't want

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,350
to do and like the subversion project

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,150
they go on to explain what what this

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,470
means and what what it doesn't mean so

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,880
what are the goals and non goals for the

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,080
project so this is basically it's you're

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,030
ensuring that your community has

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,070
something to focus on if you're trying

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,540
to preserve attention and focus the best

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,130
way to do that is to have something to

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,410
focus on right I mean it's that's it

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,610
um on mailing lists this is a problem I

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,230
mean this is your main communication

00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,820
method right in any open source project

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,520
I mean you have IRC or instant message

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,100
but majority of official communication

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,150
really happens on mailing lists and

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,670
these are just some general practices

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,990
we've run into when people come along to

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,570
me and let's point them to the archives

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,890
do not let them reopen old discussions

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,060
unless they really know what they're

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,890
talking about and they've really seen

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,840
the former discussion because if they

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,910
come along and they say you know let's

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,650
talk about X Y & Z and they and they

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,000
haven't read the previous discussions

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,500
it's really it's just a matter of

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,230
disrespect they're disrespecting

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,640
everyone else's time in the project so

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,290
don't let that happen

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,850
another thing that you'll see happening

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,120
is sometimes if there's dissent in the

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,760
discussion you'll see one very vehement

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,010
dissent er who will sit there the entire

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,170
time and respond to every single mail

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,430
and the thread to anyone who disagrees

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,650
with him even people who do agree with

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,610
him he will keep reply to every and so

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,800
you'll end up with a thread with you

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,090
know 50 messages in it and exactly half

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,610
of them are from the same person and

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,890
it's ridiculous we call it yes

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,420
filibustering and we'll call people out

00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,040
on that we'll say you know what read the

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,200
thread think about your response

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,540
carefully write a nice single response

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,160
so we can keep going it's it's a way

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,390
it's sort of a technique of making it

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,220
look like there's more dissension when

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,020
there is and you should not what that

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,050
happened it's a technique that poisonous

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,430
people can use to derail consensus-based

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,230
community from actually achieving

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,270
consensus because like Ben said you have

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,440
this noisy minority now they're making a

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,000
lot of noise and people look and say oh

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,500
wow there seems to be no agreement on

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,510
this and if you look carefully you see

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,590
that the no agreement is coming from one

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,740
person and while seven or eight other

00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,100
people likely agree on something all

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,780
right go ahead

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,030
all right so documentation is really

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,200
important if you don't document things

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,880
first of all the first part of the

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,030
documentation is your sort of direction

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,530
your mission the second part is what

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,790
else how else can you communicate with

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,500
people about what you're doing and what

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,030
you want to do so design decisions

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,510
that's your design Docs what you're

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,790
going to do with with your software

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,530
bugfixes documenting what you fix how

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,970
you fixed it having an issue tracker and

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,190
almost having an issue tracker at all

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,480
right documenting your mistakes so this

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,300
is something that people frequently

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,770
overlooked because who wants to document

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,030
your mistakes who wants to say spend

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,970
time writing up we went down this path

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,860
Bono is a dead end and

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,420
backed up and kept going on well the

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,920
problem is is if you don't document this

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,209
whether it's even just in your mailing

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,740
list archives or you write about it

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,569
somewhere or blog it or whatever not

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,160
someone's going to come back and want to

00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,720
have this discussion all over again

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,819
and that's going to distract from your

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,490
focus and needlessly take up your energy

00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:23,540
and of course you know not everybody in

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,850
the project is going to be there forever

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,379
so you might imagine a time when the

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,699
people participating now will be

00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,740
replaced by a completely different set

00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:33,740
of people who will want that history to

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,870
look at so right yeah and I don't

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,360
changes of course we we recommend

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,720
picking a standard format for your log

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,610
messages that people should follow and

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,959
interesting in the past Tom Ben and I

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,490
worked at a different company where we

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,990
dealt with we dealt with different

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,000
clients and we said you know yeah you

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,139
should use this use use of methods have

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,300
some sort of way of people writing

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,399
consistent log messages and this guy

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,980
said I can't get my developers to write

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,779
consistent log messages and our friend

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,939
Karl just about choked on his own tongue

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,009
because he's like I have a broken source

00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:06,379
project over here with 35 unpaid

00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,930
volunteers who followed this insanely

00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:11,509
detailed log message specification for

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,040
every check-in that they do so don't

00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,139
tell me that you have a problem with

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,850
your paid developers and I can get these

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:20,529
people coming off the internet for free

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:24,819
to do this yep absolutely

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:29,750
okay that's cute

00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:32,660
yeah okay so we get that so code

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,980
collaboration this is something that if

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,089
you participate in open source you know

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,309
this commit emails are the best way to

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,189
have people realize what other people

00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:45,589
are working on most open source projects

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,660
do not review each other's changes

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:48,920
before checking them in you what happens

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,660
is you know somebody builds up trust

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,850
they get commit access they start

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,639
committing patches into the version

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,870
control system and people trust that

00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,360
they're not screwing things up and what

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,889
happens then is an email goes out and it

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,029
goes into everyone's mailbox all the

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,559
other developers and they can sort of

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,759
see oh here's what this person is doing

00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,470
and depending on their level of interest

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,180
they might review the code or not but

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,309
the fact that it pushes these code

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,259
reviews and people's face is a huge deal

00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,149
much much more likely to get

00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,279
participation in code review than

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:17,670
developers going in and reading what

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,560
someone else has already done

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,530
so that's that is a very important

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,670
technique and another thing you should

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:28,950
not do is let people submit power plants

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,810
another use of the term power plant here

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,000
but same basic idea

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,670
don't let developers go off for three

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,530
months in the corner and quietly develop

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,060
some huge mega feature and then suddenly

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,550
appear one day and commit the whole

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,710
thing and it's so big nobody can review

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,390
it nobody has the time or the energy to

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,280
even understand what it's doing and that

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,630
that's terrible because you want

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,220
everyone in your project to know what's

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,890
going on in pretty much every corner of

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,840
the code and not just one person who

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,070
might get hit by a bus and then how are

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,170
you going to support that feature so

00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,700
this is this is part of just keeping

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,220
people in the loop and the way to do

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,360
that is you know say hey I'm going to

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,310
work on this feature for three months

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,750
let me do it on a branch over here and

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,970
you guys can watch me do it

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,010
incrementally without disrupting the

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:15,720
rest of you so don't be afraid of

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,160
branches oh I just said that so that's

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,680
it

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,540
bus factor you want Elmo to bus pectoris

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,050
sure so so I actually wrote an article

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,550
about the bus factor the the bus factor

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,280
of your project or a part of your

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,990
project is the number of developers that

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,560
have to get hit by a bus to leave you in

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,600
a world of crap so for example

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,580
subversions file system code the

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,820
Berkeley DB file system code for a while

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,290
had a bus factor of 1 and that was Mike

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,370
pilato and we were a little bit worried

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,330
about him because he crossed the street

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,280
frequently so what did we do to prevent

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,110
this is we did our best to start working

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,750
to lower the barrier to start working on

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,160
the the Berkeley DB file system we went

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,070
through and made sure that the code was

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,360
commented well and as clear as possible

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,610
Mike wrote a couple of different design

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,680
Docs expressing what we were doing in

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,270
there and we started we started

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,829
encouraging we actually asked some of

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,290
our developers if anybody would was

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,610
willing to start to work in the file

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,079
system with Mike and take a look at that

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,030
and some people took us up on that yeah

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,940
that's right encourage people to spread

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,949
their expertise around absolutely does I

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,540
mean and being hit by a bus I joke about

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,160
actually Mike being run over by a bus

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:27,959
but the anyway being hit by a bus can

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,330
take any number of forms someone can

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,380
have a new job someone can have a baby

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,630
someone can get married

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,130
lifestyle change life status change any

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,420
that sort of thing can take them away

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,550
from your project because most of the

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,200
time you are dealing with volunteers and

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,480
this this leads into the general idea of

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,060
the Galit Arianism we're talking about

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,100
people not owning certain parts of the

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,810
codebase it's okay to be an expert on

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,460
certain parts of the codebase but what

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,320
you'll often see happening both inside

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,240
corporations and in open source projects

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,920
certain people sort of marking off their

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,510
territories and saying this is mine and

00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,480
you can't touch it unless you talk to me

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,610
and that is a very very bad for

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,470
collaboration so one of the ways you can

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,180
discourage that is do not let people put

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,490
their names at the top of source code

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,290
files there are plenty of chances for

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,140
attribution there's always a file that

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,240
describes who the the main contributors

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,790
to the project are there's always the

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,260
the changelog the history on the version

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,270
control system records who commits what

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,890
when you can annotate the code and see

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,120
who wrote what when so it's not that

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,650
you're not going to get credit for what

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,170
you're doing if somebody isn't looking

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,790
but if you soon as you see a name in a

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,710
file it makes somebody nervous it makes

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,600
them think Oh should I really be trying

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,910
to fix this bug here without you know am

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,560
i stepping on somebody's toes if it's a

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,120
if everything's anonymous it really

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,130
feels like everybody owns everything

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,800
else and that's a great practice and

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,600
even even worse than that is the at what

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,730
point do I put my name in the file

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,920
problem is it a two line changes at a

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,650
four line change I reformatted the code

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,660
I wrote a comment right it's it and it

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,730
winds up to be a lot a lot of I think

00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,140
more petty stuff that you just don't

00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,100
have time for you don't want to focus on

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,960
that exactly so what's what's the

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,580
example the D parser oh the day parser

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,260
contributors so we had a guy come up

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,820
who's actually a very competent engineer

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,910
wrote some good code first version

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,000
because the subversion used the CVS date

00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,560
parser which was you know kind of a mess

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,390
but we we were we were we went ahead

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,560
with that and he came through he said

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,030
okay you know I see you guys want to

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,050
rewrite this clean it up a little bit

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,910
make it something a little more

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,320
maintainable and so he wrote this code

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,120
this whole file worth of code and he put

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,160
his name at the top and he sent it as a

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,180
patch for code review and we went

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,650
through and reviewed it and you know

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,270
we're like you okay fix this this is a

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,650
style issue in our code blah blah blah

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,970
blah blah and you know pull your name

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,800
out of the top you don't put names and

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,300
files he said what do you mean I wrote

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,890
the whole file I want my name in the

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,510
file we said well no you don't

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,610
understand this is how we do it it's

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,470
documented pointing a doctor point out

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,730
the documentation in our hacking

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,650
document of how to hack super

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,060
and that's just how we do it you don't

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,920
see names in any other files anywhere

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,270
and he's like well I don't care I wrote

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,460
this whole file I'm going to tribute it

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,340
I want my name in it so blackmail

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,350
basically and let's say that's great you

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,690
take your date parser and take it with

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,160
you and I've got another project - we'll

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,350
take it with your name in it because we

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,260
don't want the code we're not willing to

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,960
sacrifice our community tenets for your

00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,310
ego so it's hard to say no sometimes -

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,480
especially with his he writes good code

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,820
but the health of the community is more

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,410
important than one particular bug fix or

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,610
feature at a given moment it's looking

00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,260
at the long term rather than the short

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,550
term and another engineer will come by

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,990
and write it for you and show you that

00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:29,190
it happened yes took a little longer yep

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,510
okay well-defined process sees so this

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,570
is sort of goes without saying but not

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,040
all open-source projects really are very

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,570
professional about how they manage the

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,890
software they don't necessarily maintain

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,540
release branches they don't necessarily

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,040
even have a release process and it

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,050
depends on the size and scope and

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,790
maturity of the project but as the

00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,890
project grows you need to start thinking

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,270
about these things and figure out well

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,310
how are we going to release people how

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,810
are we going to manage bugs if they come

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,400
out are we going to release bug fixes to

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,940
people so it's something to think about

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,380
and then you also need think about how

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,750
how to get more people in the community

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,130
so people always start out coming to the

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,110
community say you know I've patched this

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,520
little problem here here's my patch and

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,410
they post it to the email list and you

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,450
want to be welcoming to them right I

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,740
mean you want your community grow and be

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,690
healthy and you want to help but you

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,640
want to not ignore them so in some cases

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,110
sometimes the community is so busy they

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,970
completely drop patches on the floor

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,830
people come in offer them they get

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,390
ignored that's bad

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,980
one way to fix that is to actually

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,480
assign somebody in your community to

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,460
notice patches that are being ignored

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,960
and put them in the bug tracker or

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,110
respond to the person after a certain

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,910
amount of time but then in general I

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,080
guess you need to come up with a policy

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,000
of how are you going to expand your

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,460
community in a more official sense what

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,650
does it mean for someone to be part of

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,940
the community community obviously it

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,260
means you know they're going to have

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,120
commit access to your source control

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,650
that's usually sort of the technical

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,060
definition of being a member of the

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:52,440
community but there's a lot of other

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:55,330
definitions right well what would you

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,310
talk about this part I'm thinking about

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,230
how the culture perpetuates right I mean

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,340
the culture of a Pecha waits because the

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,930
kind of people you're going to give

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,100
commit access to your project or people

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,930
that are going to be like yourselves

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,420
people have the same values of your

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,280
software who are you know going to abide

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,600
by your community rules they're the kind

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,460
of people show up with patches and

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,170
you'll iterate with on each on different

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,950
patches with them and after a while

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,660
they're going to start submitting

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,180
patches that need less attention before

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,820
they go in so you switch them from

00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,920
review then commit commit to commit then

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,620
review and the review takes place by the

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,140
rest of the committers but so it's the

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,020
self selecting community like as Ben and

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,190
I sort of do some through periods where

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,380
we do less work with the subversion

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,240
community we come back and keep an eye

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,700
on things and it's it's the same sort of

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,310
flavor to the community of the tone of

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,930
the mailing list right yeah and and now

00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,230
the anecdote that we have for this is

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,810
that even a founder can be booted so

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,950
we've talked about this in the past with

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,360
each other about what happens if

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,340
somebody kind of goes crazy you know you

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,110
can remove someone's commit access if

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,390
the group of committers votes on that

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm familiar with an open-source project

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,560
where the founder wrote almost all the

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,190
code for the project and then it became

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,120
a real larger open source project in

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,590
consensus-based and it attracted a

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,450
community and people did things and

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,710
releases and one day the founder decided

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,540
he wanted to do something different with

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,890
the software and that he was going to go

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,720
this direction and the whole community

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,880
went to go this direction but they were

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,410
afraid of angering him they felt like

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,230
you know he was the founder and they

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,310
sort of had kind of do what he did but

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,410
they really wanted to go this way and

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,280
they told him that and he threatened

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,890
them he said I'm going to veto

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,390
everything you do and prevent you from

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,770
doing a release because I'm going to you

00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,440
know put my foot down and prevent them

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,970
from happening and they a couple of guys

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,910
talked to me like you know what do we do

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,400
I'm like you vote and you throw him out

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm like let him if he wants to take his

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,760
toys in a certain direction that 10

00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,350
other people don't want to go in well

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,610
you know it's great these as a founder

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,590
sure you have a lot of respect for him

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,870
but he's not showing respect for your

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,360
community he's come in decided that he

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,760
wants to take charge and if you have a

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,320
benevolent dictatorship of a community

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,510
that's one thing but if you're working

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,670
in a consensus-based environment where

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:08,030
everyone it's it's it's sort of where

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,809
there's no um if there's no one guy that

00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,249
takes takes

00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:11,870
because it just goes to show that a

00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,429
poisonous person can suddenly appear

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,110
from within it doesn't have to be an

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,149
outsider coming into your community

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,039
somebody can go crazy that's one of the

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,169
reasons that we we both like consensus

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,669
based development because there's no one

00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,919
who's working on the actual code that's

00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,990
disenfranchised if everyone who's

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,200
writing the code has a say in direction

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,370
of the code as a whole then it you feel

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,820
like you have much more control over

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:39,259
your future yeah absolutely so every

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,450
consensus based community usually has

00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:44,029
some kind of a voting system at least

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,649
written into their charter or how they

00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:47,539
participate in this is this I think

00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:50,269
what's really started was Apache was the

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:52,820
first major set of organ of projects to

00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:54,590
do this and a lot of people will look at

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,450
this and say oh well we should just vote

00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,399
on everything right and that is not a

00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,990
good idea either a really healthy

00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,539
community if you're having healthy

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,850
discussions you are coming to

00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,860
resolutions relatively easy on easily on

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,360
most subjects if you find yourself

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,909
voting on everything all the time

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,789
something is wrong and you need to be a

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,049
little more introspective voting means

00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,669
there's a winner no loser voting means

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,049
is a winner exactly I mean people need

00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:19,549
to learn to make compromises and

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,840
hopefully you are bringing people in

00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,100
your community who are the kind of

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,659
people who like to make compromises and

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,999
are willing to deal with that if you're

00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:29,509
voting then you have a very strange

00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:32,179
culture I suppose and it's certainly in

00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:33,769
the subversion project I think the we

00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:36,049
were going for what maybe four or five

00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:38,509
years before we had our first actual

00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:40,519
vote we actually really all sat down

00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:43,490
took tallies and was very very careful

00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,129
about counting who was on what side and

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,049
this really really critical decision we

00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,399
had to make was how to format our source

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:52,340
code whether to put spaces before

00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:54,830
parentheses or not people were very very

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,119
passionate about this but if that's the

00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,029
only vote you ever have then you know

00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:01,070
you're in good shape right so I just I

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:03,559
find it humorous that that was our one

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,730
big vote weak emitters comes out it

00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,610
coming out of the woodwork we hadn't

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,169
seen been like emailed one guy we hadn't

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,759
committed subversion a year or so and

00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,909
said oh my god come you have to vote for

00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:15,289
this they came in and voted against bed

00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:19,250
so I was yeah they were partly was

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:21,049
politicking definitely so um all right

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,149
let's talk about

00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:26,339
how do notice people usually it's

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,439
obvious it's not always obvious this

00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,789
phrase beause of it is what fit says if

00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,959
he's reading a mailing list and it

00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,939
becomes obvious that somebody we're

00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:34,499
talking with is really just going to

00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:36,179
suck and drain our time and we're never

00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:38,009
going to get anywhere he just says I

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,579
flipped the bows a bit and just stops

00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:43,169
responding to the thread now I have to

00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,729
say this was a bad cop it's a great

00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,679
explainer I'm the bad cop and Ben's the

00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,509
good cop I read two males from God my

00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,509
guard this guy's a bozo and Penn psycho

00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:53,609
come on no we have to email him in yeah

00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:56,549
he's good and and it's it's a it's

00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:58,349
important to be tolerant because this

00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,149
guy who shows up and seems to be a bozo

00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:02,849
on his first or first one or two emails

00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:03,869
you might just be engaging you and it

00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:05,429
could turn out to be a very valuable

00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,879
committer and that has happened in the

00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:07,049
past

00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:08,759
so I think it's good to have a bit of

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:12,239
both bad and good cops in your community

00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,499
right people screaming when to watch out

00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,789
for problems but then other people who

00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:17,789
are willing to go a little farther and

00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:21,449
tolerating and I think skin helps to fix

00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:24,209
skin so here's some really obvious ways

00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:26,459
to tell that somebody might be not worth

00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,779
your time and the first the first

00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,969
telltale signs you'll see in the way

00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,459
they communicate right you'll see that

00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:34,889
their email address is like like crazy

00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:37,439
Jo 53 woo or some I mean it's just like

00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:38,759
what and then you know they join IRC and

00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:40,919
they have a completely different

00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,649
ridiculous nickname and you don't even

00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,859
realize it's the same person yes I just

00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:50,489
said that capital letters you know all

00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:54,059
this you've seen this before so just be

00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:56,519
careful of these folks this is a this is

00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,359
a pretty this gives a spam score that's

00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,359
pretty high yeah exactly

00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:05,039
go ahead Fitz some people again I talked

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,139
about engaging the community some of

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,689
might show up and not be able to pick up

00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:11,519
in the mood for example if we are in the

00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,779
final crunch to release we were in the

00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,089
final crunch to release for want to

00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:17,459
version 1.0 and people are trying our

00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:19,319
best to focus on you know getting our

00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:21,809
release I mean subversion did take four

00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,639
years to get with a 1.0 granted our 1.0

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,799
is like you know five point six for some

00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:27,419
software it's version control you lose

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,729
people's data they're not coming back

00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,869
be very careful um yes so so we had

00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:32,219
people somebody come in we're like in

00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:34,040
this last crunch like I think you should

00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:36,560
completely rewrite your back-end

00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,410
from scratch like it's great why don't

00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,460
you come back tomorrow so if they just

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,620
obviously don't understand they don't

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,980
see a pickup on the tone you don't Steve

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,420
see the what you're doing they ask a lot

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,580
of questions that they could be looking

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,590
up and that that shows an impedance

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,060
mismatch but it also shows an it could

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:57,920
be an indication of a lack of respect

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:59,480
for other people's time mm-hmm so

00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,310
sometimes you see people who are openly

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,590
hostile these happen they're not as

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,120
common as you think but it does happen

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,500
they'll come in and say this project is

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,910
ridiculous it's the worst thing I've

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,190
ever seen I can't believe you guys are

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,740
doing XYZ you did it all wrong are you

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,270
getting it you know as well we did yeah

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,820
we did have somebody submit a patch once

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:18,500
and he didn't like the way he used

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,610
malloc and free for those of you RC

00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,440
programmers and we were using memory

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,880
pools and we said you'll have to rewrite

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,220
this using the memory system we're using

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,080
and he this is so stupid I'm not going

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,400
to do this and let walked away oh okay

00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,350
fine I guess

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,420
I guess it wasn't a good match for our

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,310
community anyway but sometimes you'll

00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,660
see people who are or have a sense of

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,890
entitlement they'll come in and say well

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,570
I'm going to write this feature and I

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,460
demand that you help me right now and

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,900
what is wrong with this thing and what's

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,000
wrong why isn't this working for me tell

00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,810
me now now now now again disrespecting

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,250
people's time bad attitude

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,800
blackmail sometimes people will come to

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,950
the community and say well I like your

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,290
project but it doesn't have this feature

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,750
so unless you add this feature I'm not

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,790
going to have my fortune 500 company use

00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,710
it or I was going to contribute ten of

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,660
my best developers to work on it but you

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,850
know it's not the way we like it so you

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,290
too you lose I mean there's nothing you

00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,490
can do about that again once again you

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,740
think about the long term and not the

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,300
short term what is the direction you

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,650
want for your project what is what do

00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,690
you want your community to be like don't

00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:21,590
let people blackmail or hijack those

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,030
long term goals from you yeah it's easy

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,500
sometimes you can see people are just

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,570
trolling just trying to get your your

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,810
rile you up and you need to ignore that

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,060
and then this is my favorite you'll

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,490
actually see if somebody gets identified

00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,320
as a poisonous person and the community

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,610
just starts to sort of ignore the person

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,290
hoping they'll go away

00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,230
one of the first reactions you'll see is

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,580
that you know it's a cabal and obviously

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,600
the small group of people has hijacked

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,000
the project because they're not

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,120
interacting with me anymore and they'll

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,190
make wonderful conspiracy accusations

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,520
and it's amusing it's also very sad but

00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:01,680
but yeah be on the lookout for that

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,090
go ahead all right so so you do wind up

00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,860
with a lot of conceited developers who

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,810
aren't going to acknowledge the opinions

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,640
of other people you know I've been doing

00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,320
this for so many years and this and that

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,270
and I clearly understand more about it

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,250
than you do and you know your opinions

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,480
are great but you don't matter and

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,710
they're going to make sweeping claims

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,000
about the products he said this is my

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,150
favorite they're like you know if

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,030
subversion integrates with ant it would

00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,350
take over the world you know and we're

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,110
like yeah that's great come back

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,060
tomorrow that they'll start to pull open

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,550
these topics that you've gone over years

00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,600
ago and whatnot and basically you've got

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,710
to put into the archives because they

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,790
haven't read through the archives and

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,320
that's understandable what someone

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,640
hasn't necessarily read your archives

00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,350
but when you point them in the archives

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,050
and they come back me see yeah but no

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:47,040
it's different loud loud and I've got

00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:49,290
cold fusion and you know again it's it's

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,270
a matter of having the strength to of

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,680
your canoe community to to not be so

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,050
desperate for people that you could say

00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,730
my community and art the goal our values

00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,890
are more important than this other you

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,770
know warm or semi warm body in some

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,540
cases might be good keep going nice nice

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,160
so a lot of people are willing to

00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,010
complain and not help fix these are the

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,590
talkers and not the doers these people

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,760
you have to ignore has to leave or make

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,860
them made understand that this is a

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,550
development list and this is not a group

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,230
therapy session some people just want to

00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,390
some case I sort of want to be heard

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,490
especially if there's a real bug in

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,870
question in that case that's that's a

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,130
role of working people into the issue

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,870
tracker and that sort of thing and

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,430
letting them know they're heard but um

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,350
if they're going to cut you know go

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,910
ahead and complain or they want to they

00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,680
want to go off and write a whole pile of

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,300
code by themselves because everybody

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,830
likes to code but who wants to sit down

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,760
and discuss a design with the people

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,470
who've been working the product you

00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,910
might have to argue at someone and so

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,900
yeah you want to argue that god you know

00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,160
whatever I'm going to go off and write

00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,260
this code and I'll come back and I'll

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,340
I'll let you see it when I'm done you

00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,830
know and that's great I'll be glad to

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,620
like you know press the Delete key when

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,020
you're done because you haven't taken

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,790
the time to talk to us about Ben and I

00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,020
we were at the locking feature for

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,690
subversion we easily spent twice as much

00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,190
I'm designing the two parts of the

00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:06,010
locking feature than we did coding it

00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,680
because we there's a lot of discussion

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,180
to go went into what exactly it was and

00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,040
why it was there and what it would do

00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,540
that's always usually the harder part is

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,490
coming up with the design than the code

00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,950
yeah and it takes a lot of communication

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,630
and communication skills are key import

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,190
so the people who tend to complain a lot

00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,360
but not actually do anything are our

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,400
usual response to them

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,690
it's patches welcome that just which is

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,540
a common phrase you might hear in the

00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:32,110
open source world it's the open source

00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,090
way of saying go screw yourself well if

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,410
you don't like the person yeah so if

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,210
they come back with a patch that's great

00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,160
but usually they'll just either put up

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:43,150
or shut up and they will go away

00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,230
it depends okay if you're going to be

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,910
kind you would say hey could you write a

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,930
patch for that right and then if

00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,700
you're--if tied with it you'll say

00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:53,950
patches welcome in quote so that's

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:56,110
usually go away sign so yeah people are

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,370
so they're not thick-skinned you'll run

00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,900
into these people and these people are

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,640
never going to survive an open source in

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,850
general I don't know how to help them

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,460
other than to say learn to divorce

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,710
yourself from the argumentation it's

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,690
your opinion is valid but it's you know

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,940
not the only opinion out there and it's

00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,630
not all personal and those people tend

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,010
to not function well so tell you what

00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,080
disinfecting your community what happens

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,270
if somebody's already in your community

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,010
and you need to deal with this problem

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:28,929
they're disrupting your attention and

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:30,130
focus all right so assess the damage so

00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,020
the two questions you need to ask

00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:36,070
yourself is how are they affecting your

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,690
attention and focus at some point you

00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,130
start questioning and you say look you

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,020
know we've spent a lot of time arguing

00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,159
with this person they might be a member

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,840
of the community there might be a new

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,120
person to the community but at some

00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,919
point your hand wonder and say is this

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,240
going to terminate doesn't seem like

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,710
this process is going determine is it

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,720
going to help the project in the long

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,010
term and often you'll be sort of

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,720
surprised and say you know what this

00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,940
could go on forever and it's hard to

00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,380
step back and sometimes we need to kick

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,880
each other and say look you know you're

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,680
wasting your time talking to this person

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,640
you used to throw objects at me if I

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,290
spent too long talking to certain people

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,360
and the other question is you know are

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,330
they actually distracting the project

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,250
right now like

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,780
are you falling behind in the forward

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,500
momentum of your project because of this

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,970
one or two people these aren't questions

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,320
that you always ask yourself you know

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,580
usually you're so caught up in the

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,010
discussion you don't step back and

00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:31,020
notice but take a look at it it's um

00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:32,970
it's important then so don't think so

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,860
our first list of things is not to do as

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,970
part of your open-source project you

00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,490
don't want to feed the energy creature

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:41,100
somebody comes up and they're looking

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,080
for a fight and all you got to do is

00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,910
take a swing at them and it's on you

00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,440
know so the first thing you do is you

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,850
just ignore them if someone's obviously

00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,350
trolling you ignore them if they're

00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,600
trolling and have something valuable to

00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,790
say then you know it's great concentrate

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,840
on what they're saying that's valuable

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,690
ignore the other thing you don't want to

00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,950
give these jerks a gripping surface

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,770
basically because that's what they're

00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:04,430
looking for so don't engage them on that

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:07,560
don't get emotional stick to the facts

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:10,140
all right our first exam in the first

00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,340
example that I ran into we were very far

00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,990
along in subversion and somebody

00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,580
appeared on the list and basically gave

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:18,390
us a very long lecture about how our

00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,870
entire design and goals were completely

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,760
wrong

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,280
and we should start over and follow his

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,570
lead and and it wasn't done in a way

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,920
that you were like this is a crackpot I

00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,240
mean he actually had some real

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,560
argumentation going on in there was a

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,200
crackpot well it turned out to be a

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,790
crackpot later but we didn't know that

00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,900
but it looked like some very serious

00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,000
discussion questioning the whole

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,770
foundation of the project and this was

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,660
you know very far into the project so I

00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,190
and a couple other people I know got

00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,290
very emotional and started responding

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,140
you know extremely emotionally getting

00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:48,570
very into it disrupted I lost two or

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,860
three days of work you know just arguing

00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,160
with this person and it got really

00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,050
upsetting and ultimately all we could do

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,550
is in the end we just had to sort of

00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,230
walk away from the discussion because we

00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,730
knew we weren't going to budge no one

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,410
you did he was draining he lost the way

00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,590
as well he walked away as well that's

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:09,000
right so be careful don't don't let the

00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:14,730
emotional drain paralyze you good things

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,590
you should do good yeah good cop so pay

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,660
attention to newcomers sometimes people

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,240
come to lists and they look like trolls

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,650
and in fact if you look carefully it's

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,150
sometimes it's just a language barrier

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,590
maybe they're not speaking English as

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,730
their native language

00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,470
times there's just a little bit of

00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,240
miscommunication that's not going on and

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,710
you need to give them a benefit of a

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,210
doubt or at least for a few exchanges

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,930
before you really say well this person

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:39,540
is a troll because you'll find out that

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:42,630
sometimes well they'll actually have

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,340
useful things to tell you if it's a very

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:48,150
emotional email that comes into your

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,620
list or your IRC channel try to ignore

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,090
the emotion and say what is this person

00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,280
really getting at you know maybe they

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,660
found a bug but they're so upset you

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,580
know it's hard to see that their report

00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,960
really reporting a bug here or some new

00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,960
use case you haven't thought of already

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,550
so what is the example here of our

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,070
raving lunatic all right so so we had

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:10,860
everything that I could show up on our

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:13,140
list one day accusing us of not knowing

00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,450
how to write code of how could we

00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,980
possibly ship a product that has a bug

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,320
like this and we're just a bunch of

00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,480
complete losers shame on us and shame on

00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,530
you you know and this person was

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,600
actually pretty well known in the

00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,190
open-source community and some of us had

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,890
respect for this person up to this point

00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:31,560
some of us didn't but they actually had

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,590
a valid bug and I was so proud because I

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,670
came into this a day late and I the

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,990
first response is from another

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,580
subversion developer saying you know I

00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,230
think you're right on this bug here I

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,210
think this is where it's going like this

00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,800
and you know I think we can address this

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,420
by this I've opened an issue and we're

00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,860
going to track this and the person came

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,880
back with more vitriol well you

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,050
shouldn't have shipped this in the first

00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,050
place and how could you possibly have

00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:54,660
not seen as you losers all bile in all

00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,070
commerce in and I did this and this

00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,930
happened and then the person other

00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,130
person responded okay so this happened

00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,230
that what it looks like happening is

00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,990
it's a mismatch with this version bla

00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:06,210
bla bla completely calm and I've written

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,530
a patch for it and I'm going to review

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,510
it and see if this is it and then the

00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,430
person came back with more stupidity and

00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,780
but yeah but what was great here was so

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,170
great to watch this in action you know

00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,330
one half of the conversation just

00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,740
outlandish insane emotional anger and

00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,080
then all the responses from our

00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,850
community just being extremely calm and

00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,530
quiet and rational and ignoring

00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,750
everything it was fantastic and the guy

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,340
went away it had no effect on us so we

00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,470
got a motor fix - yeah we got a bug

00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,660
report we get it fixed and but he ended

00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,800
up looking like the like the idiot

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:41,540
really

00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:44,180
yeah yeah but he had a real bug so yeah

00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,490
sometimes you do have to ignore I mean

00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,610
it he won't always be able to extract a

00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,840
bug report from the person or and what

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:55,640
I'm trying to write which example was

00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,840
this 31.0 was this the uh rewrite no

00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,070
yeah I think it was the rewrite yeah

00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,150
this was the same rewrite it was the

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,320
same it wasn't another one of the same

00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,850
guys the one who said we should start

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,380
over from scratch and follow his design

00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,380
you ignored him and yet was ignoring him

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,010
and then sometimes they can be so awful

00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,930
you you you have to forcibly boot them

00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,390
from the community there was one person

00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:16,160
who came to our mailing list who seemed

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,900
sort of like an eager student he was

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,970
very excited to participate in the

00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,890
subversion project and he wanted to help

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,180
out and he had all these ideas and he

00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,050
said I won't tell me which documents to

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,030
read he started reading all the

00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:29,090
documents and then the strange thing

00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:31,460
happened every hour he started posting

00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:33,140
questions to the development mailing

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,850
list well how do I do this and have you

00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,680
thought about this symbol and they were

00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,410
all sort of well-intentioned questions

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,120
but and and he obviously had a respect

00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,010
for us but I don't think he realized

00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,990
that he was draining our attention

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,850
because he wanted essentially someone to

00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,130
hold his hand and sort of walk him

00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,890
through it and you know be a tutor and

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,300
nobody we were actually fell into it for

00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,470
awhile we started saying oh look here

00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,300
look here we were trying to be very very

00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,030
nice because he was being so nice as

00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,610
well and I think it was Fitz who noticed

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,230
maybe a couple weeks later maybe maybe

00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,940
just a week later either I was I was I

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,890
was on a month a full month what did you

00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,150
do what happened it was a full month

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,860
later I'm like you know god this guy's

00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,990
just showing up all over the place so I

00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,580
wrote a little program that went through

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,680
my mail spool for the last month and

00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,690
picked out the top five posters and four

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,250
of those posters were committers and one

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,990
of those posters was this person and he

00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,930
was the number two poster to our mailing

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:25,280
list and then I did a little further

00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,930
investigation and over half of the

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,500
committee's posters were follow-ups to

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:32,300
this guy yeah so I I did a little bit of

00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,280
politicking year and just because I

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,050
wanted to be sensitive and and see what

00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,220
other people thought I said sent this

00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,680
little these statistics out because

00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,270
nothing beats hard data I said these

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,680
little statistics out to some other

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,960
committees I said look you know this

00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,460
case really took a lot of time I think

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,020
that we should actually gently ask in

00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,210
leave what do you think about this in my

00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,040
off base and they took look at the

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,450
numbers and they're like oh yeah I think

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,510
I think it's time to take drastic

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,580
measures and karl karl fogel being like

00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,920
the nicest person in the universe very

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,240
diplomatic very diplomatic spent like an

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,090
hour with this guy on the phone gently

00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,650
asking him to you know just not stop

00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,380
posting our mailing list and the guy

00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,910
still didn't understand it it was sad I

00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,770
mean he but he ended up leaving but he

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,970
didn't understand no matter how much we

00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,490
explained he didn't understand he was

00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,080
draining our attention yeah and keep

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,100
that what was the hardest one to do and

00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,120
that's probably that's I think that's

00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,730
the only person we've ever actually

00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,710
asked directly asked well we did revoke

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:29,160
commit access once an early early has

00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,480
but it was a long time ago say so

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,250
repeal trolls with niceness this is

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,890
another case sort of similar to the IRC

00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,450
situation we described where some of the

00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,980
email situation but this was an IRC

00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,840
somebody just came into our IRC channel

00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,730
where the developers hang out and I

00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,170
think we said well I think this is

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,550
ridiculous I started using subversion

00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,080
because I was forced to use it and I

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,610
think it's awful and this is terrible

00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,990
and what's wrong with this build and be

00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,190
yeah we could have built was it no

00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,660
that's right he doesn't go and be a

00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,410
Caesar I can't build I can't build this

00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,420
isn't working

00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,430
what's wrong with you guys and we know

00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,080
the response of course was very very

00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,660
helpful quiet oh well have you tried

00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,890
this have you tried this and he's trying

00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,420
to get a rise out of us it becomes

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,190
obvious after a little while that he's

00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,160
trying to say things to just get us

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,020
angry and we're just completely ignoring

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,570
him and finally the last thing he says

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,220
was the quote you guys aren't gonna be

00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:19,530
like fight I'm out of here I came here

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:22,170
to argue and really bizarre looking down

00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:26,010
oh yeah what just happened but it

00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:30,920
happened so what's our uh this is

00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:33,000
summing it all up so remember to

00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,470
preserve your attention and focus that's

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,790
what you are guarding that is the

00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,130
long-term health of the project in the

00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:39,420
community then you need to fortify your

00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,550
community by having good community

00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,950
practices pretty obvious we talked about

00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,320
all those then you need to be on lookout

00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,360
for people coming in and then if people

00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,730
do get in don't be afraid to boot them

00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,630
out or to stick up for your culture no

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,320
matter what the cost

00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:58,010
um you need to be confident in that and

00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,300
that pretty much sums it up however fits

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,140
well actually have a little bit of a

00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,730
secret to tell

00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:08,010
after all this we're talking about open

00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:10,049
source and next slide my next slide so

00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:13,440
this doesn't actually just apply to open

00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:15,930
source communities this applies to any

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,640
community this applies to communities at

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,890
work that supplies to social communities

00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,599
the church group your church group your

00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,819
knitting circle whatever the case might

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,010
be and you know it's so it's sort of

00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:27,660
like we we gave this talk earlier this

00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,940
year to the Summer of Code mentors

00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,940
summit where all that some google Summer

00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,430
of Code mentors came in and it was like

00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,140
this huge group therapy hoedown because

00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,490
we're like and then we had this jerk

00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,289
that did this and like 10 people know

00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,029
night circle I know that guy you're

00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:44,190
talking about we had him show up at our

00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:47,940
community and do the same thing but we

00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,650
had someone like that you know so the

00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,359
sort of thing that applies to me and you

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,150
can look for these these kind of

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,460
people's in your everyday work or

00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:58,980
anywhere yeah absolutely so I think

00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,510
that's it for our slides but we do have

00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,069
time for questions and answers if people

00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:04,109
want to talk about you have answers we'd

00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:05,759
love to hear them yeah I'll answer any

00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:07,559
googles in the audience to keep things

00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:11,099
non-google specific since this is an

00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:14,369
open-source talk to the public yeah all

00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:18,019
right there is that mic on back there No

00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:18,019
okay we'll repeat your question

00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:37,990
I imagine that the archives are huge so

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,490
so the question is is you know how do

00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,750
you tip how do you tell someone to read

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:57,670
the archives when the archives are

00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:59,170
gigantic and yeah well there's well so

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,369
how do you read yeah when someone needs

00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,480
to learn something but you know how do

00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:03,250
you tell them to be the archives your

00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,990
archives are so big the first thing is

00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,910
is that if you're going to point them to

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,010
a specific conversation give them a link

00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,869
directly to that conversation the second

00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,210
part of that is is that you have to

00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:15,309
continue document in Lluis lead occupant

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,900
your project from day one to the present

00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,520
day and so if there's something

00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,000
important that happens like I said a

00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,290
design decision a mistake or some

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,790
something has changed in your community

00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:27,579
you need to document that the subversion

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:29,020
hacking document as it's called started

00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:30,400
off is about I don't know three pages

00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,770
long but was about how to contribute

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,079
some patches like 70 pages long I mean

00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:37,720
it's an HTML document that goes from

00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,099
here to New York and it's pretty it's

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,599
pretty big

00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:42,190
but it describes a lot of things that

00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,780
describes a lot of how to participate in

00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,540
the community how to contribute patches

00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:49,750
what we expect the patches to look like

00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:51,730
how to participate in email conversation

00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,380
etiquette right I mean and we also in

00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,030
talks about a release procedure - yeah

00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,619
tell me - about all that but we've also

00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,799
got various design Doc's sprinkled

00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:02,049
throughout our codes very is a commented

00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:04,390
in great detail and not to take too much

00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:05,950
cred but Ben and I are two of the three

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,710
authors of the main subversion book

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,390
which is free to me it's the main

00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,829
project documentation you can purchase a

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,589
tree we're version of it but it's free

00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:16,510
and it's very detailed and Ben started

00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:18,369
it actually and that is it one of the

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:21,760
things that helped us a lot not only to

00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:23,109
avoid repeating questions but to gaining

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,339
market share in the first place because

00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:26,049
people would come and say oh there's be

00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:28,869
a software if it was just awesome Docs

00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:30,099
if you're well documented then 99% of

00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,319
the time when somebody asks for help

00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:34,030
there will be a really relevant link you

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,260
can give to them and if that's not the

00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:38,609
case then you know what needs to be

00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,609
written right so

00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,560
which one's going to be a detriment

00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:49,780
but what you mean you mean the you're

00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,040
saying of the four things will sit on

00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,720
the slides which one is going to be the

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:58,660
detriment of riser FS I'm not really

00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:02,800
give me this or the you know the respect

00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:07,150
humility not respect humility no no what

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,250
oh oh right no that guy so there's a

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,830
poisonous person no that's good

00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,940
I know he's talking about yeah he had

00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,940
lack of respect for people

00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:24,860
what about project management

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:29,490
so the question was what do you think

00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,560
about having a project manager who just

00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:34,760
sort of manages the community and

00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,560
doesn't do any code and interestingly I

00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,180
worked in my last job basically five

00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,830
years being paid to work on subversion

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,960
and it started out almost entirely

00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,090
coding and by the time I got to the last

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,470
couple years I was spending about sixty

00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,849
percent of my time doing community

00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:50,090
management forty percent of my time

00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:52,710
coding and that's just what it took to

00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,720
keep the project healthy and functioning

00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,160
so you'll find you I've never heard of a

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,750
project that actually has explicit

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,849
community managers but what you'll find

00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,800
is in healthy projects maybe open up we

00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:03,720
hear Open Office does but it's rather

00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,800
unusual usually will happen is certain

00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,930
members of the community who are also

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,330
very good coders will sort of fall into

00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:12,150
the role of also being police and in

00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,680
preservers of culture and tone and karl

00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,900
fogel is especially good at that right

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,700
and non coders typically wind up doing

00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,220
things to sort of serve the needs of the

00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,500
project as a whole as opposed to setting

00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,940
direction open-source projects are

00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,580
notoriously bottoms-up

00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:29,099
and direction is set by the people

00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,599
writing the code and I think that's one

00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:34,170
of the things that I find very appealing

00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:36,630
about open-source you need to have a lot

00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:40,500
of respect and credit already to be

00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:42,390
culture police so I don't think it's the

00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,570
simple case of saying hey you over here

00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:46,440
why don't you monitor our our lists that

00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,369
person needs to be a pretty

00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,200
well-respected member of the community

00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:50,460
already and if they decide to do that on

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,990
their own that's great but it's

00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,430
different than sort of saying hey why

00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,690
don't you over there manage our patches

00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,010
and make sure we don't ignore any

00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,080
patches that come through which is a

00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,710
very technical job and you don't need a

00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:07,430
lot of respect for that sure any other

00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:07,430
questions damp tea

00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:11,109
look at jobs

00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,730
this is significant

00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,339
so the question is how do you see how

00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:25,769
open source communities function I guess

00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:29,039
versus a closed source within

00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:31,680
corporations right don't you I think it

00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,569
depends vastly on the company you know

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,640
Google is a very bottom-up company and I

00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:37,440
think I I think it works a lot like

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,920
open-source communities do which is

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,289
unusual which is extremely unusual so I

00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,019
think a lot of it depends on on the

00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:48,059
company culture and the founders and a

00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:49,920
whole lot of other different things

00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,960
I think I'm from listen what I've seen

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,229
on many corporations are very much the

00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,729
opposite they're very tops down nobody

00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:59,609
knows what anyone else is working on all

00:50:56,729 --> 00:51:00,660
the not necessarily you have decisions

00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:03,329
being made at the highest level and they

00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,009
trickle down and there isn't really a

00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:06,690
sense of community in the same way that

00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:08,039
you see in an open-source community and

00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,930
so as a result a lot of these

00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:11,609
dysfunctions will sort of creep in

00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:13,950
you'll see people establishing fiefdom

00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:15,839
Shover certain areas of code you'll see

00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,999
people fighting with each other sort of

00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,739
maybe in a passive aggressive way when

00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:21,509
they should be collaborating so it you

00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:26,130
know that's something that corporations

00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:30,979
need to watch out for culture of trust

00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,979
is hard to get to yes

00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,530
so the question is how much do you need

00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:44,740
to meet in person to have deep design

00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:47,950
discussions and general discussions

00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,390
about your project you don't really need

00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,070
to meet at all but it's going to be some

00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,450
it's going to take a lot more time if

00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,660
you don't meet at all it's a question of

00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:57,640
bandwidth I think right I mean email is

00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,010
pretty low bandwidth IRC is better

00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,470
bandwidth telephones even better being

00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,700
face to face is best yet and I think

00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,050
what a common pattern you'll see is a

00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,550
lot of open source projects start out

00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:09,099
with maybe just two or three people in

00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:10,540
the same room coming up with a design

00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:12,580
and a set of goals and a mission and

00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,710
whatnot then they go off to the internet

00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:17,680
and once that ball gets rolling it's

00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:19,240
easier to add people in because the

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,830
bandwidth it needed isn't as high

00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,140
anymore a lot of designs issues have

00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:24,520
already been made but that's common this

00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,290
common developers didn't have a

00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,990
face-to-face meeting until last year

00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:31,420
that was the first like some element of

00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,310
all the developers we had you know the

00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,369
collabnet employees that with the four

00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:38,140
of us shared an office in Chicago and

00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:40,900
you know we did discussions offline and

00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,520
whatnot but we always brought our made

00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,260
decisions offline decisions were always

00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,820
made in the mailing list because it's

00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,520
not fair to developers in different time

00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,960
zones in in different places that sort

00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,099
of thing that is that it's a cult that's

00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,510
one of the things one of the rules or at

00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:53,950
least of our of our community is that

00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:56,800
you can talk all you want

00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:58,359
face to face or an IRC but it's not an

00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,619
official discussion until it happens on

00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,670
the mailing list because we want to

00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:02,380
include everybody and that's where

00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,420
decisions were always made so we would

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,880
have these meetings at face to face in

00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,920
our office and then usually Ben or Karl

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,210
would do this long right up to the list

00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,770
of what we discussed and then the

00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:13,869
discussion would start in earnest there

00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:16,859
and then decisions will be made there

00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:19,480
with the rest of our committers present

00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:21,369
because and the one thing now I didn't

00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,920
work for CollabNet until four years in

00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:25,510
2004 even though I was a committer since

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,730
almost since the beginning of subversion

00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:30,609
and one of the things that they did

00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:32,170
right was that they submit they've had

00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:33,580
four people they paid full times four

00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,650
plus people they played full time to

00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:38,080
work on subversion but these people

00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:40,810
never had a magical trump card that said

00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,000
you know we're going to do this it was

00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:44,619
always a consensus based consensus

00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,910
driven development and that certainly

00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:47,380
came up with some they came up with

00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,030
different things and you guys would have

00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,220
gone with yeah

00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,210
where there was the consensus of the

00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,710
committee was more important than the

00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,790
fact that the corporation happened to be

00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,410
paying people to work on it which is

00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:58,140
it's a hard tension to balance

00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:00,780
I remember we hired somebody to a fifth

00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:03,330
person to work on we hired Mike pelota

00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,620
to work to work for our company hired

00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,870
him to work on subversion just like the

00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,950
rest of us and you know his first days I

00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,020
mean what do you mean I can't submit

00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,970
code you know well like well you have to

00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,680
you know the work community has to vote

00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,150
you in you have to prove that you know

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,220
what's going on and he was sort of

00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:19,200
stunned since he was being paid to work

00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,400
on this he had the early dissent packet

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,380
and he had to get just like anyone else

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,650
he had to earn trust from everyone you

00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:30,090
know his employer was irrelevant yeah

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:33,360
with other questions Oh another question

00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:35,070
let me do one more no I guess not well

00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,210
thank you all for coming it was really

00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,840
great to talk to you we'll be here for a

00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,840
