so this is a this is an installment of

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:37,150
the open source software series speaker

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,890
a lot of asses their speaker series I'm

00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,750
Mike Pinkerton I'm a software engineer

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,540
at Google and I'm going to be talking

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,790
about a variety of things especially

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,770
encompassing the the lessons that we

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,350
learned from Mozilla and specifically

00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,870
convenience it's sort of one of the

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,230
first questions you know what do I have

00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,540
to say why why come listen to anything

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,040
that I have to say I've done quite a bit

00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,489
in the open source community in the last

00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,170
six or seven or eight years I was an

00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,500
engineer at Netscape for about five

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,360
years I was on the team that opened the

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,670
source open the netscape communicator

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,950
source to the public as part of the

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,440
Mozilla project I was on the team that

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,540
designed zool dar cross-platform user

00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,430
interface language which is what Firefox

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,070
is built in so I was I was on that

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,470
original engineering team i'm also a

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,590
super reviewer as part of mozilla which

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,200
means that i have for secondary level of

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,600
review over all the code that gets

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,700
checked in so i can i can say yay or nay

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,190
on pretty much anything that goes in the

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,679
entire mozilla source base i'm also the

00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,690
project lead of a little mac browser

00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:45,459
called the called Kamino which is

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,310
probably the main reason why you're here

00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,399
but what we're going to what we're

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,470
really going to be talking about is not

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,979
necessarily so much Camino we there is

00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,929
going to be a good amount of Kamino talk

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,220
but what I also want to highlight is a

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:03,190
lot of the lessons that we've learned

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,929
through the entire process so starting

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,289
with opening up the source from Mozilla

00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:10,929
and how that caused us to need to do

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,860
Camino and what lessons we then learn

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,870
from from interacting with the community

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,459
moving forward but to really understand

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,730
all that to understand why we are where

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:23,830
we are today we have to understand how

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,660
all of this got started you know why is

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,849
there a camino why is there a Firefox

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,890
why is there even a Mozilla so we need

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,890
to go back to nineteen ninety-eight

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,890
so if everyone sort of joins me in our

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,640
way back machine back to nineteen

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,890
ninety-eight there was really only two

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,560
browsers at the time there was Netscape

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,360
communicator and microsoft internet

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,090
explorer IE for had just was either just

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,430
coming out or had already come out i

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,799
don't remember exactly and they were

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,470
starting to to rapidly gained market

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,079
share by undercutting netscape's

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,790
business model which was at the time

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,730
selling communicator for thirty or forty

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,950
dollars through retail channels and

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,319
giving away you know giving away to to

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,629
academics so the the business model for

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,970
the company as a whole was selling this

00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,769
product and microsoft was giving it away

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,739
for free so there's you know there's an

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,840
obvious consumer choice do i do i pay or

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,840
do i download for free it's usually

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,209
pretty obvious so netscape was watching

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,099
its its market share dwindle and we

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,410
realized we had to change the rules

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,000
there was really nothing else that we

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,989
could do in terms of competing directly

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,790
with microsoft because they had vastly

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,579
greater resources they had vastly

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,680
greater monetary resources and also

00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,950
engineering you know microsoft was in a

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,959
position where they wanted that they had

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,139
a target on that scape and they would do

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,109
and spend any amount of money in order

00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,209
to to realize that goal so they very

00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,459
easily could have put 500 engineers on

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,489
on internet explorer and just out

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,079
engineer us and just do a lot more than

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,019
we could possibly do as a small company

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,940
in netscape was a big deal but even in

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:14,169
1998 it was still a relatively small

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:17,669
company by by today's standards so we

00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:20,109
realized we had to change the rules as

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,240
internet explorer was was slowly

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:27,130
becoming more and more a part of the

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:31,090
operating system with with 98 we knew

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,400
that there was that microsoft was was

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,539
going down a path of no return the more

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,669
that they were building into the

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:39,340
operating system meant that they

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,169
couldn't easily pull it out later so we

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,810
wanted to go somewhere that we knew they

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,560
couldn't go and that one of one of those

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,290
places was open source

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,570
we could open source our browser we

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,450
could open source all of the all of the

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,520
technologies involved and Microsoft

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,580
couldn't follow us because to do that

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,720
they've locked themselves into the

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,730
operating system and they certainly

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,850
weren't going to go into open source

00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,740
windows 98 so this was certainly one one

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,200
area that we could go where we knew we

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,730
had a few steps on them before that they

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,590
could they could switch everything and

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,380
catch up the other thing that we wanted

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,290
to harness was this this great community

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,080
of hackers and developers in the open

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,840
source that would come to our rescue

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,840
they come flocking to help netscape

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,020
defeat Microsoft and having the code

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,940
available to them would allow them to

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,430
you know to help us fix bugs to help us

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,919
add features to help us make the product

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,750
a lot better and again Microsoft

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,340
wouldn't be able to leverage the same

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,120
resources because they wouldn't be able

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,950
to open source so we were looking at

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,380
this great hacker community and we were

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,690
looking at the the general anti

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,840
Microsoft sediment which there there is

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,520
still a lot of today and we wanted to

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,430
capture and harness that so we created

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,130
this project called source 331 and the

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,979
source 331 project was to take the

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:07,210
Netscape communicator source code which

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:09,979
was then just down to the browser for

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,690
logistical purposes and released that on

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,560
March thirty first nineteen ninety-eight

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,030
that's where the 331 comes from so i can

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,100
i can probably stand up here and talk

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:24,440
for about six hours just about that

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,820
specific project thankfully a during the

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,039
time that we were doing that there was a

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,229
documentary film crew who's following us

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,460
around the company they sort of started

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,690
a little bit before and then they

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,350
finished up about six to eight months

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,470
later but they made a PBS documentary

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,880
called code rush which you can go and go

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,320
to your local library and rent or I

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,060
think you can still buy it off PBS's

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,310
website so if you're if you're

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,889
interested about that period of time

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,050
with taking taking the the closed source

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,120
communicator and moving that into the

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,340
Mozilla world that's an excellent video

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,660
to watch and it's it's still interesting

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:03,270
to this day even even for

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:06,330
very engineering centric crowd what I

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,390
what I will say is that it it was a lot

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,160
of fun it was one of the one of the most

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,930
interesting projects I've ever been on

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,460
in terms of the group coming together

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,680
realizing this is we have to hit this

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,750
date we have to get this out we have to

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,940
do this for the community you know it

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,180
became more than just us doing something

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,520
to ship a product because it was it was

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,020
the birth of Mozilla it was you know day

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,210
one of Mozilla March thirty first

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,500
nineteen ninety-eight and we knew that

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,780
there was something bigger out there

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,220
that we were opening the door to

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,380
something that they could eventually

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,840
become really really great and also

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,410
helped Netscape kill Microsoft or at

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,860
least get them off our back a little bit

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,840
so we wouldn't we did that and

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,910
everything was a success 331 came and

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,600
win and we shipped on time great press

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,970
all of that and then we kind of had to

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,380
go back to work so what we were doing

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,530
during the time was we were working on

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,480
Netscape 5 and since we had just now

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,550
opened up the source for what was going

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,040
to be Netscape 5 all of the people in

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,410
engineering had to wear two hats we had

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,210
to wear our open source hat where we

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,919
wanted to do everything in public we

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,350
wanted to involve the community in every

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,140
decision we wanted to be upfront and

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,480
honest and you know not not hide

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,120
anything from our users from our

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,770
developers you know design documents

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,750
were in that we're in the open bug

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,969
system was in the open all of our

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,310
process was out there and we wanted to

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,960
really live in a fishbowl so that

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,110
everybody could see every part of our

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,090
process so as engineers we're adding new

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,219
features to the product we're fixing

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,410
bugs we're taking some patches from the

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,950
community like hey you know this this is

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,180
actually sort of working and and we

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,240
start making some pretty good progress

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,340
so we're we're probably a few months

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,110
from from beta of netscape 5 and

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,930
management comes to us and they say

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:04,590
we've got this other rendering engine

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,360
that we think that we think is really

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,810
good it's really fast it's really small

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,580
it does all of these w3c standards XML

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,040
HTML CSS download

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,760
whatever you know just all the HTML but

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,440
all the w3c buzzwords and you know we'd

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,720
like to investigate using this for

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,220
netscape 5 because you know one area

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,100
where microsoft was really starting to

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,930
kill us was web standards and

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,750
compatibility because they had a lot

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,000
more engineers than we did so we took a

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,950
look at doing something drastic like

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,140
switching layout engines so the

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,290
engineering groups stopped what we were

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,400
doing on netscape 5 and took about two

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,240
or three weeks to do a little bit of you

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,790
know just a little bit of sanity

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,710
checking we looked through the code we

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,270
tried to plot out a schedule for what it

00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,640
would take to actually switch over the

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,970
product to use this new engine so the

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,280
the engine at the time was a grad

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,200
student project gone horribly wrong it

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,090
was very difficult to extend it was very

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,250
difficult to fix it was probably meant

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,130
to last no later than Netscape 1 and

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,990
here we are in netscape 5 so the fact of

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,980
moving to a cleaner codebase moving to

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,260
something that had been better

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,780
architected was something that everybody

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,760
wanted and that that project that new

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,170
other browser or that new other

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,540
rendering engine was called the Raptor

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,220
project and it was done by a group down

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,710
in San Diego from a company that we

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,350
purchased and had been rewritten it

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,390
started in Java or sardine C++ and was

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,390
rewritten in Java than it was ported by

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,260
back to C++ so they done a lot of

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,850
architecture and engineering and

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,070
thinking about it was a lot cleaner than

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,530
the spaghetti mess that we had Sarah was

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,810
really excited about it we took a lot we

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,250
we did a lot of research on it we said

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,140
you know you know this is just going to

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,760
take too long we figure it's going to

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,440
take a few months we're so close to

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,240
shipping beta let's just get beta out

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,760
there and then we'll go and we'll do it

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,580
so management said alright sounds good

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
thank you very much go back you know go

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,980
back on your merry way and so we kept

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,230
working on that scape five so me on the

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,150
Mac front-end team and Dave Hyatt who is

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,370
on the windows front-end team we were

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,530
just we just kept working you know all

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,970
the all the engineering teams just kept

00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,790
moving along towards with a singular

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,190
focus of Netscape five then about eight

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,630
weeks later management came to us and

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,140
they got us all in a room they SAT us

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,520
down and they said you know that Raptor

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,780
project thing that we asked you about

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,270
the he said we didn't have time

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,400
to do what we're going to do it and your

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,310
projects dead so equity mean your

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,990
projects dead well what what we've been

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,970
working towards Nets k 5 which we'd

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,460
called grommet which was our code name

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,320
for for that project they came to us and

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,090
they said grommets dead we're not going

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,980
to do that we're going to completely

00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,570
shift gears and we're going to base

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,370
everything off of this new rendering

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,950
engine okay great you know no engineer

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,350
likes to be told that all of their work

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:58,620
is just down the toilet but especially

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,480
no engineer likes to be told that you

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,130
know the last eight weeks when

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,870
management knew that are going to make

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,470
this decision anyway you know why didn't

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,930
they tell us eight weeks ago but it's

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,880
one thing for just us engineers just us

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,980
in the building at Netscape okay

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,630
management made a decision great big

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,520
deal you know management they change

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,290
their mind all the time they make these

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,140
crazy decisions that's why they're not

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,600
writing code but it's more than just us

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,580
at this point it's also the open source

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,320
community you know the engineers we've

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,840
been wearing our open source hats and

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,510
we'd been playing by the rules we've

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,130
been sharing everything that we that we

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,480
knew and everything we wanted to do and

00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,550
everything we'd been doing with this

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,310
community this growing burgeoning

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,550
community and suddenly management came

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,900
and with a closed door decision said

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,730
we're not going to do any more of that

00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,460
we're going to do this other thing and

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,590
they didn't bother to tell anybody in

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,840
the community they didn't let on they

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,450
didn't make any notion or you know any

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,600
any type of communication to the open

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,060
source community and so what what Dave

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,000
Hyatt did was he went into the bug

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,930
system and he took all two hundred and

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,730
something of his bugs at one time

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,940
checked them all and mark them as won't

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,940
fix and the comment was grommet is dead

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,130
or doing something else and that is how

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,620
the open source community found out that

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,710
we were doing this new thing which is

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,690
just just astounding that that would be

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,210
the only communication for this major

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,570
project to make a major change in

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,810
direction and the only communication was

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,819
a developer marking all their bugs won't

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,929
fix and so needless to say

00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,239
the open source community was pretty

00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:45,299
angry with us we lost a lot of Street

00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:48,509
credit on that day there probably wasn't

00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:50,879
much of a better way to do it I mean

00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,829
there's given where we were given the

00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,419
decision had already been made there

00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,579
really weren't any good ways to tell the

00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,309
community but this certainly wasn't the

00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:01,439
right way and a lot of developers just

00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:03,029
fled because they you know they said if

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,379
this is how you're going to work with

00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,629
the open source community we don't want

00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,239
anything to do with you and we lost a

00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:11,910
tremendous amount of Street credit so

00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:14,789
where were we well we no longer have

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,069
grommet sin you know now we're starting

00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:18,899
from scratch and we no longer have a

00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:22,559
huge chunk of our open source community

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,359
all right well the next sort of shoe to

00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,850
drop was that management came to us and

00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:30,389
they said you know before where we had

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,859
multiple multiple platform teams we had

00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,559
a Windows team and a Mac team and a

00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:36,839
Linux team we don't have the money to do

00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,399
that anymore so you guys can either

00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,470
figure out how to do it in one team

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,169
where we're going to do it for windows

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,059
only and the engineers kind of looked at

00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,189
her we looked at each other and Netscape

00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,959
had it at the time had a very rich

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,729
history of being cross platform

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,549
basically from day one it was

00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:55,199
cross-platform and we were very proud of

00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:57,479
the fact that we were able to ship on 20

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,569
platforms at the same time with every

00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:02,639
single release and so it was ingrained

00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,470
in our culture to not just ship for

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,519
windows certainly it was a priority at

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,829
the company because that's where all the

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,439
money was but in the engineering

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:13,049
community it was hard grained into us to

00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:15,329
be cross-platform so what we did was we

00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:18,169
we came up we took a step back and we

00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:20,100
came up with a new plan we realized that

00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:22,229
you know if we were going to do this

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,999
cross platform that we needed we needed

00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:25,379
something new we looked around at all

00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,970
the cross-platform toolkits and there

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,609
really wasn't anything that was

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,179
worthwhile but we also made the

00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:34,919
realization that there's sort of two

00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:38,209
camps when it comes to designing

00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:42,449
software there's the people that that

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:45,600
have the experience doing design and HCI

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:47,519
and you know all of the all of the good

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,319
user interface background like that's

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,620
what they've gone to school for they

00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:55,350
know certain certain technologies like J

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,840
believe they know web standards they

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,840
know HTML because they've been doing web

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,820
layout web design you know they're

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,020
they're good at Photoshop they can

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,510
probably right a little bit of

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,800
JavaScript so you know that's that's

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,050
sort of one camp those are the people

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,270
that that know how to design software

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,940
for users and then there's the other

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,980
camp which is the programmers the people

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,920
that actually take what the designers

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,360
say and implement it and the programmers

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,390
well they can't design to save their

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,940
lives and all they know is this magical

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:30,750
language that converts you know English

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,460
text to bits and bytes C++ or you know

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,790
whatever programming language the

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,410
designers don't know C++ and the people

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,420
that know C++ don't know how to do

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,030
design and so there's this huge mismatch

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,210
between what the designers hand over and

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,890
what the programmers end up implementing

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,840
it also really takes the designers out

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,030
of the process because you know they

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,580
they're just sort of handing things over

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,260
the wall and then magic happens magic

00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,600
that nobody understands unless you have

00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,030
a CS degree and you know 15 years of

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,340
school behind you to to make something

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,350
actually show up on the screen so that

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,800
you taking the two camps in and they

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,930
were very separated so we wanted to we

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,720
wanted to reduce that gap we wanted to

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,640
to take the abilities that these

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,520
designers had the very strong you I

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,830
skills and make it easy for them to make

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,400
you eyes themselves so how do we do that

00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:25,290
well we give them tools that use the the

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,180
languages and the the skills that they

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:33,180
already have HTML Dom javascript CSS XML

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,700
and that's how zool came about so we

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,670
were able to make a cross-platform you I

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,980
language that allowed designers to

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,750
actually put bits on the screen that you

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,680
could interact with so now you no longer

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,930
had to go to UI design or UI tests and

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,790
show people pieces of paper and move

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,590
little scraps of paper around they could

00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,600
actually make real you is that did

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,030
things and they didn't have to have ten

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,600
years of schooling to do it so it really

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:03,570
sort of changed change the world but of

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,250
course we had to build all of this you

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,269
know it's a great idea but now someone's

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,749
actually got a code

00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:13,409
so in addition to building with a new

00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:18,209
layout engine we were building on top of

00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:20,099
that a UI layer which you know writing

00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:22,049
from scratch and on top of that our

00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,700
marketing department told us that this

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,649
new version of Netscape had to have

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,169
every single feature of the old version

00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:30,869
of Netscape plus more because who wants

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,089
to download just the same old thing so

00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:35,309
we were making an exact copy of Netscape

00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:37,799
communicator and adding more features

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,299
while we were at it on top of a UI layer

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:44,159
that was being written from scratch on

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:48,450
top of a rendering engine that barely

00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:51,389
laid out the top 100 pages if that so

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:56,249
needless to say we had a lot of work

00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:58,679
ahead of us and we certainly had we

00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:00,419
certainly had some difficulties so after

00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,639
a few years of going through this pain

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:05,459
you know trying to involve the open

00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:06,809
source community at every turn but we

00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:09,570
didn't really get a lot of involvement

00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:13,589
because we sort of told them to go away

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,359
earlier we get to the point where we

00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:17,779
have to make a call and we have to ship

00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,669
something for the fear of completely

00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,739
becoming obsolete you know nobody would

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,200
remember who Netscape was unless we

00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,489
actually ship something to users so what

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,219
we ended up doing is we just took the

00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:31,139
whole ball we called it netscape 6 and

00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:35,940
we shipped it and that was in I think

00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:41,369
2000 and it was crap it was absolute

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,229
total unadulterated crap I feel I feel

00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:44,789
terrible that my name is connected

00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:46,709
somehow with that software project

00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:49,679
because it was just something that I

00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:51,539
wouldn't even tell my friends to use you

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,639
know it's not something that was really

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,679
fit for human consumption it was just we

00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:59,909
have to get this out or we'll face being

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,829
obsolete so certainly you know we we

00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:04,169
took our pounds in the press because

00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:05,459
we'd spent two or more years I mean it'd

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,440
been almost three years since I stayed

00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:09,329
for had shipped and here we ship this

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,149
brand new thing on this great new

00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:16,079
rendering engine and nobody wants to use

00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:17,700
it for good reason so we went back to

00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,610
the drawing board and we

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,889
we were actually able to spend the time

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,480
that we needed to do some improvements

00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,860
we were able to improve performance we

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
were able to improve memory consumption

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,460
we were able to spend the time to do a

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,919
lot of the polish that we didn't have

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,039
time for the first go around so that was

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,320
Netscape 6.1 and you know it sort of

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,049
sucked a little less you know it was

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,230
something that we could almost use on a

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:45,990
daily basis and then 6.2 came out and

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,590
you know it was actually usable it was

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,019
actually pretty good you know from from

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:54,120
the history of you know starting over

00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,130
from scratch and the whole debacle of

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,350
Netscape 6 by the time it got to 62

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,669
people could actually use it and it was

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,870
actually something that you'd want to

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,690
tell your friends that you worked on

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,279
then went to Netscape 7 was the next

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,169
major release and people to this day

00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,840
still use Netscape 7 as their browser

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,460
you know given given all the badness in

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:19,440
its history it actually turned out

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:22,080
pretty good so where am I okay the

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,570
problem that we face though especially

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,120
on the mac side is that we were

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,590
constrained by a lot of the

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,980
infrastructure decisions that were made

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,659
long long ago on the Raptor side and

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,919
wrapped her then became gecko which

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:39,779
you've probably all heard of gecko a lot

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,529
of the decisions in the infrastructure

00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:45,090
of gecko were very window centric it was

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,250
designed for windows it was built for

00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,690
windows the fact that it could be ported

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,059
to other operating systems was an

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,070
afterthought and we actually had to go

00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:56,279
and do that after we'd already decided

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:59,100
that we were going to use this and so

00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,480
through through that and into zool we

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,830
were constrained by a lot of the things

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,200
we were able to do we weren't really

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,940
able to make it as native feeling or

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,269
even as native looking as we wanted

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,789
because a lot of those very low level

00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:15,600
constraints and a bunch of us started

00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:17,639
thinking you know should we spend ten

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,100
years putting all of this effort into

00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:24,059
making zool better or should we try

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,649
something else should we try and you

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:29,129
know should we go in a different

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,779
direction at about that same time Apple

00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:32,509
approach

00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:34,239
full approach Netscape and said you know

00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:36,799
we're thinking about doing a new browser

00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:38,570
can you guys mock something up work

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,210
something up so that maybe we can put

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,779
gecko into a Coco browser like okay sure

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:48,559
sounds great so Vitter and I did a lot

00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:50,899
of work to to take the carbon widget

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,779
layer that was in that was in gecko at

00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:56,739
the time poured it to Coco and then be

00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:59,479
able to wrap that in a browser view and

00:22:56,739 --> 00:23:01,820
so the very beginning of that was NS

00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:04,099
browser view so we had something that we

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,129
could stick into a Coco application and

00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:09,440
make just a very simple browser and we

00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:11,149
called it NS browser view because you

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,710
know I had every intention that Apple is

00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:14,210
going to take this and build a browser

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,529
and we were going to stick gecko into

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,979
the operating system it is all going to

00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:20,649
be great obviously that didn't happen

00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:24,139
but that's another story for another day

00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:26,929
so we handle this code to allow people

00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:29,210
to to put gecko into a Coco application

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:31,519
and with all of this swirl about well

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,489
you know how do we make zool be be

00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,719
really good on the Mac we took a look at

00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,369
we said well we've got this other thing

00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:41,179
why don't we just build something in

00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:43,580
cocoa directly YMS was all at all it's

00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:45,229
you know it what Mac users really want

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,330
they want it to feel native they want it

00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:48,919
to be fast they want it they want all of

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,450
their keyboard shortcuts to work right

00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,789
they want the menus to work right they

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,529
want the buttons to to look the same way

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:55,940
as they do in all the other applications

00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:58,789
you know these are things that are very

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,919
important to Mac users and you know

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:05,210
maybe maybe let's try something on the

00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:07,039
side so a couple of us went off and high

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,139
it sort of started it and a bunch of us

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,049
sort of came in and we started doing

00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:15,830
this little Coco browser wrapped around

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:18,710
gecko and we did it as part of Mazda org

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,559
and not initially is part of Mozilla and

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,169
people in the community took notice I

00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,149
said you know this is kind of neat you

00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:28,609
know because it's fast it's native and

00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:31,239
it's gecko which meant that it had all

00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:33,979
of the power and all of the rendering

00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:36,790
compatibility that it's big brother in

00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:39,320
netscape 7 had

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,210
so people in the community started to

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,450
gravitate to this they saw that we had

00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,790
something you know it didn't really have

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,440
bookmarks and you know you could go back

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,030
and forth and maybe it maybe had a

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,020
bookmark bar at the time but it

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,210
certainly wasn't a full fried

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,550
full-fledged browser but they saw the

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,950
promise you know they saw these guys are

00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,809
going in the right direction i think i'm

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,600
gonna i'm going to follow them and so

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:06,820
through it was it was chimera at the

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,950
time camara 01 02 03 serious very quick

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,740
iterations we got to the point where we

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,540
had a sizable community following it

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,000
wasn't too many developers it was mostly

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,510
just a user following but even though it

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,300
didn't do everything its big brother did

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:25,040
people were really attracted to it and

00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,740
as part of that we were actually able to

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:34,010
get by off at Netscape to work on this

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:37,820
full-time so me and Simon Fraser Chris

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:40,850
sorry Kathy Brady Conrad Carlin a few

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,610
other folks this was our job our job was

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,160
to make a Netscape branded browser for

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,990
the Mac out of this little cocoa

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:53,270
open-source thing and we ended up

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:55,460
calling that Project X at the time so

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,510
I'd already moved back to move back to

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,309
Virginia I was still working for

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:03,920
netscape at the time so I guess this was

00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:06,340
2000 2001 2002 we were working for AOL

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,050
they well it had purchased Netscape and

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,970
we were working full time on Project X

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,460
we had dedicated QA we had dedicated

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,440
engineering we're just the small little

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,440
team of Mac people working on something

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,150
that we finally felt really good about

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,340
after the debacle of Netscape 6 where

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,960
you know none of us we all felt like we

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,580
just wanted to hang up our hats and not

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,190
even be software developers anymore it

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,720
was that bad we finally felt like we

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,970
were working on something that we're

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,040
proud of this is going to be really

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,800
great this is going to be you know

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,690
world-changing for netscape in terms of

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,120
its ability to say look we take the Mac

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,800
community seriously if this is what Mac

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,950
users want we're going to give it to you

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,110
so we created Project X we took the

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,230
Chimera open source we did a little bit

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,910
of rebranding

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,380
you know paid Netscape developers

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,230
working on it and we are going to

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,840
release it at macworld that year the the

00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,970
January macworld so we printed up all

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,799
these CDs I still got 10 or 20 of them

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,049
we printed up like 500 CDs we're going

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:07,110
to hand them out of macworld two days

00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:10,080
before that macworld a nail executive

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:14,190
named david gang who we all refer to as

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,500
dr. evil got wind project x he was like

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,770
what's this project X chimera thing I

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:23,040
don't understand it and it boiled down

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,590
to the fact that Netscape already had a

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:30,419
browser at Netscape seven or maybe 71 by

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:31,650
then and he as vp of marketing or

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,620
whatever position he was that at the

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,590
time he didn't he couldn't found them

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,150
how to actually market to browsers like

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,820
why ship this other one if you already

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,890
have Netscape 7 I can't understand no

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:47,880
don't do it so he pulled the plug on us

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,990
two days before macworld so you know

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,210
needless to say we're all completely

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,980
devastated to gank yeah we had CDs

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:57,320
burned in everything we're all ready to

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,320
go and then they pulled the plug on us

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,490
so we couldn't just let this thing die

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,049
you know we put so much work in all

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:08,309
right we're so proud of it we knew it

00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:10,470
was going to be something and so sort of

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:14,340
on the side a bunch of us just kept

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:16,679
working on it you know just the

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,419
day-to-day we'd spend a few hours some

00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,429
of our QA people they'd been reassigned

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,020
but they kept working on it and we

00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:23,850
finished it up we got it to a point

00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,580
where it was really stable it was really

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:29,190
high quality and we called that at that

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,080
point Camino we had to ship ship the

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,059
name for copyright reasons we call the

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,030
Camino oh point seven and we push that

00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:38,580
out the door and that was sort of a last

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,730
effort product of Netscape for for the

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:45,330
for the community and people loved it

00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,500
they went crazy you know they even if

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,450
they hadn't been following the whole

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,710
history they saw this and they tell

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,450
their friends and they tell two friends

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,790
and so on and so on and the word of

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,370
mouth was just it was just insane people

00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,740
love this little browser was fast it

00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,990
rendered the whole internet it was Mac

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,100
native you know it did all the things

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,970
that they wanted a brow

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,490
to do and so we were all very encouraged

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,200
like wow you know we can actually do

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,330
something that people really like it's

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,520
not it's not another Netscape 6 we ship

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,630
something people like and they one of

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,850
the main reasons they liked it was the

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,610
quality was so high you know it barely

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,260
crashed you know it didn't have very

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:26,940
many problems at all because we had this

00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:28,980
very high bar for release you know we

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,200
wouldn't ship it unless we were positive

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,960
that it was going to it was going to be

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,940
incredible incredible quality so now

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,340
what do we do next all right well

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,140
Netscape isn't around anymore to work on

00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,470
it you know none of those engineers so

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,000
we sort of have to we have to find other

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,980
people to work on it well that's our

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,470
community you know those are all those

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,080
people who had gravitated to the project

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:55,409
because of its ease of use and its speed

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,610
and it's growing success now started to

00:29:55,409 --> 00:30:03,510
become our open source community and so

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:07,440
408 we were able to to do it an entire

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:09,210
release cycle entirely done through the

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,940
open source community there was no

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:14,039
Netscape you know no assistance from any

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,570
paid corporation at that point it was

00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:18,419
done entirely by the open source

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,580
community we had QA you know people

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,679
downloading nightly builds and testing

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,530
them we found a lot of good developers

00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,150
people who are good in cocoa people who

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:30,510
understood the back end of gecko who

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:34,650
could help us out you know it really was

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:36,690
done entirely by the community and it

00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:40,740
was sort of a big step up for us because

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:43,799
we realize not just that people want to

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,200
use this but people want to participate

00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,820
in this people want to become part of

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,650
this community because we're doing the

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,330
right thing you know they even though

00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,400
they see that we don't have all the

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,280
bells and whistles you know it's not

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,289
completely done yet but they see the

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,020
promise and they see that they want to

00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:04,110
be a part of that so after we shipped

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,990
out on 8 which was which people loved

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:09,110
even more than 0 dot 7 and part of that

00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,490
was because the quality was even higher

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,740
we knew we had a tall order ahead of us

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,990
you know what what is the the big

00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,300
milestone in any open source

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,250
well it's it's that magical one point

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,050
out you know probably ninety nine

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:27,120
percent of open-source projects get to

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:28,860
version 01 297 a 4b and you know they're

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,470
just stuck that way on fresh meat for

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,320
the rest of their existence but we

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,000
wanted that we wanted real users to to

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,770
download our software and so we knew we

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,660
had to have that magical one point out

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,190
so if we didn't people would just look

00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,900
at it and compare us to those fresh meat

00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,429
things and say well what's the guarantee

00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,440
this won't delete my hard drive it's not

00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,330
done yet you know people have this

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,090
barrier at one point o that they won't

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,340
touch anything before that so we had to

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,650
get to that major milestone and getting

00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,840
to that major milestone meant that we

00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,179
had to have a quality that was as high

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,490
or higher than 08 which is really hard

00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,620
because we'd already set an incredibly

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:09,030
high bar for for ourselves with the

00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:10,590
previous two releases so it came down to

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,350
really just drawing a line in the sand

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:15,600
and saying we have to get this out we

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,640
can't just delay it until it's perfect

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,590
because we know it's never going to be

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,390
perfect we're the developers we see all

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,510
the warts the community reports the bugs

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,940
every day they see the warts you know we

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:30,510
don't we're not able to take a step back

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,720
and see all of the all of the promise of

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:35,429
this little application so finally we

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,170
just made the call we say you know at

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,720
the point we get it to the quality we're

00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,600
going to fix these you know 20 bugs and

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:47,460
we're going to one point out at the same

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:50,910
time we also had a documentation group

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,070
who rebranded our entire website along

00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:55,520
with one point oh so not only was it a

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:59,160
user release with a user-friendly

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:02,130
version number but we also switched to a

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,559
user-friendly website and all talk some

00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,050
more about that and we realize you know

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,650
we we finally got there we shipped one

00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:12,450
point oh I think februari of last year

00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:16,260
when we did it you know we went from

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:18,960
Ground Zero to something that gets you

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,210
know 100,000 or 200,000 downloads every

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,140
little dot revision that we that we

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,780
release solely through this community

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,220
this community of testers of designers

00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,169
of engineers

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,780
you know people who just download bugs

00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:35,010
and download builds and file bugs and

00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,169
that's their only connection to the

00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:39,210
project you know this this little

00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:43,350
community was able to ship something

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:45,539
that my mom and dad would use you know

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,059
it wasn't this geeky project that had

00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:50,880
200,000 preferences and you know you

00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:52,049
could send secure email from the URL bar

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,710
it was something that people actually

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:57,780
wanted to use and we did it so what do

00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:01,440
we learn from all of this so this is

00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:05,900
where a lot of the Mozilla history

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,570
really really plays in in terms of

00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:12,179
everything that we learned certainly

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:16,919
from the the grommet Raptor debacle

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,990
killing grommet we have to be completely

00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,590
open you know you have to be open with

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:25,320
your open source community Eric Raymond

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,700
said it best in cathedral Mazzarri said

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,399
be open almost to the point of

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,530
promiscuity you know just everything

00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,720
that you can possibly share you have to

00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,159
let your community in on because you

00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,869
lose a tremendous amount of Street

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,520
credit with them if you don't if you're

00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:41,280
going to make back you know back room

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,770
decisions then you're you're cutting

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,099
them out of their ability to feel like

00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,780
they're part of the project when when

00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,020
people feel like they're connected to a

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,669
project then they're going to be more

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,859
excited about it they're going to

00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:57,869
evangelize it to their friends they're

00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:00,180
going to be willing to download daily

00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:01,980
builds even though the quality from day

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,109
to day isn't that great and do their

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,210
normal work with them you know and then

00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:07,740
they'll go the extra mile of when they

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,810
find a bug they'll actually file it for

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,880
you because they care you know if you

00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,330
can get people excited if you can get

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,119
people to to see the promise of your

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,099
application though they'll get

00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,589
personally involved in helping you

00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,800
realize that goal and two then withhold

00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:28,380
information from them is to completely

00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,030
lock them out of that completely lock

00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,460
them out of that cycle so they'll just

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,619
say yeah well you know if you really

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,700
don't want to know what I have to say

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,380
you know I'm just going to go use

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,210
something else if you want them to be

00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,260
excited you want them to evangelize you

00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,060
want them to

00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,160
build your community because the

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,460
developers are all busy working you know

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:53,880
you we can't do it ourselves we need our

00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:57,540
community yeah another thing we learned

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,880
through Mozilla certainly was your

00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,010
communications with your users all needs

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,120
to be user centric so when Mozilla first

00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:08,820
started out 331 98 it was specifically

00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,880
meant for developers you know Mozilla

00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,980
wanted to distance itself from Netscape

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,410
completely and that Mozilla provided

00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,960
source code you know all they did their

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,700
only product was source code and if

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,440
somebody wanted to build it and put a

00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,210
logo on it and turn that into a product

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,730
they were free to do that from the

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,590
licenses and they felt that Netscape was

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,480
going to be the one doing that so they

00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,890
didn't want to release any binaries to

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,370
provide so there wouldn't be any

00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:38,700
confusion and the website the mozilla

00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:40,260
org who followed that same principle I

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,210
told you how to download the source I

00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,920
told you how to build it it told you

00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,480
know some developer documentation but

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,820
there was absolutely no user

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,590
documentation on the website and that

00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,510
progressed for years and years and years

00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,910
it just became more and more and more

00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,950
developer centric because that was the

00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,140
target audience even after they started

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,600
releasing builds there was almost no

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,970
user documentation so somebody would go

00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,560
to missoula org they might find how to

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,990
download one of the nightly builds or

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,420
one of the milestone builds and they'd

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,120
have no recourse to you know how do I

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,310
use this how do I set preferences how do

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:19,890
i do anything you know there was there

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:22,830
was no there's no priority on building a

00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:25,170
user community so we started out that

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,020
way with camino as well as well i was

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,430
doing the website in my spare time and

00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:32,130
my main goal was helping other

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,890
developers contribute to the project so

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:37,170
our website was was very developer

00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,030
centric it was difficult for users you

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,520
know we were targeting normal users we

00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:44,070
weren't targeting geeks so it's very

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,870
difficult for a lot of our users to to

00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,420
figure out some of the ins and outs of

00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:52,080
our software and they had again they had

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,940
no recourse so we needed a way to to

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,339
help both developers and you

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,530
become part of this community and so I

00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:01,349
was talking about with one point o weary

00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,869
retin rebranded our website in order to

00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:06,810
to make it much more user approachable I

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:09,420
think like the first four tabs of the

00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,490
website are now completely about being a

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,470
user about getting your questions

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,079
answered about finding ways to submit

00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,780
feedback you know user forums all of

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,760
that and then the very last tab is you

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,380
know oh by the way developers if you're

00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,109
really interested you can do all of this

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,859
and that shift really helped us grow our

00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:32,130
user community because now but before if

00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:33,359
they had a problem either they'd they'd

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,650
have a problem they wouldn't be able to

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,060
use the product for some reason or

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,640
another and they'd have no recourse

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,430
nowhere to turn but now we have the

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,770
website and we could probably solve

00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,960
their question in two minutes and now

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,400
we've turned a user that was probably

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,280
going to throw camino into the trash

00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,990
into somebody who's really excited about

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,880
the project is you know it was just that

00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,650
last one percent that they need it and

00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,180
now they have it and they're really

00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,770
excited and they're going to tell two

00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,849
friends and two friends and two friends

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:06,690
and so on so we've turned minus one user

00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:08,670
into a whole bunch of users just through

00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:13,859
our website just by having the right

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:15,960
focus on the website another very big

00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,599
lesson that we learned from Mozilla was

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,920
about ownership when we release the

00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:26,310
software through mozilla org every every

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,130
module every architectural component of

00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,530
the application had an owner such that

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:34,500
you know one person that that knew the

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:37,230
software they knew that piece of the

00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,790
product better than anybody else so that

00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,710
if changes needed to be made to that

00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,990
product to that section of the product

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,060
that person would be able to say yes

00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:47,069
that's a good no that's not you know I

00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,030
know how most of this stuff really works

00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:53,099
so you know this is good or it isn't the

00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,230
problem was probably ninety nine percent

00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,599
of those initial module owners were

00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,980
Netscape employees because that in we

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,440
were the ones working on it we were the

00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:05,069
developers and so you know we were the

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,740
ones that knew the code the best so when

00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,599
that transitioned over to mozilla org

00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,430
all of those Netscape employees became

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,960
those module owners and we're now

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,160
working with people in the open source

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,810
community directly well you know when

00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,359
you're working in a corporation there's

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:24,450
no guarantee that any particular person

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,880
is motivated or interested or you know

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,760
even cares about showing up to work

00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,960
people as a whole are generally lazy and

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,119
they just love collecting that paycheck

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,400
if they can sit there and play solitaire

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,710
all day and still get a paycheck heck

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,210
they're going to do that but the problem

00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,430
becomes what if that person is module

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,960
owner well they don't care you know they

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,220
probably don't even want to be a module

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,050
owner but they were given this job

00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,520
solely because that's the piece of code

00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,339
they were working on before it was open

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,980
sourced so now everything has to go

00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:55,380
through that person to fix bugs to make

00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,329
architectural changes to make any kinds

00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,800
of improvements or feature additions and

00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:02,220
if that person is completely

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,300
unresponsive the whole process breaks

00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:08,099
down it just backs up the community in

00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,849
general in general open source

00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:17,180
communities they tend to highly respect

00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:19,619
ownership so if there's no owner

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,540
somebody will step up or the community

00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,670
itself can decide all right these are

00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,800
the right things to do because nobody

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:29,730
else you know nobody else has the final

00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,410
say but if there is an owner then the

00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,869
community sort of takes a step back and

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,119
defers all the decisions to that owner

00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:39,569
just out of respect this person was

00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:43,190
granted this position for a reason you

00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:46,170
know this is a this is a community where

00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:49,410
you know where hard work and good work

00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:52,020
is rewarded through you know through

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,819
through more ownership and so just in

00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,560
general the open source community takes

00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:58,710
a step back when there is a de facto

00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,650
owner and if that owner isn't doing

00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,240
anything then it makes it very hard for

00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:07,079
the community to step up they don't want

00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,730
to assert that that you know that that

00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,700
privilege that had been bestowed upon

00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,020
that module owner you know don't want to

00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,270
step on their toes you know they were

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,220
given it for a reason so who are we to

00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,109
question them

00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,590
but if they're not doing anything it

00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:23,300
puts everybody in a really bad position

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,680
so one of the most important things I

00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,560
think I've learned throughout this

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,290
entire process is that a week owner is

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,880
worse than no owner at all it's better

00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:34,580
not to have any ownership of a module

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,680
let the community sort it out then to

00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,390
put a figure head up there who's not

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,599
going to do anything who doesn't care

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,700
who doesn't want to be there because

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,859
they're going to make it even worse than

00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:50,270
if they weren't there at all the other

00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:53,060
thing I've learned certainly through

00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:57,200
Camino is that testers are your most

00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:58,849
valuable resource hands down when you

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,470
know I talked in the beginning about how

00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:02,869
we wanted to harness this great hacker

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,359
community to come and fix our bugs and

00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:09,859
add new features and help us defeat

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:13,580
Microsoft as you know through writing

00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:17,869
all this code those developers never

00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:19,910
came you know we years and years went by

00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:21,890
and we got a few people and we generally

00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,390
ended up hiring them so there weren't

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,500
really all that many people in the open

00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,170
source community who are doing

00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,109
development we're submitting patches who

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,150
are doing any kind of riorca tech ting

00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:34,460
you know those those developers those

00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,310
hoards of angry hackers who hated

00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,200
Microsoft never showed up and it's a

00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,910
variety of reasons you know we can we

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,010
can go into them at length but the fact

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,980
is they just didn't the people that did

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:48,770
show up and this surprised everybody was

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,930
testers they didn't run away when we

00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,400
switched architectures because they

00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,290
didn't really care most of them aren't

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,450
technical you know most of them don't

00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:58,070
have CS degrees they don't care one

00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,900
rendering engine or another they just

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,910
want to browser to use and so they

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,290
didn't run screaming when we canceled

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,730
grommet and we switch to something else

00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:09,589
they just started testing something else

00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:11,420
your testers are also the people that

00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:13,540
help keep you honest there are the ones

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,040
that download your nightly builds and

00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,599
you know and provide you a sanity check

00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,760
all those things you checked in

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,760
yesterday do they work or do they not

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,830
work because it's easier to find out you

00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,109
know if I do a check-in today I'd rather

00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,580
know tomorrow that's something I broke

00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:29,220
that's something i did broke it rather

00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,260
than

00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,180
six weeks down the road because in six

00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,340
weeks you've got six weeks worth of

00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,320
possible changes that could be you know

00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,030
that could break things and it's your

00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,010
testers who are the ones who are testing

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,020
in these environments that you can't

00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,790
even imagine especially for something

00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,980
like a web browser where there is an

00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,540
infinite number of inputs you know

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,660
people can throw anything at a web

00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,099
browser and it has to be expected to

00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,730
either do the right thing and certainly

00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:58,530
not crash but most developers certainly

00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,859
ones working on a web browser you know

00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,750
you only go to 15 or 20 sites a day just

00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,490
in your general surfing you know you go

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,320
to the new site you read the blog's that

00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,050
you read or you know some of the other

00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,910
just weather sites but you don't go to

00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,640
that site in Pakistan that's going to

00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,560
crash your browser but someone in your

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,240
testing community because they're spread

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,310
throughout the entire world they're not

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,010
just in cubes next to you doing the

00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,390
exact same thing they're the ones who

00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,070
are testing in these different

00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,050
situations they're the ones behind

00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,910
different firewalls they're the ones who

00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,890
have different proxies they're the ones

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,540
on completely different operating

00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,250
systems with totally different software

00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,109
installed and more importantly they're

00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:40,050
the ones throwing different input at it

00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:42,599
foreign languages you know websites

00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:45,270
behind security that you couldn't get to

00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:47,430
all of these wonderful bits of

00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:50,359
information that you and your little

00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:53,910
room of testers never would have found

00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:57,630
you know so you know you've you've

00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:59,550
opened up from from just a small amount

00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,339
of a small amount of testing to

00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,740
literally anybody can help you test and

00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:08,220
those people really are the ones who are

00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:10,050
most valuable the the other thing that a

00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:13,230
lot of the testers I've run into a

00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:15,570
really good at is they're good at

00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,400
recognizing patterns they don't have to

00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:23,640
have a CS background yet they're still

00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:25,859
able to contribute very good analysis of

00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,020
what a bug probably is you know they'll

00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:29,580
go they'll be able to look at the bug

00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,500
database and see what was checked in

00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,390
they'll be able to look at some of the

00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,180
files that may have been modified and

00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:39,119
just even by their file names you know

00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,190
if something crashes in a text field and

00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,990
yesterday somebody checked in something

00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,880
in NS text field

00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:46,950
chances are probably good that they're

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,780
related and you don't you know you don't

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:51,090
need ten years of cs to be able to make

00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,890
that connection and so it's it's these

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:55,340
people who have the time who aren't just

00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,750
head down fixing bugs day in and day out

00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,090
who can make these types of connections

00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,650
you can say oh this is similar to that

00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:04,440
other bug because they have a similar

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,970
stack trace and now the developer only

00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,400
has to fix one thing instead of two

00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,140
because the community has done that

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,110
triage for them the community has

00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:15,480
recognized the patterns that so that the

00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:18,480
developer doesn't have to and that is

00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,450
that is a very as a very strong trait of

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,150
a lot of QA communities is they can see

00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,750
these patterns develop and they can make

00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,580
a lot of very very accurate descriptions

00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,500
about what is going on without actual

00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:34,200
knowledge of or understanding of what

00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,869
goes on under it what's key to that is

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,060
having an open bug database if you don't

00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:41,190
have an open bug database you've cut out

00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,890
a tremendous amount of information from

00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:45,720
your testers you know their their main

00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,119
ability to make these connections or to

00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,590
be able to see other bugs or see what

00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,180
was fixed or see what other things may

00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,210
have come up in the last couple of weeks

00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,400
that could be other duplicates of this

00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:02,550
or just other manifestations of this or

00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,140
somehow related and if you if you take

00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:08,040
all of that information away from them

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,990
they're just flying blind you know you

00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,070
people would file bugs and they go into

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:14,609
the ether and you would have absolutely

00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:19,530
no idea as a reporter if you were right

00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:21,540
or you know if or able to make a

00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,160
connection to something to to another

00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,480
bug or another issue and end up saving a

00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:29,430
developer a tremendous amount of time

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,960
doing here okay the other thing i didn't

00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,940
mention on the previous slide is that

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,260
testers are also very good at reducing

00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,700
test cases making making very small

00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,990
reduced test cases the again the

00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,119
developer doesn't have to waste a

00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:46,109
tremendous amount of time picking

00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:50,640
through 200k of HTML on CNN com to find

00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:51,990
why a table is off by three pixels you

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,609
know if somebody would just file a bug

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,700
and say the tables off by three pixels

00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:56,109
that

00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,480
probably two weeks of work for the

00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:01,270
developer but if someone in the

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,710
community if that's their donation if

00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,349
that's their contribution to the project

00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,960
can take a week or week and a half and

00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:11,260
narrow wittle all of that down to five

00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:13,000
lines of HTML and some CSS and then give

00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,380
that to the developer the developer

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,140
could probably fix that in a day you

00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,820
know so that is a tremendous

00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:21,310
contribution to a project even though it

00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:24,310
doesn't really it never shows up in

00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:28,030
terms of actual written code it is still

00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:30,730
a very very sizable contribution the

00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:33,690
last bullet here about process is also

00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:38,650
very useful time back to being open

00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:41,800
Mozilla does a reasonable job of putting

00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:43,869
all of its release process into the bug

00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,980
system so you can tell when bugs are

00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:47,320
going to be filed when they've been

00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,880
targeted to be fixed when they have been

00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,300
fixed when they're not going to be fixed

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,609
etc so everybody knows when the product

00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,410
is getting ready for release because

00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:59,349
they can see okay the the number of bugs

00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:02,050
that we have to fix for Firefox two

00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:03,460
point oh whatever is down to four things

00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:06,670
because they can do that query in the

00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,770
bug system and directly see the

00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,390
developers are getting close you know

00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,430
you don't need to talk directly to the

00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,530
product management you can infer quite a

00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,619
bit about how the project works and how

00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:19,390
the project does its releases through

00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:21,280
the bug system so again if your bug

00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,990
system is closed you've cut off a

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,730
tremendous amount of information from

00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,020
your community because your community

00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,630
really cares when you're getting ready

00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,710
to ship that's when you know that's when

00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:33,730
they want to step it up themselves

00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:35,680
because any bugs it you know any bugs

00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,720
that they don't find are in some sense

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,609
and reflection on them if they consider

00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,859
them their contribution to be testing

00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:44,050
they want to find all the bugs so they

00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:46,060
want to make sure they step up when you

00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:48,040
get ready to to release and if you don't

00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:52,270
communicate any of that you've lost that

00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,560
that huge contribution another major

00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,420
thing that we learned throughout the

00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,359
entire Mozilla process is you just can't

00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,130
please everybody you really shouldn't

00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:02,650
even try they're always going to be

00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:05,859
people out there who want their pet

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:07,360
feature who just completely disagree

00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:10,120
with everything that youre

00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,740
trying to do and sometimes you just have

00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,020
to state take a step back and say I'm

00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:17,320
sorry you know we we can't make this

00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,720
work what Mozilla tried to do in the

00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,360
beginning because we lost so many

00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,220
developers at the start when we switch

00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,780
rendering engines or weren't very

00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,850
receptive to things from from the

00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:32,080
community when developers did start to

00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:33,400
show up you know we were so overjoyed we

00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,040
didn't want to say anything that could

00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,620
possibly turn them away we never wanted

00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,260
to say no we never wanted to anger these

00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:43,480
people so that they'd run off again so

00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,360
we always said yes you know someone

00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,970
would come to us with a feature to add

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:51,580
sending mail from the URL bar and it

00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:54,340
would be perfectly written code you know

00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,410
perfectly optimized it was you know

00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:58,930
rocket fast and didn't call slowdowns

00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:01,570
anywhere else it didn't leak all the one

00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:03,070
you know very well architected and we'd

00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:04,570
say awesome thank you for your

00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,860
contribution we're going to stick it in

00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,320
so that you feel like you've contributed

00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,330
to this open-source project and you feel

00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,940
important and nobody ever stop to ask

00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,550
wait a minute do we really want to be

00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:18,640
able to send mail from the URL bar

00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:21,010
probably not and so we ended up with a

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,980
product that was full of all of these

00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:25,600
weird little features all of these weird

00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,820
preferences because all right so we'd

00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,530
add this send mail from the URL bar

00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,570
feature and what we couldn't really

00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:33,460
agree or disagree on whether we wanted

00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,840
so let's add a pref so let the user

00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,460
decide whether or not they want to add

00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,080
that so now we've added this feature

00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:40,630
that we probably don't want it all and

00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,980
now we have an extra preference so

00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,740
you've got you know tons of features

00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:47,110
that just bog everything down make the

00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,940
architecture more complicated make it

00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,770
more difficult for developer for other

00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,780
developers to contribute because you got

00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:55,180
to wade through all this extra craft and

00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,700
you've also added a lot of extra cruft

00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,770
visibly to your user in terms of

00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,300
enabling and disabling all these weird

00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,650
little things that ninety-nine point

00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,520
nine percent of them don't even

00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:09,550
understand let alone care about

00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,410
so there comes there comes a time when

00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:14,020
you absolutely need to be able to say no

00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,670
to somebody you know it doesn't matter

00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,380
if the patch is perfect if it's well

00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:19,450
architected if it's a beautiful

00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,700
implementation if it's not a feature you

00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:24,250
want you have to be prepared to say no

00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,380
and thank you very much but we don't

00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:28,930
want this and that was one of the main

00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,940
problems that that Mozilla sort of still

00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:33,070
has to this day but it's one thing that

00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:36,880
we decided very early on in Camino was

00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:38,950
going to be sort of a you know a guiding

00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,630
principle that we were going to say no

00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,610
more than we were going to say yes and

00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,860
that's part of the that I think that's a

00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:47,020
major reason for a lot of its success it

00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,800
doesn't have all of these crazy weird

00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:53,560
features it doesn't have 300 preferences

00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,170
you know in addition to that it's not

00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,480
just me as the owner stepping up and

00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:00,550
saying no it's the community being able

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,830
to police that and enforce that if you

00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:04,420
can teach your community that this is

00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,860
important that in order to ship

00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,510
something that real people can

00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,120
understand we can't say yes to

00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:12,280
everything then the community has to be

00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:16,780
self policing the community has to be

00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,460
able to tell itself you know I know you

00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,630
really want to work on this but you

00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,640
should be working on this other thing

00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,920
instead because I don't have time as the

00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,770
lead to do that for everybody and once

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,950
once you you teach your community how to

00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:32,200
do that it becomes self-sustaining new

00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,880
people that come on try and do something

00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,640
and they get their hands slapped and

00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,250
they get the religion and they

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,290
understand you know where the project is

00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,390
going and what is important and what is

00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,890
not important and they then can help

00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:47,560
teach other people who come into the

00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,030
community and a single person doesn't

00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,420
have to do a tell a single person

00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:55,540
doesn't have to do everything all right

00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:59,680
so where we going for now we released

00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:02,050
1.1 a to about a week ago which is a you

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,910
know it's it's got a scary long fresh

00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,790
meat version number on it but it's

00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:08,260
actually really stable it's quite good

00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:11,740
I'm using it and I generally don't

00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:13,720
update to nightly builds or anything but

00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:18,070
one of the things that it's really drove

00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,740
home to me is that are our goal of

00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:22,580
perfect

00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:25,340
Shin of not being even a smidge worse

00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:28,490
than the last release has given us this

00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:31,550
this paralysis we're afraid to ship

00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:33,350
anything because oh my god what if it

00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:35,450
what if it crashes or what if it's a

00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,480
little bit slower or what if it doesn't

00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:40,250
do everything perfectly and we set this

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,320
very high bar and it's part of what's

00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,090
made camino very successful but it's

00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,270
it's tied our hands behind our back

00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:49,280
we're not able to to get things out and

00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:51,440
release things to our user community and

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,320
get that feedback and get that that

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,240
cycle of you know they submit us

00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,860
feedback we integrate it and we push out

00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,380
another bill to sort of release early

00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,300
release often which is very very useful

00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,430
in open source communities we've lost

00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:08,420
all of that because we're so terrified

00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:10,100
of well you know we've added so many new

00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,660
features and its really great but on

00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,200
this one website it might crash

00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:16,610
sometimes we can't ship it and so we

00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,830
need to get out of that we need to find

00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:21,470
a way out of that you know may be doing

00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:23,750
more frequent alphas is a way to to help

00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:25,850
build us out of that but we really need

00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,530
to put 1.1 to bed and ship it you know

00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:29,900
it's been like a year and a half since 1

00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:32,720
point 0 and we have so many new features

00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,250
and I can't even I can probably talk for

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,050
an hour on the new features that we've

00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,460
added to it and they're all good things

00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,920
they're not geeky things they're things

00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:42,500
that people in our in our community have

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,240
been asking for for a very long time so

00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,830
we have to find a way to ship and I

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,560
think the only way we can do that is

00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:51,020
draw a line in the sand ship it and move

00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,850
on move on to 1.2 so we're really trying

00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,710
to get one point at one point one out in

00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:56,869
February or march and then we're going

00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:59,359
to hopefully do a very quick release in

00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:02,060
1.2 for the bigger things that we

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:04,130
couldn't actually get to in 1.1 and just

00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:06,140
start a more frequent release train

00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:08,650
because this paralysis is just killing

00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,650
the project

00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:14,940
moving forward beyond that where do we

00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,010
go there's a lot of different directions

00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:19,140
what does a two point O mean you know

00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,880
one point o was a gigantic milestone for

00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:24,869
an open source project what is to point

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,369
out what about leaving behind some of

00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:28,829
the older operating systems right now we

00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:32,359
go back to 10 3 1 point 0 goes back to

00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:34,349
10 to how many people are still on 10 2

00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:36,710
there's a lot of things that Apple's

00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:39,150
coming out with core animation is

00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:42,089
spectacular is there any you know maybe

00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:44,760
if we make to point out leopard only we

00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:47,220
can do all of these awesome things that

00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:51,720
our users really want that flash that

00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:53,430
polished that apple style and deliver

00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,020
that in such a way you know with a

00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,490
really good browsing experience you know

00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:00,180
just supporting all of these previous

00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:02,369
operating systems tie our hands maybe we

00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,380
should think about WebKit top of the

00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:06,510
trunk on WebKit really really fast

00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,339
problem is it still doesn't render half

00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:10,410
the web you know that's one of the big

00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:13,349
that's one of the big features of Kamino

00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:15,869
is this that Mozilla power it renders

00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:17,609
the web you know it you don't run into

00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:19,829
the same problems you do in Safari I

00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:21,780
can't surf with Safari that's the main

00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:27,000
reason I'm still doing Camino I can't

00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:28,410
use Safari you know we also have a big

00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,030
question about what are we going to do

00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,099
moving forward with the Mozilla

00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:34,800
Foundation the Mozilla Foundation has

00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:36,329
made it fairly clear certainly through

00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,000
the corporation that all they care about

00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:41,190
is Firefox it's all it's all Firefox all

00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,560
the time if you're not firefox you are

00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,710
not important and that is pretty much

00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:48,060
the the direct message we received from

00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:49,470
certainly from the corporation there are

00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:52,050
some people within the foundation who

00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:55,470
are still very helpful to us but by and

00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:58,380
large if you're not firefox you know why

00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:00,900
are you here and so that brings up a big

00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,670
question of so why are we still why are

00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,950
we still tying ourselves to Mozilla if

00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,720
they don't care about us at all camino

00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,060
really is the redheaded stepchild of

00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,460
mozilla you know we're trying so hard to

00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,230
be a good community citizen for our

00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,630
parents provide all of this extra

00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:17,099
testing through you know through our own

00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,680
testing community through our own QA

00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,040
community and we get very little in

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,160
return what we do get in return is

00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:27,240
tender

00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:28,590
foxes use of the bug system in the bug

00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,570
system is very important we don't want

00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:32,670
to really fork the bugs because most of

00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,560
the bugs are in the rendering engine

00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:37,110
that's shared with firefox we want to be

00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,820
in the same bug system we also want to

00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,560
be using their build system their build

00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:43,500
machines because they're inside the

00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,850
firewall so we can use talkback and if

00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,400
we didn't you know if we weren't on that

00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:49,650
same system we wouldn't be able to

00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,870
upload symbols we we think we may have a

00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,970
solution for that in the medium term but

00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,160
nothing in the short term so we're sort

00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:57,690
of tied to them for some process but

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,690
we're really not at all tied to them in

00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:02,220
terms of goals so that's a big question

01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,280
for me and some of the other leads on

01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,810
the project is you know how do we how do

01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,360
we keep up this relationship with the

01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:11,010
Mozilla Foundation after all they've all

01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:15,750
they've done for us and all they haven't

01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:18,510
done for us so that's actually all i

01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:21,000
have for the talk i wanted to open up

01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:24,030
for for QA for about 10 or 15 minutes i

01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,040
want to remind everybody that this is

01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:28,200
being broadcast publicly it's being

01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,960
recorded for public broadcast so please

01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,870
don't ask anything google sensitive

01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,490
because then we won't be able to do that

01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:37,140
if it's possible if you could go up to

01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:38,610
the mic to ask the questions that make

01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,170
it so that i don't have to repeat it but

01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:44,000
i will certainly repeat questions for

01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:44,000
the people on the phone they're already

01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:49,800
so the question was how many users do we

01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,510
have we don't have a really good

01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:55,109
estimate of that we really only have

01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:57,630
just download numbers but probably over

01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:59,430
time over all the different versions i

01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:01,470
would imagine we've amassed about about

01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:07,790
a quarter of a million maybe 200,000

01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:10,050
that's that's a very rough guess yep oh

01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,780
I'm sorry I didn't say that the name of

01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:18,830
the documentary is called code rush it's

01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:18,830
a PBS documentary sorry about that yeah

01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:31,560
sure sure so certainly in web kits favor

01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,119
it's much simpler like four for new

01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,550
developers coming on to the Camino

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,520
project or even to any gecko project the

01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:45,140
learning curve is tremendous gecko is a

01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:49,170
very complicated very very

01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:50,550
unapproachable system and so anybody who

01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:52,020
wants to try and do any sort of

01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,900
development unless they can stay at the

01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,280
most the very highest level and not have

01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,010
to get down into any of the rendering

01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,920
engine stuff you know they they need to

01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:05,480
learn X be calm and all of just all of

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,480
the the crazy in Phest

01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,220
it's much easier

01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:11,260
to get your brain around so it's much

01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,420
more approachable to new developers so

01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,550
we think we might with sort of a switch

01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:18,819
like that we might be able to get a lot

01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:20,500
more developers coming to our cause just

01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:24,190
because they don't have to learn all of

01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:26,470
this craziness of gecko you know

01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:28,030
certainly the obvious differences of web

01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,680
compatibility which is another main

01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:32,619
reason we're sticking with gekka right

01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,050
now but you know Apple has full-time

01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:36,849
people paid to work on this project and

01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:38,440
so you know they're they're working

01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:41,380
really hard on improving that that

01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:45,670
compatibility WebKit has gotten quite a

01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:47,260
bit faster so even though you know Steve

01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,849
Jobs likes to stand up and say safaris

01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:51,160
the fastest web browser on the Mac I

01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,960
can't see why he's saying that because

01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,450
pretty much every user that we get

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,780
feedback from says camino feels so much

01:02:55,450 --> 01:03:00,490
faster than safari so you know take that

01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,990
for what it's worth but that's you know

01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:05,050
that's what I hear from from the user

01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:08,410
community but none of them are running

01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:10,300
the WebKit that is top of the trunk that

01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,250
is in the open source builds right now

01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:15,130
that hasn't shipped yet and it's in

01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:17,319
theory a lot faster so some of the speed

01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:21,010
improvements maybe may narrow that gap

01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:22,900
quite a bit but mostly mostly it's the

01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:25,990
brain print that's that's the biggest

01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:28,359
one yeah well Marcus how do you deal

01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,280
with the Rocksteady get go back so

01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:32,670
stupid around

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,800
years and years somehow they're very

01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:37,500
vague but they never get fixed yet so

01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,970
the question is how do we how do we deal

01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,110
with the long-standing gecko bugs that

01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:44,000
have been there forever like the

01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:46,920
four-digit ones and and all of that

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,410
sometimes they do get fixed sometimes we

01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,080
we get people who are just so absolutely

01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:54,060
annoyed by them that they take it upon

01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,880
themselves to go and fix them most of

01:03:54,060 --> 01:04:00,000
the time however they just stay there

01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,940
you know we we hope that people being

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,130
paid by the mozilla corporation will fix

01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,290
them because that you know they're

01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:09,360
they're actually paid to work on Firefox

01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,950
and fix those types of bugs and there

01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,500
are a couple of people at the

01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:16,470
corporation like Josh who are paid to do

01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,710
Mac stuff so we sort of like to let Josh

01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:21,510
do a lot of that some of them also end

01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:23,550
up going away by moving to newer

01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:27,600
technologies like a lot of the bugs that

01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:31,860
we had in not being able to render some

01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:33,750
internationalisation or do some kind of

01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,700
different types of international layout

01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,320
are solved by the new rent the new

01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,150
graphics layer cairo that they're

01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,460
putting in because it's on top of courts

01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:43,590
instead of carbon so we get some of that

01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,530
for free but there are still quite a few

01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:47,880
four digit bugs that you know every Mac

01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,850
user just shakes their head and says

01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,610
yeah this really should be better but

01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:57,260
you know it's a volunteer project so we

01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:57,260
need somebody just to step up and do it

01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,460
yeah

01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:05,829
wondering that like the you know

01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:09,600
over to bargain

01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:17,130
better than the catfisher

01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:18,090
right the question is camino seems to

01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:22,470
support a lot of Google applications

01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:25,140
better than WebKit a lot of it is we we

01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:27,330
get we get a lot of that for free

01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:30,600
through gecko now our use of gecko just

01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:33,840
allows us to just work but there is a

01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:36,060
lot of there is also a job of JavaScript

01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:42,650
side of it so I think that's about all I

01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:42,650
can say in public so anyone else

01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:49,180
this is crazy I'm all about the crazy

01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,240
get the rendering

01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:04,930
not that I know of but that is a really

01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,930
good idea I mean I

01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:14,410
so the question was it has anybody taken

01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:17,800
a look at at putting WebKit api's on top

01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:22,930
of geckos embedding api's and the short

01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:24,100
answer is no the longer answer is it's

01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:30,910
certainly something to think about

01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:34,840
moving forward but there hasn't really

01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:37,150
been a lot of desire nobody's really

01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,400
asked for that you know so it would be

01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:41,890
great to be able to put gecko inside

01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,130
safari or something happy like that but

01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:47,230
we we aren't finding companies coming to

01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,570
the Mozilla Foundation and saying you

01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:52,720
know we want to build this this web app

01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:53,980
this native web app on the mac and it

01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,660
would be wonderful but we want to use

01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,880
gecko instead can you give us these

01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:59,140
types of api's you know nobody's

01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,270
nobody's really asking for it because

01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:04,150
safari web kits already on the machine

01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:05,050
and it's good enough so people don't you

01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,880
know you don't want to take the extra

01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:10,540
download hit you don't want to take the

01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,880
extra complexity you know bugs you know

01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:15,310
it to some extent you you you have a

01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,570
more open process with the bugs but for

01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,220
a developer it's also a lot more

01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:19,630
difficult because you know you're not

01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:22,570
just working with something already

01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:24,340
present on the operating system so I you

01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,140
know I I can see how it would be useful

01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:28,630
and we sort of thought about that when

01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:31,360
WebKit first came out but since nobody

01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:33,720
ever asked for it it kind of dropped by

01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,720
the wayside

01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,099
ok well if nobody else has any questions

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,720
I want to thank you all for coming and

01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:42,760
certainly thank our host Lesley

01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:46,800
Hawthorne the on the open source speaker
