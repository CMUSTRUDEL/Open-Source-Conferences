ABSTRACT

Learn about New Zealand from two of their biggest open-source developers and evangelists (and who have naturally starred in The Lord Of The Rings.)

Sam Minnee and Sigurd Magnusson are two of the three founders of New-Zealand based "SilverStripe", a company and open source project with ten students participating in this year's Google Summer of Code.

They will share wisdom learnt managing people in an open source project, share ideas from developing a rich web interface and templating system, and stories from wearing the ring of darkness. Sigurd has been living and breathing free software since his teens in the 1990s, discovering a 486 with Redhad...

programs office and were privileged to

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,600
have here with us today to founding

joining us later for the QA and Ziggy is

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,930
going to talk to us today a little bit

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,150
about the silver stripe content

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,580
management system their participation in

00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,070
google Summer of Code program as well as

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,460
anything else new zealand and new

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,690
zealand already is he thank you all

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,790
right what I'm going to start this off

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,430
by just saying thank you very much to

00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,570
Leslie and also Chris DiBona who you

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,920
know we haven't done a whole lot of

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,210
things together but when if there has

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,979
been anything that we've done to give it

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,690
might be an email might be dinner it's

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,850
always very fun and it's always very

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,119
productive so thank you for that all

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,740
right so I'm going to talk a wee bit as

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,509
Lisa mentioned about New Zealand and

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,350
some of the software that has come out

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,700
of the country I'm also going to talk a

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,250
wee bit about I don't know if I Leslie

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,290
circulator but they'll talk about some a

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,420
lot of a ring stuff what's he going to

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,360
mention some of the mistakes that we've

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,740
made that you don't need to make but

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,210
also some mistakes that you should make

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,010
and yes Leslie mentioned we've had a

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,930
fantastic run of google summer of code

00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,729
so i just wanted to share some of our

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,430
experiences with that so you're going to

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,810
feel for what has been produced and also

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,549
again to some of the lessons that we've

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,380
learned so new zealand how we've got

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,659
four million people and about 100 square

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,900
miles so i was just up an oz car last

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,560
week and it's quite a similar match

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,450
unfortunately i couldn't find anything

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,250
to relate it to in terms of California

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,840
or San Francisco but hopefully you've

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,549
been to oregon so no that's all about

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,100
unlike america which supposedly was

00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:12,600
settled tens of thousands of years ago

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,489
we were found very very recently which

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,620
is quite nice because when people find a

00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:18,000
country like generally start killing

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,549
everything and devastating it so we've

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,010
had a really short period of time in

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:27,150
which to destroy our own country so it's

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,220
still quite pristine it's quite nice the

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,209
European discovery was even more recent

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,830
and so from 1630 for us when white

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,300
people started to

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,630
clamber over the place and it basically

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,080
led up to 18 40 in which the treaty

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,240
between indigenous people d'marie signed

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,480
and basically pass over their authority

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,930
to the Queen of England and that's

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,850
basically when mass emigration began you

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,680
know too well mess to it to a

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,760
four-million point the ever-increasing

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
you think about New Zealand's we

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,620
actually have real coffee there I think

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,910
you know despite all of these wonderful

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,110
attributes of civilization I think

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,280
America's still has an order to learn

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,740
they're interesting as well we also have

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,910
a female Prime Minister and before I go

00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,700
off and say that you should vote for

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,080
Hillary or anything like that I think it

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,709
has helped actually I think it's quite

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,209
nicely but quite liberal politics and it

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,750
does it does does make for quite a nice

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,580
place to live as you can imagine given

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,530
that we're 10,000 miles away from

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,510
everywhere the economy is very reliant

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,780
on export and traditionally because we

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:38,100
were founded out of England in terms of

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,989
the party high race it basically just

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,340
meant that we should fall about goods to

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,040
England and that's really supported our

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,560
economy now that there's a much more

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,830
ferocious world economy we've had to

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,780
think about smarter and so things that

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,430
had typically been funding us from

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,600
England have now been reduced and so

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,930
we're now until things like software

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,640
movies lot of rings we were in Seattle

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,290
last week and we noticed that it was New

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,239
Zealand wine for sale things like that

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,480
so we actually obviously getting up

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,950
there and as you know you know it's a

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,060
lovely place of business I expect all of

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,410
you to come to New Zealand after this

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,709
presentation so some of the things that

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,840
New Zealand has gone well it's quite a

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,390
short talk so I conveyors basically just

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,650
explain you know one example in

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,870
different kind of areas so for instance

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,690
Jada's than the larger kind of

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,690
educational enterprise final area and

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,160
has been running for a decade or more I

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,169
guess more in the kind of

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,030
entrepreneurial side of it would be a

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,950
guy called rod drury made a lot of money

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,870
with after males so after Enron I

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,340
believe does legislation that meant that

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,340
all emails had to be saved and preserved

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,730
so you can just delete them

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,370
and kind of arrays you know your history

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,080
and so after mailstore of your email so

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,370
that when it was a discovery process and

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,400
the courts they could go through all the

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,320
emails and find you to be you know

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,760
guilty of some crime stuff like that so

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,580
he meant a lot of money after the hole

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,040
in one thing and that then when turn 20

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,479
so he's now doing a start-up where he is

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,729
producing a software-as-a-service

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,500
application for small businesses to run

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,419
their accounting so it's desam pretty

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,639
cool stuff on a completely different

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,600
tangent there's an academic called Peter

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,729
Goodman and he's been working in the PGP

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,100
world he's been essentially helping

00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,950
refugees escape the countries and water

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,570
on conflicts is quite neat really he's

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,160
been able basically to save people's

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,780
lives because people are saying well I

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,060
need a little one day viewpoint the army

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,200
is going to kill me kind of thing where

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,880
should we meet and obviously you don't

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,830
want anyone to sit there so PGP has been

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,740
used there so that's quite cool he also

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,889
wrote the longest suicide note in

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,990
history well not so he he described

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,120
Microsoft CRM as the longest suicide

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,979
note on history so if you google that

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,780
phrase will come up with a very long

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,700
article that was on slashdot probably

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,190
about six months ago so that was quite

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,020
cool i denti gained enough of completely

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,580
area is planet secure they share our

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,830
office back in wellington in new zealand

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,300
and that's another software as a service

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,370
application that's very quickly making

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,139
progress and that's for small startups

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,690
to be able to share information of the

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:10,070
staff the directors the VCS the

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,380
investors and so on about what the

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,639
company is doing and so on because often

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,110
with business plan to sign will get

00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,490
created and then just kind of thrown

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,039
away and no one knew what was going on

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,419
so it's sort of like a base camp for

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,930
some of your own business you know that

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:26,330
kind of idea and again is a company and

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,310
one it's been called catalyst and that's

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,639
probably along with us one of the major

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,580
open-source organizations in new zealand

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,050
and they really contribute to large open

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,240
source projects like moodle which is a

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,250
learning system and perl and Mahara

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,960
which is interesting as a one that's

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,530
actually been created in new zealand

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,080
rather than say moodle and pearl which

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,919
basically new zealand examples of us

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,270
contributing allowed to wider more

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,270
global projects

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,129
so my often last you know what is a

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,800
really nice example of how open sources

00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,659
used in New Zealand so quite proud to

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,300
say that the democratic process is

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:08,430
actually run an open source so pearl

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,840
says Mason in terms of the front end and

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,680
a programming language it's a web-based

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,300
thing basically ties in with postgres

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,340
and so all of the people who are

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,270
eligible to vote in new zealand that's

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,770
all stored in the system and so that

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,020
this is really really cool and in in

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,460
terms of devoting there are lots of

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,599
elements open source software used here

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,780
as well so that's really really nice and

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:36,539
then finally there's also another couple

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,669
of people know about and lets us and so

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,280
silverstripe that's our company with 18

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,690
people and we make our money from

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,180
building websites you've done that since

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,889
2000 but we spend about twenty percent

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,740
of our time actually on the open-source

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:52,500
off room and I guess just to give you a

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,000
little bit of context I will just spend

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,289
you know just once but a couple slides

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,150
on what the product that is before

00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:01,199
launching into I guess more general

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,909
information it will help you so of my

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,169
children only one of them is a web-based

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:12,599
open source product and it's still the

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:14,190
strap as you can see it's got you know

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,110
quite a variation and tombs ID actual

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,740
design that it can do and it's got out

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,210
of a box seeing it so it's kind of 38

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,860
second overview is the fact that it's

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,569
bigger than a blog that does more than

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,150
something that Nick know like WordPress

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,219
might do but it still retains some of

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,599
the things like being on to just get it

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:35,490
up and going you don't have to construct

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:37,229
the system itself at the same time you

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,969
don't have to sort of betch around for

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,740
so long you know as you might work

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,089
larger and more heavyweight open source

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,099
and close those programs to kind of get

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,230
it going so it's a little bit like you

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,699
know one of the guys that as Khan was

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,050
talking about how a lot of projects

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:52,410
ended up kind of being like a big small

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,850
car truck and we kind of see that you

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,949
know a lot of the pawns of a CMU space

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,720
islet that just trying to do too much

00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:00,630
and so we're trying to focus on us this

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,190
in-between space where people live just

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,480
haven't really focused on and done very

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,720
well another big differentiator and this

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,490
is

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,889
I'm going to tie into about how do you

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,980
run an open source project is that we

00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,509
have focused on the usability for the

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,629
site manager you know a lot of other

00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:21,060
systems out there tied too much the

00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,920
development person and a slight content

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,420
manager together and so you had an

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,529
interface that wasn't really good for

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,269
either and as I mentioned yeah it's a

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:33,540
system that both worked out on a box but

00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,680
it's really easy to customize all right

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,560
so that gives you a little bit of

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:44,129
context for the rest of my chap so now I

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:46,139
can move on to destroying the ring so I

00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,019
did promise to talk about some of the

00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,759
little rings things and essentially all

00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,800
of New Zealand participated little rings

00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,420
if you weren't riding a horse in front

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,129
of the camera you were at least feeding

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,439
the horse or making a costume for the

00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,600
horse or something like that pretty much

00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:02,370
everyone was either directly involves or

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,490
had a friend who was or something like

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,139
that it was pretty cool they had a very

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,910
strict policy that you were not allowed

00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,800
to make cameras on to the set so what I

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,089
did was just run home before to make up

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,410
on me and just take a photo of me at

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:21,029
home so that seemed to work all right um

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,769
so yeah so I mean essentially Sam and I

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,259
who have both actually extras on the

00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:29,250
Lord of the Rings starred in this whole

00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:32,430
sequence twice one making billions of

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,529
dollars and in secondly with our own

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,300
product I mean because one of the major

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,800
themes all of Lord of the Rings was this

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,980
whole notion that if you have too much

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,360
power then basically human race doesn't

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,949
know exactly how to deal with it you

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,620
know the greed kind of overwhelms you

00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:49,439
and you really just you know you just

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,240
you just abuse it really right and so it

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,629
was interesting when they're asked on

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,470
there was this nice debate between

00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:59,790
Oracle in alfresco who you'll know you

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,410
know Oracle's due to open source stuff

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,120
there they were basically talking about

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,699
you know one being very controlling

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,470
making a lot of money and one being far

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:11,819
more open and and you know providing a

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,649
lot more Liberty and yeah so we

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:15,209
destroyed the ring we we decided that we

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,189
didn't want to have you know all of this

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,389
greed and power and so on that was it

00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,170
was just going to kill us we actually

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:22,389
just wanted to destroy the ring

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,769
and the open source so I was just going

00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,300
to explain you know especially from a

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,709
new zealand perspective because some of

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,389
these things seems a lot different than

00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:30,519
what was being mentioned that i was gone

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:35,500
as to why we would open source our

00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:37,000
product so one of the key things about

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,870
being a new zealand's do very far away

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,130
from anywhere and it's quite hard to get

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,110
the rest of the world to learn about you

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,420
but it's also incredibly crucial because

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,760
you quickly saturate the market place

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,209
right it's it's the same size as an

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,889
American city so you know one of the key

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,040
things that we established about a year

00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:58,600
ago it was the fact that well we needed

00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,980
to advertise and get a whole lot of

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,370
people on board that was what we wanted

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,959
to do so if we actually advertise I

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,459
guess with the product itself rather

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,810
than trying to bash even over the head

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,579
with a baseball bat in terms of some

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,930
promotions and billboards then that's

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,699
going to be really really positive it's

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,660
going to be a lot cheaper people are

00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,180
actually going to like what we've

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,320
produced innately rather than just enjoy

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,240
our marketing campaign and yeah so it

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,709
just really made sense that I guess as a

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,290
channel to market that we should open

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:31,600
source the whole product another part to

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,940
it is that you know the whole tool set

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,100
that we created was the result of our

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,290
everyday work we didn't go off and

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,000
decide to come up with some imaginary

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,160
problem and in trying to solve it in

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,920
market that we've produced a couple

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,870
hundred websites and every time we build

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,130
a site we would kind of stubble toe on

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,110
some problem would be kind of too

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,630
complex to make a design in this way or

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,300
too much time to create a database in

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:59,050
this way or something like that and so

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,839
over time we made a toolkit and so I

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,149
guess you know what we had a few years

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,660
ago was not worlds apart from what we

00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:10,480
have today and you know so in back in

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,339
2004 Tim the CEO of civil strife and

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,769
myself we went around knocking on doors

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,690
ok I've built this beautiful toolkit

00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,779
with my 100 sites in it you should buy

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,310
an office and the feedback was very very

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,690
positive as we've got very excited and

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,069
come home from you know from where it

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,690
can be very excited at all this positive

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:28,120
buzz people wanted to use a product they

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,649
wanted to learn all about it but they

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,610
basically didn't want to give us any

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,170
money for it

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,880
that caused us a problem and it really

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,890
confused us because people would be

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,839
saying looking us in the eyes and saying

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,860
that they love the product but they

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,880
wouldn't give you all about it now it

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,880
just completely contradicting themselves

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,470
and so the problem was not so much the

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,510
product samples and the spark that was

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,800
what was around them and specifically

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,019
for silverstripe it was the problem

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,870
about the licensing structure and the

00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:58,029
cost so the cost you know if you're

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,320
making websites or web developers we've

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:00,690
developers are generally very shrewd

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,769
they don't want a part of a lot of money

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,079
they used to a whole lot of free tools

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,300
being available so they didn't see the

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,620
reason to spend money on at all even if

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,880
it was a lot better than the free ones

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,410
out there secondly they also we use to

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,390
the freedom there are open source

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,100
provides in terms of things like PHP and

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,420
HTML and JavaScript you can always just

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,589
look at what everyone else has built in

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,850
terms of the sites you can rip it apart

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:27,010
you can just have a field day and so for

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,420
us to try and make money offers and kind

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:33,970
of lock it down and also just didn't

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:35,470
work with them another aspect of you

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,850
know why we decided to kind of destroyed

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,220
us this whole grain was you know we were

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,370
indeed so i've been using open source

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,019
software since i buy more than 10 years

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,980
ago I tried to keep quite pointing on my

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:49,600
4x6 so I could track people and everyone

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,790
else had pentium so it was fine for them

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,060
but I my Microsoft box just didn't

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,100
didn't play well so and trying to get

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,329
quite running on my machine idea for had

00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,589
to learn anything about linux I already

00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,519
knew how to do some programming and

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,800
already loves you internet and stuff

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,630
like that so I now had you know

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,790
experience and internet and and Linux

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:13,360
and you know so it's all just kind of

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,670
gel together it just naturally was a

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,260
really nice a key set of tools for us to

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,240
found the company and to put our

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,690
experience than to and after several

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,660
years of using all of this software we

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,130
really felt that we were just you know

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,269
taking all of this food away from the

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,800
suit picture and they're not kind of

00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,510
giving anything back to community so

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,060
silverstripe was a nice way of giving

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:39,339
back another aspect of it was this whole

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,069
notion of Ireland so I went on this it's

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,840
quite cool road trip with my dad and

00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:45,460
their knows way too much about violent

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,740
so one of the interesting things was as

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,600
wonderful analogy that we formulated

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,840
between violin making and open source

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,020
software and basically up to about

00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,870
eighteen hundreds all the violins being

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,090
created we're doing were basically

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,030
created out of a guild kind of system so

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,830
and have a master and a princess BB

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,390
working very collaboratively but the

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,480
same time competing for commissions

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:14,440
right after the 1800s there was

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,510
ferocious you know it became very very

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,050
popular and so there was a very very

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,130
strong desires for the companies and so

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,440
on to produce these and it has

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,430
commoditized and so the quality vent

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,720
really we're down because they were

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,000
competing completely rather than

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,520
collaborating and so if you ask a lot of

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,460
the you know major violin itself today

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,530
now most of them are trying to still get

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,270
instruments pre 1800 it's only more

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,640
recently that people have been beginning

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,290
to collaborate again after realizing

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,380
that the commoditization on the violin

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,910
destroyed it so yeah it's a nice

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,220
reminder to us in a softer world if we

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,830
go for 150 years just competing too much

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:56,500
will basically have this kind of nuclear

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:58,030
cold winds real software so I've already

00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,980
talked a bit about the freedom so some

00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,080
of the surprises well we didn't buy Liv

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,670
Tyler and all of this but we did get

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,010
some very satisfied staff I think that

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,330
was one of the really nice things I mean

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,160
you'll appreciate this a google as well

00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,200
you know when we were just making

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,180
websites for people it was difficult for

00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,980
the junior staff for most staff to

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,640
really get lots of nice little bits of

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,020
praise now that we're open source people

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,670
can just make patches that's very clear

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,830
what people are doing and for instance

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,180
we've got a guy who's soldiers in as

00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,310
University he spread most of the

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,720
tutorials for silver stripe and everyone

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,920
that has downloaded Silver's fight goes

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,200
through his tutorials and so he gets

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,110
lots of praise and so that's a really

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,790
really nice situation to be in as I

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,140
mentioned you know just not a lot of

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,880
open source stuff going on in New

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,180
Zealand and so it was quite novel and so

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,680
we've got a lot of TV radio newspaper

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,870
advertising basically you know promotion

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,050
and so that tight greatly until our a

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,840
whole desire for open source to work

00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,220
with us and actually promote the company

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,840
and yeah I mean we've been invited to

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,659
ask Karl and here today you know

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,679
it's been really really cool all right

00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:05,470
so i'll talk a wee bit about some of the

00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,789
things that we've learned in terms of

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,659
managing people on an open source

00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:11,590
project firstly one of the things i

00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:14,460
seriously recommend to everyone that's

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,870
involved an open source is this Bible

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,659
speical vola understand it actually

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,600
Leslie was parading him around here just

00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:25,299
quite recently but I basically read his

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,120
book online which was producing OSS com

00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:29,740
in about 24 hours it was fantastic there

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,529
was nothing I disagreed with it was all

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,779
just beautiful so I hope that he

00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,399
continues to keep it updated you know as

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:42,220
years go by it's it's really really

00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:43,840
great okay so one of the big challenges

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,779
we had was that we didn't have a

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,250
definitive roadmap right a lot of open

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,110
source projects are like this you have

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,690
some ideas and desires if a big to-do

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,919
list but you don't have you know kind of

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,370
course a one quarter to quarter 3

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,340
roadmap explaining intimately what's

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,720
going to be done each time so one of the

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,340
things that we would found worked really

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,890
really well was basically just

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,490
publishing some guiding principles so

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:12,220
what I mean by that is there were things

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,690
that we already felt were very true but

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,929
we just hadn't for whatever reason

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,600
articulated them and as the other

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,340
developers and contributors found out

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,159
these things that worked very well so

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,289
for instance someone a google Summer of

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,320
Code students started introducing fairly

00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:32,830
technical fields and ideas into the CMS

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,960
in terms of the interface and so I put a

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,520
place to now for and saying okay well

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,690
one of the big things we wanted to do

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,340
with this emius let's make it very

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,460
simple for a communications and

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,200
marketing person not a developer to use

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,789
a CMS and so some of these sorts of

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,520
guiding principles very useful to

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:50,440
publish their in lieu of a roadmap and

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,320
so they should be the differentiators of

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,200
your project they should be basically

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,720
two reasons that your product is in

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,279
existence right as why as white as your

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,260
point different why is it solving a

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,230
business paying you and so you don't

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,389
need to be incredibly detailed and spell

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,919
every tile it will detail out for

00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,539
you know people contributing on the

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,759
project if you kind of give them these

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,940
major kind of guidelines as to where to

00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,929
be and a point you know like these

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,669
things should exist already you

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,579
shouldn't just go ah ok well what will

00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:22,989
these be like you should already have

00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,029
aspects about your project that are

00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:27,669
already the reason that people are

00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,959
choosing that right so you really just

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:35,459
articulate and stuff that already exists

00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:35,459
another big thing as giving recognition

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,379
and in general I'm talking about doing

00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:42,249
it in public you know if I say to you

00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:44,349
hey look you've done a really really

00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:46,149
good job just to you personally and

00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:47,559
confided in you you know you might smile

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:49,059
and that might be great but if I say to

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,259
a whole group of people will put on a

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,320
mailing list or something like that that

00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,789
this person has done a fantastic job

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,379
then he realizes that I kind of just

00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,209
said that to everyone else and then it's

00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:59,589
actually quite a real treat then that i

00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:01,450
actually do appreciate it and things

00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:04,629
like that and so that's a really really

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,719
nice reward for contributing and helping

00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:10,719
someone along it's also can be used as a

00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:13,659
motivator right but you do need to be

00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:15,489
specific about what the praise are so

00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,829
involved and just saying hey look you

00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:19,539
know thanks to Hayden you know you

00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,129
should say specifically kind of what the

00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,509
work wise and why it was useful and

00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:25,299
things like that so people kind of know

00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:28,719
what it was what they can replicate and

00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:30,159
get more praise or let's say you know

00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,179
very dear to our heart of google Summer

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,429
of Code you might have a bunch of people

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,019
who are working fantastically and then

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:37,479
you could have a couple people who just

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,399
kind of need to be pushed along and so

00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:41,559
if you've got some specific praise and

00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:43,059
you're giving recognition to a bunch of

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,029
people then the people who are not

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,769
really you know contributing as much as

00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:49,419
they should be kind of look over there

00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,769
and go all right well I can see exactly

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:52,779
what these people have done I can see

00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,039
exactly what they've been praised for I

00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:56,519
just needs em like that and then I'm

00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,839
going to be in that hole tight as well

00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,979
and I guess just another point there is

00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,999
you know just just make sure you're

00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:02,379
balanced all right it's kind of like

00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:04,989
raising kids you know you don't want to

00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:06,639
say you know great you've done a good

00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:09,190
job everything because in it dilutes it

00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:11,229
but at the same time you do need to say

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,940
it enough otherwise they just get the

00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:15,179
priests that i just leave and they ever

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,179
sir

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,630
another point and this is this is quite

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,930
specific google summer of code as well

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,400
it's just how we delegate at work so

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,200
this was just a balance between saying

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,870
hey let you guys go off and just build

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,460
us something cool vs. my kids

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,310
micromanagement and coming up with this

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,380
really detailed plan and in every day

00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,120
being to evolve so what worked for us

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,750
really well was that I specifically

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,880
created a one-page overview of what the

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,920
project should be like and I did that in

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,450
collaboration with the students so that

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,460
I didn't just go here go this is what

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,560
you're doing so it was still a a

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,450
collective activity but the point is is

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,870
that it fitted on a page that's about

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,980
the amount of detail that was in this

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:03,650
what sort of a to three-month project

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,120
the other s bit there is that because

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,620
it's an open source project you can't

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,240
rely on one person answering these

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,050
questions so that the students are going

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,790
to always have lots of questions

00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,090
especially at the start switch it end

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:17,030
and it's too much to ask of one person

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,990
to answer all the data that question so

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,790
we tried to throw it out to the

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,560
community set up a forum or some kind of

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,300
activities so that all of these

00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,100
questions get funneled to a group of

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,460
people who can then respond and so on

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,070
and so it might mean that the answer is

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,860
not absolutely accurate or you know that

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,300
kind of thing straight away but as an

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,790
average it's going to work far better

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,920
than let's say saying well if all Horace

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,840
wants to go to this one person and that

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,560
person is busy for a week then you know

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,690
what happens you know and as I mentioned

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,220
you know like there was just one page

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,050
but then if we kind of add some of these

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,810
guiding principles such as you know the

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,530
product is designed so that the you know

00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,430
the CMS is only really their full site

00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,420
manager it's not really there for the

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,590
developer you know if you have some of

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,260
those kind of bullet points that are

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,090
global so the whole project then people

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,470
when they're doing their code they kind

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:11,360
of know what the parameters are that

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:13,040
they were trying to work within so yeah

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,210
Leslie likes to talk about hurting a lot

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,260
so I thought I could have a little

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,610
mental hurting slide again one of the

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,470
things that we really tried to do is

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,870
just take the work often right so like

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,000
try and get them to do

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,550
you know the smallest amount but the

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,020
greatest amount that they can so if

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,360
there's someone that just knows a

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,680
fantastic amount about databases will

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,330
doing great so like if you've got a

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,010
database abstraction layer or something

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,720
you're trying to create well then these

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,960
people should be married together but

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,700
try and get you know the very tough

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,280
challenging questions to rector that's

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,650
mentor and then just everything else try

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,300
and spread that out because this person

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,680
as mentor is going to be very important

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,880
to the organization that they're working

00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,880
for whatever they can have a very small

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,410
amount of time so if they are doing any

00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,790
mentoring you want to make sure that

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,230
they are completely and one hundred

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,929
percent the most suitable person for

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,520
answering that question and they're just

00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,410
you know they're not just answering

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,760
silly questions like setting up email or

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,580
anything like that all that stuff is to

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,200
be pushed off them another point about

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,880
the mentoring is that you know try and

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,520
actually get them to have a lot of fun

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,830
right so I tried to make sure that the

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,270
mentors we're working on projects that

00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,120
they were interested in so that when the

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,710
project's finished they would go great

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,470
well I made this really cool thing and

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,350
it's dear to my heart and it also just

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,820
meant that it was easy to give praise

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,929
because they were interested in it and

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,640
dip thought I'd be doing a whole lot of

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:37,340
cool stuff and you know so it just made

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,750
this life synergy so it's important not

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,110
just to concentrate on students having a

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:45,250
good time but also that mean to us all

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,250
right so a little bit about mistakes

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:50,629
so the mistakes and I'm really kind of

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,690
talking about relate to the design

00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:55,460
process of our application so you know

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,219
the biggest thing for us was that we

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,839
were building sites we knew of a problem

00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,960
and we are trying to fix that so we knew

00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,190
one of the issues were we weren't really

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,919
trying to go out on a limb and just

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,570
trying to fix issues that didn't exist

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,089
you know it all ties back to pull grabs

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:15,080
ya fix problems people have or whatever

00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:18,409
letters you know so the other the big

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,239
thing for us was that we would spend a

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:21,589
lot of time carefully going well how

00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:23,749
should we implement this feature how

00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:25,609
should we make it reusable how should we

00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:28,759
make it fast or whatever the parameters

00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:30,739
were and too soon degree you certainly

00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,049
do need to think those through but you

00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:34,580
also have to expect that after a couple

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,070
of years all of these great decisions

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,690
you've made in aggregate will still end

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,539
you up with a system that is a bit of a

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,129
throwaway right just because software

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,710
moves so quickly there's always new ways

00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:46,879
of doing things and so while day-to-day

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,710
always making really really smart

00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:51,320
decisions over the course of several

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,639
years you will have made a product that

00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,979
basically has reached the end of its

00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:56,799
lifetime and you need to start again but

00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:59,450
importantly you have actually

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,609
accumulated a wealth of information so

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,469
for us back in two thousand five after

00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,749
five years of making a sort of first

00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:07,309
toolkit we had an immense amount of

00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,200
information so that we would produce a

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,759
second version of it and when we also

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,809
looked at the other mistakes and issues

00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,179
and things that were out in the

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:16,960
marketplace we could produce a much much

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,960
better system

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,309
alright well i thought i would show you

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,600
some of the stuff that has gone into

00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,600
google Summer of Code

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,440
alright so the first guy was going to

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,570
talk about was lux and pereira he is

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,050
from Sri Lanka he's been doing the whole

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,670
inner cool stuff of mashups and so at

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,070
the start of his project we talked about

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,290
making it really nice and easy for

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,940
things like Flickr and YouTube and

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:57,140
technorati all those kind of web

00:27:52,940 --> 00:28:01,400
services try to get that content playing

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,780
around and into the system and so about

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,050
half way through the whole project so

00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,210
well I can show you things that are now

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,400
currently working so at the moment you

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,890
can easily add a gallery of flickr

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,230
photos your site you can download this

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:20,420
code so debt is showing the riley oz

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:23,660
cotton stuff you can do the same thing

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,730
for technorati and so in the second half

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,250
the project that's more a case of doing

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,630
the same thing with youtube and then

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,950
just tighten up and boxing it up

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,720
together properly so you can download

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,150
the source code and have this stuff

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,650
playing on at the moment but it's still

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,400
a little bit more work to get it to a

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:43,070
one point I kind of status another point

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,410
about you know our project is the fact

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,550
that we listened very hard to what

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,960
people want so one of the bigger

00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,170
surprises we had something that we

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,350
didn't really have on our road map was

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:57,710
internationalisation right but it was

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,060
definitely the most concentrated single

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,730
request so you know like it wasn't

00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,260
necessarily the majority of requests but

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,870
if we kind of tallied all the pieces

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,160
together that would be the biggest lump

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:09,290
and so it was clear to us that we need

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,880
to get someone working on this so we've

00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,340
now got silver straight running and

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,750
Spanish there so the

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,330
internationalisation stuff is

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,070
interesting because one you have to make

00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,720
it update all the labels and that kind

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,300
of stuff but then you also need a system

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,890
to manage it so let's say you know like

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,590
one of the other projects is going to

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,940
add a new feature to rotate images so

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,260
let's say that we've translated six

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,330
languages but didn't add this extra

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,760
feature we now have to go back through

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,940
the languages and actually add rotate

00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,160
image and successful languages so you

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,600
need a nice system to be able to handle

00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,370
there and you want preferably assistant

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,820
a technical person isn't utilizing that

00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:49,460
someone that just knows these languages

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:52,690
so yeah we've got the google Summer of

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,690
Code student working on by for those

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,110
we've also got some quite cool stuff

00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,390
happening with usability we had Elijah

00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:02,210
from Alabama we actually meet up with

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,380
him and Portland which was really great

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,810
because we'd never met any of these

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:10,520
people and you know we've come up some

00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,480
some quite nice ideas here and I think

00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,040
you know a lot of these sorts of things

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,360
you know I really want to openly share

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,610
because I'd like to see some of these

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,330
things incorporate into other

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:21,950
applications so one of the things we've

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,650
got here is you know drag and drop file

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,120
manipulation so by the way silver

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,280
stripes all under the bsd license so you

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,390
can download this stuff and copy it and

00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,010
use it you know we want the whole

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:36,110
Webster to be bitter so different do

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:37,580
that and then we've also got the whole

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,220
kind of notion that see how it's red

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,510
background on the buttons so like if

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,920
you're about to do an action that could

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,260
potentially be a little dangerous tin

00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,700
sort of leaving the user note softly and

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,590
it's the same kind of way up like you

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,990
know if you're getting a a cup of coffee

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,730
out of a microwave it's steaming right

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,870
so you know that maybe you should sort

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,760
of exercise a little bit of caution

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,430
about touching the object you're not

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,720
going to be kind of prompted to go do

00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,210
you really want to touch the coffee is

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,630
hot you know so try to provide subtle

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:09,340
cues so that you don't add obstacles but

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,340
just kind of insight into the actions

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,240
I'm sure leaves you like this one this

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,600
one's all about google adwords and

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,950
sitemaps so this is a guy who we also

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,300
met will stop from seattle and so

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,940
basically we were just integrating the

00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,300
system so that you can type a frazen in

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,710
to go into silver stripe and it just

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,890
integrates very nicely so the page that

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,750
you're editing will be featured as a

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,190
google adword and just just kind of

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,110
simplified the process so that you don't

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,060
have to be in one application India

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:47,780
Hawaii and back and forth no try and get

00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:50,450
it in the same place we also had an

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,800
interesting project web google maps and

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,230
so i really wanted to know what the

00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,430
community of silver stripe look like and

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,900
I thought that does would be something

00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,280
that

00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,290
it's communities what also like to know

00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,940
so if you've got a forum you want the

00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,470
people who are signing up to the forum

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,470
to indicate where they are and then you

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:11,020
see a geographical representation of

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:15,180
them fortunately I've actually got the

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,180
open ID screenshots showing that there

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,220
another approach that we were doing was

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:27,250
all about p do which was silverstripe

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,600
work with my sequel but we wanted to get

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,370
to work with all our other different

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,350
things with different databases slope

00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,720
post grades like microsoft sequel server

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,540
and stuff like that and so Philippe was

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,920
working for the last six weeks basically

00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,600
evaluating all the different database

00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,260
abstraction frameworks out there that

00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,070
are available to PHP and so we chose the

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,570
PHP data objects and in the second half

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,920
of the project he's actually cutting it

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,920
up so that's really awesome to see

00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,440
another part of the system and this

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,480
again as you know what you should be

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,510
doing I feel you know the bane of

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,070
usability with open source projects is

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,110
the usability generally right there's

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,710
the problem now the whole Linux desktop

00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:14,470
has suffered and in manipulating our own

00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,360
site I found that I was often having to

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,070
manipulate a photo outside of the

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,130
application I wanted to be a ting crop

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,170
within the application and so as part of

00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,710
streamlining some of the general use

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,870
cases on substrate we've got mateus from

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,000
Poland to do that and then choose

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,490
something you know like one of the great

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,540
conversations I had were Mateus was the

00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,310
fact that you know the four and a half

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,440
grand that he got for that actually was

00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,730
equivalent to a whole year's salary in

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,120
Poland you know it was still is very

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,120
marvelous

00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:52,250
so then we had another American that was

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:56,550
Quinn he was doing on reporting stuff so

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:58,230
we were using a bunch of non flash or

00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,300
image compositing components to produce

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,600
a whole lot of nice graphical reporting

00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,550
systems and silver strap because

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,790
basically we wanted to make it so that

00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:11,070
if you had some data in a system you

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,720
know you basically a forum in you and

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,270
your website and you wanted to know how

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,250
much the membership was growing or

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,149
something like that you wanted to be

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,710
able to just we'll have a couple of

00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:21,149
lines of code to actually produce a

00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,040
graph you just want to test a wall up

00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:24,450
here's a here's a single query or here's

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:32,040
some objects or you know something like

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:33,690
that and so that's what Quinn's up to we

00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,169
also appreciate the fact that Apple has

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,850
come out of a new browser as Pasiphae

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,909
version 3 because it fixed up a lot of

00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:43,470
JavaScript and HTML and CSS problems and

00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:47,159
so silver strike was fundamentally we're

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,720
now working with Safari 3 as it now does

00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,070
with a lot of other you know we have

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,409
applications that are quite rich and

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,179
Ajax and things like that so we've got

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:57,660
Meg here just working through holidays

00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,270
HTML CSS JavaScript issues that remain

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,850
and so at the end of her project at all

00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,250
now work in IE and firefox and safari

00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:13,200
and if we're lucky you perhaps even

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:15,990
opera alright so we've got markers from

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,160
italy and he's been working on open ID

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,490
and this is something which i'm really

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,500
really excited about Ashley because one

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,120
of the ponds we had was the fact that we

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,950
would be trying to log in and administer

00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,260
hundreds of websites you know on behalf

00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,880
of our clients and so if we had

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,470
usernames and passwords that we've

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,970
manually set up well then sometimes

00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,400
that'd be different with a new staff

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,520
member came on or left they suddenly had

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,070
access just to way too much or you know

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,860
other sites and so on so with open ID we

00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:45,240
can basically say all of you sites

00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,830
there's a single log on for

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,260
administrative access all of those and

00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,180
if one of our staff members leave then

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,120
we can just change the password of our

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,920
open I the account and so the existing

00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,300
staff can now login and celeb exes what

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,670
the person is left now

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,440
longer does and it can also be applied

00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,180
to several different layers of exit so

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,040
you might have an open ID for

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,900
administrative or just normal site

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,750
content management so as of now you can

00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,060
log into the administrating system with

00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,400
open ID and by the end of the project

00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,720
you will be able to use open ID to

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,760
silence or a forum and stuff like that

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,300
using silver stripes so if you have a

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,680
silicone powered forum you don't have to

00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,240
mindlessly type in all of your usernames

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,010
and passwords on your date of birth

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,290
whatever else that the site owner wants

00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,910
user pass over you can just say hey I've

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,890
got an open ID account just suck all

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,180
that information and to an account and

00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,760
that's really good because I must have

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,350
over 100 places where i've typed in and

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,600
signed up and register four fingers and

00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,460
so I'm looking forward over the next 12

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,860
months to a world with a lot more sites

00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,000
are using open ID so I don't have to

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:57,150
keep on providing that information who

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,460
hosts what alright so open idea is a

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:04,020
distributed against authentication

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:06,600
system and so basically there are two

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,090
things there are providers or I guess

00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,470
kind of like directories of usernames

00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,960
and passwords I guess if you want to

00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,610
think of it like that and then you have

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,460
a whole lot of sites or systems that

00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:21,600
want you know I guess want permission

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,820
from users to gain access and so in this

00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,440
example here I've got my open ID com so

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,440
there are free places where you can just

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,750
sign up for an account and then

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,160
basically you type in your URL so

00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,750
another like an email address right like

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,510
the front bit says well this is my

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,830
username in the last but essentially

00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,070
kind of sale where should I go off and

00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,900
authenticate and I guess it could be a

00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:45,450
little bit like you know with with

00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,670
Google you have the Google accounts so I

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,400
could say that I've got an ebay store

00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,230
and so long as you know if I'm logging

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,490
into ebay so long as I can kind of get

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,500
it to authenticate into the google

00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,180
account then i'm allowed into ebay it's

00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,370
the same thing except they're the

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,300
provider of the authentication mechanism

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,300
is completely open

00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,920
alright and so those are actually 13

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,240
projects that we've been working on some

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,359
of the lessons that we've learned so far

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,040
I think we've been pretty lucky with the

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,790
students that we put but I think one of

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,010
the main reasons that that's true is I

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,200
had a very soon the requirement that

00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,910
they all had to give me code and that

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,599
the code they gave me all had to fulfill

00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:32,130
the same request so basically I asked

00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,170
them to make a browser poll you know

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,630
what's your favorite browser so i had to

00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,890
basically ask some questions in HTML

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,290
ahead to have a little bit of JavaScript

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:42,810
validation and there had to be an HTML

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:47,310
and CSS that was compliant I had to be

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:48,720
in PHP it had to you know tell the

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,400
person to put the information to my

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,839
sequel database so it was kind of late

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,670
you know ID 100 different things you

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,650
wanted to know about this developer and

00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,420
I just asked a very trivial question

00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,010
about all of them so that I could for

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,770
instance see well this guy has just made

00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,630
beautiful of your own to php5 code but

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,270
the design is appalling okay well let's

00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:09,750
get him to do something in the back end

00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:11,609
or this guy you know say like Quinn had

00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,349
like just blew me away of all of these

00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:14,880
graphs so I was just totally taken aback

00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:15,990
well we just have to get them to do

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,270
something with graphing this is just

00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,920
incredible so it really just kind of

00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,930
solicited the strengths and weaknesses

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,300
so I could match them up with a good

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,560
project and ultimately let you know

00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,950
indicate where a lot they should be in

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,390
the program at all and so that's kind of

00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,930
we have a good projects thing so trying

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,040
to match skills and stuff like that one

00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,670
of the things that is quite challenging

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,589
the moment for us as the problem with

00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,970
interdependencies so if she got you know

00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:44,160
like we've got a guy who was working on

00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,810
google maps and i'll open ID and stuff

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,060
so if we wanted to even kind of start

00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,349
getting these things to work together

00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,790
these are interdependency problems i

00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,520
think in general you try and keep them

00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,380
separate so that if someone doesn't you

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,569
know participate properly or slow

00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,619
something it's not gonna have an adverse

00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:03,000
effect on anyone else point that you

00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,530
know liz is my time time again it's all

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,660
about you know just starting the coding

00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,730
early and I think you know for the

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,880
opportunity to dust again then you know

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,920
we're going to make that very very clear

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,420
because you can always sort of slack off

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,070
but it's very hard to kind of catch

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,119
and I think you know on that note you

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,250
know one of the good things we've done

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,130
you know like probably about fifty

00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,230
percent of the projects which I'm

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,460
showing you've got half of them they've

00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,710
actually got quite available for

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,780
download now and so we made a fairly

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:36,060
kind of arbitrary choice about which one

00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,770
was in or not but basically wanted to

00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,970
get some of it out the door so that we

00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,619
could find out some of the problems

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,970
straightaway it would have been

00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,800
unmanageable if we tried to release

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,869
everything and sort of 0.1 release

00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,720
straight away but at the same time it

00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:49,980
would have been really bad to try and

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,630
get everything so called kind of rock

00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,910
solid and then release it because then

00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,500
we wouldn't have learnt on a problem so

00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,859
for instance we needed to make some code

00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,359
available so that a module Penta ticket

00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,589
of another module exists that kind of

00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,589
thing so they're all internal technical

00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:06,359
things that kind of popped up through

00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:08,720
door releasing the code early and you

00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,890
know so it was quite healthy to do that

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,089
yeah and lastly you know it was just

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,260
really really exciting those reels

00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:15,089
really really cool to have all of these

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,650
people just completely transform our

00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:23,190
project and just make it twice as good

00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:25,349
as it's what it was so yeah if you've

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,180
got questions it has to stay away from

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,280
our sports because I don't know that

00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,869
other than the fact that when I am flew

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,530
over on the plane you know it's watching

00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:37,410
a movie and every kind of 30 minutes the

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,330
pilot would pause all the communications

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,760
and everything like that and it's a hey

00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,680
look you know the school is like five

00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,180
million taevon know a game was on but I

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,160
definitely need to gain was I'll after

00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,020
my movie was interrupted six times so we

00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,070
didn't win a rugby game recently I don't

00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:56,910
know even know what it was but yeah the

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:59,460
other questions about the kiss fact new

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,070
zealand about silver strife about

00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:06,750
managing open-source teams or code and

00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:08,849
stuff like that he's the bills now that

00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,740
you've open source the product all right

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:13,859
so who pays our bills well as I her

00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,480
mentioned initially what we were doing

00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,460
up to about a year ago we were closed

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,450
source and so we were building websites

00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,770
or people right and so even today that

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,080
you know to this day that's still true

00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,790
but is it gets two categories there are

00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,180
people who are downloading our free tool

00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:31,220
and maybe one able to support orbit

00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,470
just wanting a whole site being built or

00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,119
that kind of thing and then you know

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,430
there are more local customers back in

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,470
Wellington who want websites right so

00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,109
one instance the capital city so you

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,700
have small business large business and

00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:45,559
in you have government so you've got a

00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,880
nice diversity of people who don't know

00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,609
anything about websites but need

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,410
websites so that's that's paying our

00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,760
bills dignity in the short term one of

00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,050
the big things we wanted to do with open

00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,540
sourcing the product was get a lot more

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:59,059
people using it and that really opened

00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,710
the door for us to cover of

00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:03,559
complementary products and services you

00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,059
know so we're looking into ways of you

00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:06,980
know for instance without free ecommerce

00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:08,869
module looking at ways I've seen well as

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,220
in ways that we can have Commission's or

00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:13,010
can we kind of Hostess and doing things

00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,569
like that where you need to part with

00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,670
money anyway as the person using the

00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:18,680
system so given that we've given the

00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,210
code to you is there a way that's fair

00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,750
and equitable for you to give us some of

00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,609
that finally you know we're also looking

00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,800
at in our other complementary products

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:30,770
that we can produce you know possibly in

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,510
a sess model and things like that so the

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,640
first stage for us really was just

00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:39,130
trying to get people to learn about us

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,130
and to love our product yeah

00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:49,190
haiyan so how widespread your customers

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,920
in the game come on Smith how yeah you

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,540
mentioned a lot of local customers yer

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,430
open source you're on the Internet do

00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,070
you get customers that are outside your

00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,090
time zone ok well ok so the question is

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,760
you know do we have customers

00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,860
geographically dispersed so for the most

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,390
part no because for the service based

00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:09,190
business of do really building a website

00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:11,120
for people who say so technical it's

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,650
quite difficult to work in different

00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,170
time zones and cost countries when you

00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,480
can't meet face-to-face but there is

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,770
changing in terms of the developer

00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,210
community so we're getting lots of

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:24,290
inquiries like I was just answering the

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:26,000
phone useless some guy down the Florida

00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,770
was ringing up as I look I've seen your

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,080
whole tool i want you know you said kind

00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,880
of be a partnership of me so that you

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,140
know i can kind of fire you the

00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,610
difficult questions and so on right

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,380
there other than America there's not a

00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:42,380
lot of interest and I think that's just

00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,640
sort of representative of you know I

00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,810
guess the American economy in terms of

00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,900
you know like this a lot of it IT

00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:50,810
industry is and stuff I there but I mean

00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,490
we've had you know over 15,000 downloads

00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:55,940
and lots of people actually being

00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:59,810
self-sufficient than using at all I said

00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,280
it's probably my tears more of a nice

00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,840
positive comment on the documentation

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,740
and stuff like they're in the forum and

00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:08,090
IRC and things yeah but I mean I think

00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,710
one of the points are so it's still

00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,360
fairly early days right because it's

00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:15,320
very was when we made the state will

00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:17,810
release so that's what six months as

00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,460
it's the first of all this now so yeah

00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,020
so I mean you know I think that it's

00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,960
definitely growing but people wanting to

00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:25,700
use it and play around with a lot more

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,100
and I mean we've had steady growth to

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:34,030
the traffic and stuff like that so it's

00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:34,030
definitely working here easily

00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:45,440
same time up you can you can you can

00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:47,960
join us for the QA hi everyone for

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,480
seeking delay and now I'm on so so Sam

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,700
is the CTO still straight he is the

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,700
brainchild behind a little code so while

00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:58,940
I actually showed him the PHP language

00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,140
just on its cus from three to four it

00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,660
doesn't take many years for him to

00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:04,220
completely supersede my abilities and

00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:07,010
stuff like that so I've had so kind of

00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:13,340
bowel downs as his godlike stay true and

00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:14,930
that regard for the introduction we've

00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:19,610
got any perhaps technical questions

00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:22,910
about I don't know I mean Sam Center to

00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,680
talk it asked on on ending rails envy

00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,660
and php5 so I don't know if there's

00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:34,180
anyone out there wants to to know about

00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:36,830
that but we've stopped all right so

00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:39,470
another thing that I'm involved in in

00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:43,910
New Zealand is an outfit called web sock

00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:45,470
so there are about five or six of us who

00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,810
have spearheaded this whole web

00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:51,140
standards movement in New Zealand and we

00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:52,730
put on a conference about two years ago

00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,950
and there's another one coming early

00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:57,800
next year in New Zealand and the focus

00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:01,400
is very much on web standards about

00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,320
making elegantly engineered websites so

00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,150
yeah we brought a whole other people

00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,890
like Doug Bowman and calico so and

00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,810
things like that to our country and

00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,120
basically created the first major web

00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:14,540
conference in New Zealand and it was a

00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,630
lot of fun I was very motivating very

00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,610
inspirational for everyone that turns up

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:23,450
and I basically kind of encourage anyone

00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:26,570
that's in a position to bring I guess

00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,920
inspiration and ideas and so on to your

00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,240
community to do so you know because

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,560
there was nothing really happening like

00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,800
that in New Zealand so it's very very

00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:36,410
good for us to basically say hell up

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,840
well instead of just looking at blogs

00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,160
and so on and reading books about how to

00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,110
make better web sites that are

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,720
accessible or you know that kind of

00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:45,500
stuff let's actually get you in the same

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,090
room

00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,980
you know the experts and soft like that

00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,930
one of the interesting things about

00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,120
working on this kind of stuff in New

00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:56,120
Zealand is the development communities

00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,310
is pretty small and tight-knit and so if

00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,860
you start something it's quite easy to

00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:02,450
really get everybody you know in say you

00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,920
know Wellington or New Zealand excited

00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,470
about it and get everybody really on

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,120
board and so rather than just being yet

00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:11,600
another conference it's like the

00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:17,930
conference this year and debt that does

00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:23,740
have a lot of benefits yeah yeah yeah we

00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:25,670
got we got feedback from kc sierra about

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,380
about the fact that we actually made a

00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,990
different size of girls and stuff like

00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,230
that so i think there's a question at

00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,230
the back

00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:41,780
of all the can't provide relevant so we

00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,820
reset traffic Parliament or you love to

00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,830
act as their sights on YouTube yes

00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:49,370
officials about New Zealand recently

00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:52,360
passed some laws about the fact that you

00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,560
can 0 knots terrorize government I

00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,270
haven't really followed it too closely

00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,890
but my understanding is the fact that

00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,180
what the law has actually done has kind

00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:03,140
of opened it I think they were even more

00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:05,000
draconian rules that basically existed

00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,820
before the internet was around and now

00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,800
the internet exists the Lord sort of

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,570
became a bit dysfunctional and so I said

00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:16,340
well this is a bit silly let's let's try

00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:18,440
and make this a bit more sane i I don't

00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,390
know i mean the law was more targeted

00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:25,670
producers rather than consumers of

00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:27,110
content so i believe yeah if it was

00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,390
produced in New Zealand and hosted

00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:32,870
offshore I'm not sure nothing about the

00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:34,160
details but you know it's not China yeah

00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:37,310
I think I think I think in general

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,740
effect that as a country and as an

00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:43,990
economy we we don't really care too much

00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:46,100
about that so you would have to be quite

00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:49,010
slanderous and probably quite

00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,900
unjustified and and really kind of gets

00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:53,720
cause deformation for probably to really

00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,100
be invoked I don't think just making a

00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,940
bit of a mockery been a politician which

00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:03,790
happens if we split second would really

00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:03,790
really close too much alone thanks

00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,240
well we'd love to be part of the program

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:14,170
again next year has been really great

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:17,140
I'd say that we're looking really to

00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,330
grow the CMS into more of a framework

00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:23,380
more of a platform for a wider variety

00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:26,590
of projects and so in the nine months

00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,150
between the end of the the one session

00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,370
and the beginning of the next we'll

00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:33,190
probably be looking at ways of how can

00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:35,260
we get everyone you know kill it

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:39,550
collaborating on a platform rather than

00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,080
adding more and more features to CMS

00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,750
tool that what if we did that become

00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,660
increasingly bloated so it'll probably

00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,520
be more about getting lots and people

00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,890
involved in developing various add-on

00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,530
modules for the system because frankly

00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:55,810
you know the number of add-on modules we

00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,310
have compared to other CMS's we could

00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,110
stand to improve their so that'll

00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:01,870
probably be our phone yeah I think I

00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:03,430
think in general as well we would be

00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:05,140
looking at whatever is tappable at the

00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,880
moment you know so at the moment open

00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,950
ideas I think which i think is really

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,110
fantastic there'll be things happening

00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,700
at six or nine months that will be just

00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:16,260
fantastic to do that really haven't been

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:18,640
conceived yet so it'll be a case of

00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,260
seeing we know we're weird a product has

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,660
gone and where people you know what

00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,100
people want because we definitely want

00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,810
to make sure that you know what we're

00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:33,940
doing some people relevant at that time

00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:35,530
and to what people desire yeah this new

00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:39,070
zealand get advantage being sort of the

00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:41,110
first country on the new day I think New

00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:43,030
Zealand does give an advantage being the

00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:45,400
first country in a day we definitely a

00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:49,150
lot of tourism at the start of the year

00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,800
I think everyone flopped to to New

00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:55,900
Zealand renewals a new millennium except

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,150
i think it was cloudy the the timezone

00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:01,060
differences you have been companies who

00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:05,170
have tried to effectively work while the

00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:07,540
rest of the economic ohne me sleeping

00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:09,640
and then deliver stuff complete when

00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:13,330
they wake up the next morning and that

00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,850
had seen some success obviously you know

00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,800
it's queer

00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:17,990
or whether the disadvantages of the time

00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,840
zone difference don't outweigh that but

00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:22,280
you know people explore the

00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:29,840
opportunities given to them in

00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:31,960
interesting ways all right thanks for

00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,960
