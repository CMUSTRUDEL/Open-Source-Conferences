ABSTRACT

Multi-touch is a new way of human computer interaction, which recognizes multiple simultaneous touch points, as opposed to the standard touchscreen, which recognizes only one touch point at a time. There are many forms of natural input in order to simplify the way people interact with their PC's and devices, however with the introduction of Apple iPhone/iPod Touch, Microsoft Surface and other devices, multi-touch is becoming more and more popular. In this tech talk I will describe what is the history behind multi-touch screens, what kind of multi-touch devices are available and how do they work, focusing mostly on FTIR and DI technique. We will discuss how to receive multi-touch events in our applications using TUIO protocol and how to write multi-touch applications using just a simulator. We will look into available open source projects that can be used to operate multi-touch screens and that are being developed by Natural User Interface Group (NUI Group) community.
