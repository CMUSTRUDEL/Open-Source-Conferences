Title: Migrating Twitter's monorepo from Pants to Bazel
Publication date: 2020-11-10
Playlist: BazelCon 2020
Description: 
	"Source", Twitter's monorepo, spans almost 20 million lines of hand-crafted code and ten times as much of generated code. Most of it is Scala, but we also support Java, Python, and to a lesser extent NodeJS, Go and C/C++. Up until now, we have been using the Pants build tool to build, test and deploy services in Source. However, we are now moving to Bazel to fulfill those tasks. We explore how we approach this migration, where we are now, and how we're tackling some of the unique challenges that migrating from Pants entails.
