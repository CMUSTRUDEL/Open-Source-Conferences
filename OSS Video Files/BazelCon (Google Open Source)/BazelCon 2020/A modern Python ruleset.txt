Title: A modern Python ruleset
Publication date: 2020-11-13
Playlist: BazelCon 2020
Description: 
	Bazel's native Python rules are infamously ill-suited for Python projects of any complexity outside of Google. Dropbox's dbx_build_tools includes a pure Starlark alternative Python ruleset that handles millions of lines of Python in production. The Python rules include support for third-party PyPI dependencies (including native dependencies), BUILD file generation, and hermetic Python archives that don't depend on the system.
