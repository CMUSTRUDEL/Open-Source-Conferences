Title: Pinterest’s journey to a Bazel monorepo
Publication date: 2020-11-13
Playlist: BazelCon 2020
Description: 
	Pinterest started it's journey to Bazelization three years ago with our Cpp monorepo. Currently, we have separate Go and Cpp monorepos using Bazel. We are still migrating our Java repo to Bazel and will be starting on our Python/NodeJS repo soon. 
We are converging on a plan to have a multi language monorepo building with Bazel. Along the way to this goal we've identified a lot of open questions that need solving. How can you continually build deployment artifacts at scale using Bazel? How can you manage a single version for third party dependencies across hundreds of projects in the same WORKSPACE? How do you release versioned artifacts for Bazel in a language independent way? How much Bazel do repo contributors need to know? In this presentation, we discuss how Pinterest has answered these questions and more.
