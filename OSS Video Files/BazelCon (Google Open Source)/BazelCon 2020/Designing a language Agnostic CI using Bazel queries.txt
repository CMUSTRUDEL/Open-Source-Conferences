Title: Designing a language Agnostic CI using Bazel queries
Publication date: 2020-11-10
Playlist: BazelCon 2020
Description: 
	Okay, so your company has adopted Bazel as the build system of choice—running it in a Continuous Integration environment should just be ‘Bazel test …’ and ‘Bazel run …’ right? Not so fast! How does the pipeline determine which targets to run? How do you scale that logic to multiple repos and their pipelines? At Pinterest, we developed a tool that leverages the Bazel query language to pull together a set of targets to run a language agnostic pipeline. We go over the details of how we use Bazel in our CI system and the impact it has in our ability to run scalable, multi-language pipelines.
