Title: OSCON 2012: Ben Collins-Sussman, "How to Replace Yourself with an IRC Bot"
Publication date: 2013-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Googlers presenting at Conferences
Description: 
	Most of us are now so immersed in electronic forms of communication, that we lose perspective on how absolutely absurd the environments can be. This talk is a gentle reminder that we need to not take these media too seriously, demonstrated through a series of anecdotes about the art of trolling those who do. :-)

	00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,630
hello my name is Ben and this is my 8th

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,160
asean in a row alright so I'm going to

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,629
talk about electronic communication

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,129
because I spent a huge amount of time

00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:15,379
talking to people electronically and

00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:17,660
it's really easy to forget how strange

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,520
these mediums are and I like to remind

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,630
myself how strange they are so I'm going

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,370
to start with the Morrell's instead of

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,750
ending with them people take these

00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,640
things way too seriously they

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,350
communicate all day long and they forget

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,180
how weird it is and I like to notice

00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,680
when people cross the lines and when

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,509
they cross those lines I like to remind

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,399
them how absurd it is so it all starts

00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,289
back and I move into my college dorm

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,399
room I keep getting calls for doctor's

00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,690
appointments people trying to schedule

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,550
appointments with me it turns out

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,929
doctors office down the street has a

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,940
typo and has my phone number in there

00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:46,370
pamphlet but will they change it no they

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,679
won't not when i call them so I say fine

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,749
okay phone rings I start scheduling

00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,309
appointments for them yeah I'd love to

00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:54,229
see the triplets tomorrow at two o'clock

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,719
bring them in see you then and sure

00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,170
enough the calls stopped so that's an

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,749
example of electronic communication now

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,699
I do enjoy pretending to be other people

00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:08,030
in other forms like interactive fiction

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,590
huge fan and you know it's great to

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,969
pretend to be somebody else immersed in

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,280
another world the problem is that

00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:15,409
doesn't always understand you it gets a

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,299
little bit frustrating so I prefer to

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,399
talk with real people in the world like

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,350
IRC if you call those really people I

00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,329
think they're real people I spent five

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,369
years on an open source project every

00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,899
day hanging in IRC talking to people

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,430
coordinating people and it's fun but

00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:30,079
people seem to forget etiquette they

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,270
seem to forget that there are rules and

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,670
you know especially trolls come in and

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,960
you they try to rile you up and I find

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,090
the best solution is really to just

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,590
drown them with love and affection and

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,060
they run away screaming they looking for

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,820
argument's really they think they just

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,200
want abuse down the hall so there are

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,719
other forms of electronic communication

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,179
that we can we can use for example world

00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,090
of warcraft great game it's a little bit

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:54,500
addictive it's a little bit strange

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,000
people take it way too seriously I

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,189
played the game for a couple years I'm

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,659
like what it lightened up people so my

00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,909
three friends we rolled up three

00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,109
identical characters three women they

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,249
decided they would be cheerleaders

00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:07,280
they're going to do synchronized

00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,420
fireballs they speak in Valley speak and

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,770
people tried to get us to break

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,180
character and we wouldn't we would just

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:15,409
criticize their fashion and that would

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,030
just enrage them so that's why I got

00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:19,370
tired of World of Warcraft I went back

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,379
well you know email here's a problem the

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,150
email i have a really common last name a

00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,920
lot of Sussman's in the world usually

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,830
when people send me wrong email I just

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,269
tell them and they say no problem for

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,980
some reason this wedding planner kept

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,170
bothering me his army of servants kept

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,940
emailing me so I finally replied just

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,640
trying to scare them a little bit and

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,470
sure enough again they stop bothering me

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,489
very quickly after some fake legal

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,799
threats so again people seem to lose all

00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,230
sense of what's appropriate now let's go

00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:50,510
back to IRC I I fell in love with this

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,730
robot library that lets you create IRC

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,019
robots so I wrote a pinky bot I took all

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,970
of pinky and the brain everybody knows

00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,560
pinky in the brain and put all of pinky

00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,239
statements into the robot and it's just

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,530
a way to remind you how weird IRC is

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,349
right if you take it too seriously

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,790
here's pinky to say something strange

00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,310
speaking of weird twitter is very

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,689
strange to this is my favorite person to

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,000
follow on Twitter because when you see

00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,340
these tweets interpose with your friends

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,930
deep philosophical statements it gives

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,120
you some perspective on what what are

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,879
you doing at the computer right now ok

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,769
so back in IRC I took the pinky bot I

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,780
decided to do something useful i turned

00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,450
it into an a bot that actually moderates

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,950
a game of werewolf yes werewolf it got a

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,290
great following I was like all right you

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,720
can do useful things with IRC it's it's

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,970
kind of fun to do that so meanwhile I

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,829
was a leaving my job I had just accepted

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,090
a job at Google I was getting kinda

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,799
bored I had only a couple weeks left

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,780
sitting in IRC answering the same

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,370
questions over and over and over and I

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,470
thought well wait what if I replaced

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,030
myself with a robot with people notice

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,680
so I went and looked at one of the

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,930
things I usually say I went through the

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,209
logs and i programmed a bot to say all

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,680
the things I typically say and I even

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,659
put a pause in there to seem like I was

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,150
typing make it realistic so to test it

00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:01,700
out I put it into a chat room with Eliza

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,040
the psychotherapist now this was not

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,920
necessarily a good idea it was a very

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,659
very very boring conversation nobody was

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,360
taking charge didn't really go anywhere

00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:13,340
but you know at least it was it was

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
believable so great I decided it was

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,480
time to throw my bot into the chat room

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,729
I logged the bots in as me under the

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,109
name Sussman and I logged in anonymously

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,610
to watch I was like eight look after a

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,190
couple of days it snagged somebody was

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,509
like yes I tricked them that's hilarious

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,470
now when are they going to realize it's

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,960
a bot

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,230
and you know a week goes by and two

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,120
weeks go by and then oh it's nagged

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,560
another person alright this is so funny

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,840
now what are they going to notice that

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,340
it's just a bot and you know after after

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,640
three weeks i just gave up i just took

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,590
it down the experiment was to successful

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,880
which is depressing in a way but there

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,280
is a moral to the story here and the

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,130
moral is you are not as important as you

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,210
think you are not a unique snowflake but

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,950
more importantly you need to keep

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,780
perspective and how absurd some of these

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,370
electronic forms of communication are

00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,290
and remember that they are not a

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,880
substitute for face-to-face

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,880
communication so that is it thank you

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,880
