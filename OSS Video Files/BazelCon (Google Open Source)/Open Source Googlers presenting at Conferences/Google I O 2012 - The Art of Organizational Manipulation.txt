Title: Google I O 2012 - The Art of Organizational Manipulation
Publication date: 2013-03-14
Playlist: Open Source Googlers presenting at Conferences
Description: 
	Brian Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman

We often hear engineers lament how hard it is to get anything done inside of a big company. The trick to overcoming this is to know the right people, understand how power flows in the organization, and, most importantly, what you can get away with and when. We'll help you understand the human element of navigating companies both big and small through a series of (hopefully) amusing anecdotes.

00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:01,540
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Wow.

00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,870
Everybody's all quiet and ready to go.

00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,445
How are you guys doing today?

00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:04,880
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,400
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We got some more

00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,570
seats up here in front.

00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:07,830
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Couple of seat--

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,095
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Scattered around.

00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:08,960
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --if anybody wants to sit down.

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,180
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Wants it.

00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,546
Good.

00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Welcome to The Art of Organizational

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,200
Manipulation.

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,500
I am Bryan Fitzpatrick.

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,760
Most people call me Fitz.

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And I am Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,690
Everybody calls me Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,660
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So we are

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,620
engineering managers at Google.

00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,380
I see a lot of familiar faces in the audience--

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,760
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,650
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --which is pretty cool.

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,740
And we started the Chicago engineering office back 1,000

00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,790
years ago in 2005.

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,290
And we've been working as engineers and engineering

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,560
managers for a lot longer than that.

00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,910
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,170
And in the course of our travels, like he said, we've

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,910
gone from software engineers to management.

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,880
We've worked on a bunch of teams in Google.

00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,110
We worked in open source for many years.

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,310
And so over that period of time we've sort of developed a

00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,470
bunch of stories and experiences that we want to

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,400
share with you.

00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,330
And we've been doing that for a few years now.

00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,520
And this year we want to talk about life inside a large

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,470
corporation.

00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: As usual, we like to start our talks

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,110
also with a disclaimer.

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,990
We have a very brief one here.

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,320
And basically, the same thing that applies to all our talks,

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,440
which is that these are our opinions.

00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,350
And some of it doesn't actually apply if you're

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,540
working for morons or if you are a moron.

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,750
But our point here is that this is our opinions.

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,090
And if you don't like it, you can get your own talk.

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,200
And lastly, we think that what we're talking about here is

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,240
not the only way to do engineering.

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,400
But we think it's the most effective way to spend your

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,970
time when you're working in engineering.

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,630
It's true.

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Doing software engineering is fun

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,750
and a lot of work.

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,140
But really, if you want to be super efficient and effective,

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,100
you need to learn to work with people and with corporations.

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,640
So, that takes us to our next slide, which is that

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,850
corporations, companies, as you think about them, they are

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,600
not made out of source code.

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,970
And they're not made out of--

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Compilers.

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: compilers.

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,510
They're not made out of brick and mortar.

00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,920
They're actually made out of people.

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,170
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Companies are made entirely of people.

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,570
And people are what not only make things happen, but people

00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,210
in companies are what prevents things from happening in a lot

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,740
of cases, as well.

00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,199
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or cause things to happen.

00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,750
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Or, yeah.

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,110
Occasionally, they do cause something to happen.

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,270
But more than anything, if you're going to be an engineer

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,930
in a big company and make things happen, you need to

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,740
learn how to navigate them.

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,350
OK.

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,280
Now if you're in a small company or a start-up--

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,170
in fact, maybe we should do a quick-- how many people here

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,570
work in a company of less than 15 people?

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:27,880
OK.

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,660
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's like half the audience.

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,545
16 to 100?

00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:33,692
100 to 1,000?

00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:34,360
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There we go.

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Bigger than 1,000?

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Woh.

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,910
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, OK.

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There we go.

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,220
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: All right.

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,880
You're going to like this.

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,550
So, you're the guys who need the flashlight, a GPS, and a

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,670
big truck of bread crumbs to navigate your organization.

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,500
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right.

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: All right.

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,910
So that's a lot about what we're here to talk about.

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,440
Now, I'm aware--

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Some people--

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,560
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --that the term--

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,630
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --organizational

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,910
manipulation's a little weird.

00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's a little sensational, isn't it.

00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,120
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a little bit-- we like

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,480
sensational titles, like poisonous people,

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,670
that sort of thing.

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,210
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We could have just said a talk about

00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,400
office politics.

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,796
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:04,590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,020
But we like to call it organizational manipulation.

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,060
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You could also call it social

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,760
engineering, if you like.

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Ah.

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, there's three parts to this talk.

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,370
We're going to give away all the

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,860
surprises at the beginning.

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,630
There's three parts.

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,840
We're gonna talk about working in the ideal company, the

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,950
reality,

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,806
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just to get a nice diff there.

00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:23,780
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,940
The company that most people find themselves in at one

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,170
point or another and that we found

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,750
ourselves in in the past.

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,140
And lastly is the manipulation, which is the

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,280
awesome part.

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,940
But most companies are a blend of the ideal

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,290
and sort of the reality.

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,510
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So you get to pick and choose what

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,010
applies to your situation--

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,370
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,140
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --as we chat.

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,750
So let's start with the perfect environment.

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,320
Like, what should it be like to work in a large

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,230
corporation, right?

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,880
Let's talk about--

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,980
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: We'll make this quick because this isn't

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,640
very interesting.

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,550
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No, it's good stuff.

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,020
I like this.

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,880
So the first thing that you need to think about-- at least

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,350
what we preach in a lot of our talks-- is that management is

00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,010
a bad word.

00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,880
That really we talk about leadership, not management

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,850
Because the worst thing that managers do is they manage,

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,920
and that's--

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
stop managing, start leading.

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,040
And what it means to lead is it means you should be a

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,100
servant to your team.

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,080
If you have a good leader--

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,490
could be a manager, could be the person you report to--

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,360
their job is not to tell you how to do your job.

00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,339
Their job is to remove roadblocks and be like a

00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,970
butler to your team, make sure everyone is

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,360
efficient and happy.

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,620
And I'm sure that's exactly the way it is in your company.

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,660
But that's the ideal that we preach.

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,390
And that's what we try to

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,120
practice as managers ourselves.

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And often fail at.

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,220
That's how we learn.

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,970
So we get better at these things, I think.

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But I mean, when I first started out, the

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,710
first time I had a meeting with our CEO, at the time Eric

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,440
Schmidt, he came to Chicago.

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,390
Had this long meeting with him.

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,540
I was very nervous.

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,020
And he was asking me all these questions.

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,570
At the end of the meeting he leaned back, he said, so what

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,360
do you need?

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,550
I mean, I had done all this preparation for all these

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,370
answers to all these questions he was gonna ask me.

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,880
I had no answer for this.

00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,320
I just sort of, I'm like, what do you mean what do I need?

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,020
I'm just some dude.

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,330
You're the CEO, man.

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,250
Aren't I supposed to do everything for you?

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,570
And--

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a great question.

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a fantastic question.

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,070
And it's one that I like to ask people who work on my

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,650
teams as well.

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,980
What do you need to get your job done?

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,970
What do you need to be happier, to be more effective?

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,780
And I can guarantee you the next time I met with Eric, I

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,520
had an answer.

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,110
I had a whole laundry list of things that I needed, because

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,560
I was ready for that next time.

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But that's great in the sense that

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,390
Eric saw himself as there to help you, not grill you on

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,945
what have you done for him lately, kind of thing.

00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:28,330
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a great example of good

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,540
leadership.

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,340
So the other thing we'd like to talk about, if you're

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,530
working in this ideal company, is that as an employee you

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,725
should pursue responsibility.

00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:40,710
And what we mean by that is being able to leave your

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,000
comfort zone and do things that are interesting to you

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,220
and things that you think are best for your product, best

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,750
for your company, not necessarily asking permission.

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,220
We like to talk about seeing the forest through the trees.

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,990
Sort of novice engineers get told what to do.

00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,800
They expect to get told what to do.

00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,030
They do exactly what they're told.

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,850
Then they come back and they say, more work, please.

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,050
And in a great company where you can grow, when you have

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,410
software engineers who are growing and developing, you

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,290
have a situation where they're actually doing more than what

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,890
is asked of them.

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,940
They go out.

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,070
They not only do what was asked of them, but they come

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,990
back with a more general solution or a proposal to get

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,250
something better done, right?

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,610
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's generalization going on.

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,030
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,230
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And that should be rewarded.

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,120
And that should be encouraged.

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,050
An example is if you're a forest ranger, they send you

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,605
out in the forest to cut down the diseased tree.

00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,410
The novice forest ranger is going to go in, cut down the

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,730
diseased tree, and come back and say, I'm done sir.

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,900
But the more experienced one might come back and say, I cut

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,070
down the tree, removed all the branches and the stump and

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,740
everything.

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,090
And I found 57 other trees that have the same disease.

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,180
And they're right here in this map.

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,330
Would you like me to do something with them, as well?

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,270
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Create a plan.

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,710
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,460
It's creating a plan.

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,250
And those are the kind of people who wind up getting

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,610
more work, which is usually a good thing if you like what

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,080
you're doing.

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's the reward for work--

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,440
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The reward for good work is more work.

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,160
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,690
As long as you like the work.

00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,070
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a good thing.

00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,670
No, really.

00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,805
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: As long as you like the work, that's

00:06:58,805 --> 00:06:58,940
the reward.

00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: As long as you like the work.

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,040
But I mean, your leader's more likely to give you more

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,520
interesting things to do because it's

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,100
less work for them.

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And they trust you now.

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,360
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And they trust you now.

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:They see that you're thinking big.

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, what else happens in an ideal

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,510
corporation?

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,460
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you might question things.

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,420
You might, instead of just doing what you're told, you

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,890
might actually question something you don't think is

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,930
right or you think it's harmful or you think there's

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,720
something better you can do.

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,440
It's more of a dialogue than someone says, hey, you should

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,160
do this, and you just go ahead and do it.

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,750
It's about not being a doormat.

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,880
It's about challenging the status quo and trying to think

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,970
of better ways of making things happen.

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,920
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Absolutely.

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Part of that also is just learning to communicate well.

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,170
This is something I know that does not come

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,680
naturally to everybody.

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,765
There's that old joke about how do you know if an engineer

00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,560
is outgoing?

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: How, Ben?

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,310
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Looks at your shoes.

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:49,565
All right.

00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:50,570
Fine.

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:50,910
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Ooh, tough crowd.

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, but communication is critical on a

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,860
team when you're doing software engineering because

00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,250
you want to let your manager and your teammates know.

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,120
You want to know about your

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,960
victories, about your failures.

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,810
You want to know what your expectations are.

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,220
What do you need, right?

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,560
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Having the answer to that question

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,490
ready to go when somebody asks you instead of just sitting

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,780
there with the blinders on doing what you're told.

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,590
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And obstacles, even.

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,460
Like--

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:14,660
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,600
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Remember when your team had some issues

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,160
with legal, and they were like six weeks waiting for a

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,990
response from legal.

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,040
And Ben and I were having a cup of coffee, and it's like,

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,920
oh my God, you know, this is just killing us.

00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,480
This legal is not responding.

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,900
And I said, why didn't you tell me.

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,470
I know these people in legal.

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,330
And I got on the phone and resolved it in about an hour

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,200
and a half.

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
And that's not because I'm some amazing person.

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,250
It's just because I knew who to call and talk to politely,

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,080
let's shall we say.

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,700
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All because I

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,020
communicated with you.

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:40,850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Awesome.

00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yay communication.

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,730
So another thing that people often forget about in big

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:51,230
companies is actually is that people treat you the way that

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,500
you ask to be treated, I guess, is the way--

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,560
If you expect somebody to act a certain way, they

00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,390
often act that way.

00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:58,760
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,500
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,940
So, it's about getting your work done.

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,740
Nobody should be counting how many minutes you're at your

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,150
desk when you check in or check out.

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,660
If you get your work done, it's obvious.

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,730
If you don't get your work done, it's obvious.

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,250
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So that's what we mean by-- and it

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,630
certainly is true at Google.

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,200
One of the reasons we like working there is they treat

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,930
everybody like an adult by default.

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,090
And it's a wonderful thing.

00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,780
And that is not true of other companies I have been in.

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:21,990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,510
Well, there was a guy that came to work with us, and he

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,340
was on my team a number of years ago.

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,590
And he'd worked in industry for 20 years.

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,380
And it was his first day.

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,060
You're a little bit, like, overwhelmed.

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,470
Quarter to 5:00, he came up to me and said,

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,900
look, I'm really sorry.

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,460
I have an appointment that I couldn't move.

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,030
I've got to go.

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,680
But I'll be here 15 minutes later tomorrow.

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,790
And I said, look, man, I don't care when you come and go.

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,760
As long as you put in your 80 hours a week, you'll be fine.

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,530


00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Fitz is just cruel.

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,590
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And he looked at me and he understood

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,820
that I was joking.

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,160
But he did get the point that he's responsible for making

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,430
things happen, and that it's not about being in a seat at a

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,940
certain time.

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,780
It's about being available to your team to make sure that

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,550
the work gets done.

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,470
You were telling me another time when we do a conference

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,420
in Chicago every winter where we rent out a big hall at a

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,760
university, a whole building in fact.

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,740
And one of the first times you went there, you went there to

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,270
get the keys from the person who runs the building.

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,380
And instead of a series of lectures about don't do this,

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,850
don't go here, blah, blah, blah, stay out of blah, blah,

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,690
blah, the guy was just like, here's the building.

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,130
Here are the keys.

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,930
I'll get them from you on Monday.

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,170
See you.

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,570
And like, you were telling me that was--

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That was intimidating.

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,550
It was really.

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It was intimidating because it's

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,880
like, wow, this person just put so much trust in me.

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
I better leave this place better then I found it, right.

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,030
They expect me to behave this way, so I'm going to live up

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,690
to their expectations.

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,100
I mean, if they set up this fence and they

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,010
say, here's the fence.

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,770
It's six feet tall.

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,390
It's made out of concrete.

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,090
Don't go any further than that.

00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,550
People will often just pile crap up against the fence

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,020
because they're like, I'm being treated like a child and

00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,870
I'm going to act like one.

00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,970
I'm a caged animal.

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,270
I'm going to run around and rattle the cage.

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,550
People look for those boundaries.

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,290
But when there are no boundaries and you're given

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,660
this responsibility, I think it's a great responsibility.

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So let's talk about another thing is

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,920
taking risks.

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,230
If you're in a company, in an organization where you are

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,800
allowed to take risks and to expand your comfort zone, you

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,520
can do things like fail fast.

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,590
You can take more responsibility.

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,590
You can fail, document what you've learned, adapt, and

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,620
then try again.

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,490
If somebody gets upset with failure, just explain to them

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,800
it's a way of learning really quickly.

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,300
Think about,

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,500
Think about-- anybody here have kids?

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,310
You can raise your hand.

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,650
You ever see a kid burn themself on the stove?

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,540
It's painful for the kid, but you know what?

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,590
They learn really fast that that's hot.

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So does my cat.

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And they don't want to touch that.

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,060
You can sit there and give them a lecture on

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,730
thermodynamics and all you want.

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,030
But, man, they just stick their hand in there and that's

00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,135
the last time they're ever going to pull that stunt.

00:11:59,135 --> 00:11:59,630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,200
Also when you exercise, that's one of the

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,770
things they talk about.

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,530
If you work out at a gym, sometimes you want to do

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,710
weights to the point where your muscles actually start to

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,175
fail because that's the point where you improve.

00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:12,910
If you always just do just enough exercise so that it's

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,370
comfortable and then you walk away, you never

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,510
really get any better.

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,460
You just stay at that level, right.

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,600
If you exercise to failure, you start to push yourself.

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,990
You grow, you adapt.

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right, right.

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,760
So without that risk, you really never improve.

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,150
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, those are a few of the tips that you

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,190
can do if you're living in a lovely garden that's well

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,320
raked like this.

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,020
Unfortunately, we're aware that most companies look a lot

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,920
more like this kind of a garden.

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
And most people work for people who

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,570
look more like this.

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,240
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So let's talk a little bit about the

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,520
bad manager which is--

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,380
there's a statistic--

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,210
and remember that 75% of all statistics are made up--

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,980
there's a statistic that 50% of the happiness of your job

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,740
comes from your manager, whether you're happy working

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,310
with them or working for them.

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,430
And that really is true in my experience.

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,340
I've had the, I'd say, opportunity to work for some

00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,105
really great managers in my time, not only at Google but

00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:12,940
in other places.

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,930
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, a typical bad manager is someone

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,600
who essentially prevents a lot of the things

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,930
we just talked about.

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,160
They prevent you from taking any risks at all.

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,510
Failure is a terrible thing.

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,920
Not even the smallest failure is terrifying to the manager.

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,500
And of course, that spills over to you.

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,580
And then you're afraid to take any risks, as well.

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,630
In addition, the manager also thinks that you're there to

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,230
serve him or her.

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,370
And again, instead of what can I do for you, it's what have

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,730
you done for me lately.

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,800
So, all the meetings you have are sort of

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,190
you're on the defensive.

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,460
You're always trying to prove that you have a value to him

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,350
or to the company.

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,725
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,380
How are you gonna help me climb the ladder because I'm

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,260
the manager here.

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,560
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,940
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And whatever you do, I'm gonna

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,680
take credit for it.

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Nasty.

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,300
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Unless you screw up, in which

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,590
case that's all you.

00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,800
And that's unfortunately how it works.

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,020
And this is something that most people don't talk about,

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,830
but everyone's aware of on the team, is that the bad manager

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,730
will ignore people like this, low performers on the team.

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,830
And that is one of the worst things that a

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,790
bad manager can do.

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, it's a huge drag on the team.

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,525
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, it destroys the team's morale.

00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:15,940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,490
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It causes you to lose your best

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,060
performers.

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,230
But, I mean, you've got six good guys on your team and one

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,770
person like this.

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,035
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And pretty soon, your best people

00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,790
on the team start to leave--

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,000
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because they get tired of dragging

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,830
this person along.

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,740
So a good manager's someone who's really going to take

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,950
care of low performers.

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,120
So this is some of the things that a bad manager might do.

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,910
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Other characters.

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Others characters.

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,510
Another important person to be very wary of is the office

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,290
politician.

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,980
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: He's awesome.

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,390
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is a very friendly person.

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,790
They're usually very great at managing up.

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,280
And this isn't necessarily a manager.

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,370
This might be another engineer on your team.

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,500
They're very quick to take credit for

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,780
something that happens.

00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,180
They're also very quick to assign blame.

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,120
But they put a lot of energy into looking impactful, but

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,410
not being impactful.

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Perception is 9/10 of the law.

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,440
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,730
Perception is 9/10 of the law.

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And they understand that.

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,660
And they do everything to make their perception as important

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
as possible.

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,100
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And the thing that most engineers will

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,380
do when they encounter someone like this is they'll just go

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,820
heads down and ignore them and say, I'm going

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,630
to write great code.

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,610
I'm going to have a great product.

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Engineers hate politics.

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: 'Cause I don't like the politics, and I

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,660
don't want to deal with this person.

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,320
But that's very dangerous because if you're not careful,

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,540
this person can wind up getting promoted and being

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,750
your manager.

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,690
We've seen that happen, too.

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,420
So they're someone to steer around.

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,140
But it's another example of why even if you don't like

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,040
dealing with the promotion process or stuff like that,

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,650
it's important to pay attention to that sort of

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,640
thing because it's a way of getting

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,230
yourself in a safe place.

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,740
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You don't want to get run

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,643
over by this person.

00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:50,530
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right, exactly.

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: If you're passive, that

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,630
can happen very easily.

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,670
Let's talk about the organization itself now, not

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,180
just the people you run into.

00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There are many types of bad

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,980
organizations out there.

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is one, for example.

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,760


00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,780
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And what are the stereotypes we all

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,160
know about?

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,560
What makes a corporation hostile to employees?

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,020
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Hey, Ben.

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,860
I'd like you to finish that product by Thursday.

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,220
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Awesome.

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And I want you to also test it.

00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,940
I want you to QA it, push it into production.

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,710
And, oh, I have a new feature I'd like to add in as well.

00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Didn't you just take somebody away

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,350
from my team?

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,730
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,510
But you should be skydiving in with the product tomorrow--

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:24,775
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Excellent.

00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --as well.

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No problem.

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,030
So, right.

00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And don't forget about the

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,630
bike and the rappeling.

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Impossible.

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,100
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, yeah, impossible schedules,

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,610
impossible expectations, not enough resources to get done

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,620
what they're asking you to do.

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And when talking about resources, we

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,540
mean like--

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,920
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: People.

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --computing resources, not people.

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,800
People are not resources.

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,260
They're people.

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You don't like it

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,640
when people call them--

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I don't like it when people call--

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,140
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: How many resources do you

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,380
have on your team?

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,420
That's a pet peeve.

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,430
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But we've all seen companies where you

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,430
can spend $3,000 on hardware and save hundreds of engineer

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,140
hours, but companies don't do that because you're already

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,420
there and you're going on.

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,990
That's a capital expenditure.

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,970
You're just a payroll expenditure, and--

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,500
They don't do the math with the big [? scheme. ?]

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,569
So that's definitely something to be wary about.

00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, something else that big

00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,470
corporations tend to do is they simply don't trust you.

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,280
We talked about trust earlier, right.

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,990
They treat you like a caged animal.

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,280
They treat you like a naughty child.

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,470
They just see you as replaceable, expendable.

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,940
And in the worst case, they just see you

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,319
as a cog in a machine.

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,350
This person is here to do x units of work

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,970
in y amount of time.

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,660
And turn the key, it should all just work.

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,770
And we're not doing an assembly line here, right.

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,060
This is a creative job that requires a creative

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,900
environment and a lot of social skills to survive.

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,130
It's not just line up replaceable parts

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,020
and turn the knob.

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,760
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And there's a lot of different

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,410
technological ways that this happens.

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,410
You get time cards where you punch in and you punch out.

00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,450
Or you're caged by your IT department in so far as we're

00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,110
gonna set up a big firewall and prevent you from going to

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,870
any website that might distract you

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,840
or waste your time.

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,850
And we see companies do this all the time.

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,740
Or we're gonna prevent people from checking their personal

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,500
mail or from using instant messenger, all

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,110
that sort of thing.

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just like a naughty child.

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,590
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly, just like a naughty child.

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,450
And we're gonna measure your productivity in great ways,

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,980
like lines of code.

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,560
See how many many lines of code you wrote today.

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,150
That is a great way to encourage people to write lots

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,400
of lines of code, of crappy code, right.

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: More code is always better.

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,480
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I'd like to rate people on how much code

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,620
they delete myself.

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,070
But--

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's true.

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,950
Yeah, hard metric.

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,800
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And so beyond this, things start to

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,900
get a little fuzzier.

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,220
Some companies suffer from this complete chaos of

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,160
direction where there's too many leaders

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,150
without a central vision.

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,530
You might have seven different bosses giving contradictory

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,250
directions.

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,790
What was it, the quote from Office Space?

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,420
Bob.

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,610
I have seven bosses or eight bosses, or whatever it was.

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,040
But another characteristic of this organization is one

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,360
that's obsessed with titles and hierarchy and political

00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,740
power struggles.

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,880
And I have you on my team and your miserable and you really

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,830
want to work on that team, but I'm not letting go of you

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,980
because if you leave, I can't get anyone else.

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,570
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's just that the amount of distraction

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,450
is huge too, right.

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,070
Even if you put forth Herculean effort to achieve

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,190
these impossible goals, if different bosses are moving

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,660
the goalposts around all the time depending where you talk,

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,760
it's just infuriating.

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,210
It just drives you insane.

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,580
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And to some extent, this exists in even

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,360
companies that are well organized and high

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,710
functioning.

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,480
Years ago when I first became a manager at Google, I was in

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,735
my happy little [? world, ?] writing code and shipping code

00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,460
and moving things in production.

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,640
Everything seemed pretty straightforward to me.

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,140
I knew where we're going.

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,250
And then I became a manager, and I was talking to all these

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,820
other higher ups.

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,490
And suddenly there's all these different things.

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,240
We should do this.

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,450
Maybe we should do that.

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,102
And I went and talked to the guy who had previously been

00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,650
manager and I said, the company's gone

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,140
crazy all of a sudden.

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,790
What happened?

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,110
I'm like, we were all going this way and now it's

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,240
like all like this.

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,800
And he's like, it's been like this forever.

00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,010
He's like, I've just been hiding all that crap from you

00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,550
because it's--

00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Really good manager.

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --it's a distraction.

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,770
And I'm like, wow, you weren't as bad as I thought you were.

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,638
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No.

00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,040
Yeah.

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,690
But that's the sign of a great leader or manager, protects

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,610
the reports from that chaos so they can get their work done.

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,110
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's fantastic when it happens.

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,430
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's also the sign of a

00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,470
great cleaning person.

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,235
You only notice it when they're gone.

00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:18,480
Like, this place is a dump.

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, let's talk about how we

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,140
actually get things done in a dysfunctional organization or

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,380
even just a large organization.

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,290
The amount of dysfunction varies from place to place.

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,770
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is how you're gonna survive in a

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
particularly toxic environment.

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Here is the magic question.

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,930
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The magic question.

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, the first thing we like to talk

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,440
about-- and this is something you'll actually

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,370
hear a lot at Google.

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,290
It's attributed to various famous folks.

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,340
I forgot--

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No, it's attributed to

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,130
Grace Hopper, I believe.

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yes, yes.

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,360
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And if anyone hasn't seen Grace

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,550
Hopper's talk on nanoseconds, go check it out.

00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,640
It's on the internet.

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,560
We're big fans of the internet.

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, the trick here is this is about

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,230
risk taking, but a particular kind of risk taking.

00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,540
It's know how far you can go without seriously jeopardizing

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,930
your career, the risk of getting fired.

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,810
But you will discover it's amazing.

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,770
If you know something needs to be done, you know what the

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,210
right thing is to do, and you go in there and you start

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,230
asking your seven bosses, can I do this?

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,790
Can I do this?

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,120
Every time you ask someone is an invitation to say no.

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,320
And that's the default answer, right, especially in an

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,600
organization where people are afraid of failure or risk.

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,935
So--

00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:23,820
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And the reason a lot of people ask

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,070
permission is because you're relieving yourself of

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,540
responsibility.

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,990
I could be, look, I asked the Bobs.

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,570
They said it was OK, or they said no.

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,810
So, the Bobs are preventing me from getting stuff done.

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's scary to take responsibility

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,480
when you're doing a risk.

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,120
But often that's the only way to get anything done.

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,890
So act first, apologize later.

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,330
That's the other way I've heard this phrase.

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,080
And don't do anything that you can't undo.

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,680
That's sort of the rule of thumb, I suppose.

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,300
And be prepared to back up your decision if someone does

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,210
come to you and say, why on Earth did you do this?

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,600
And if it fails, try again, right.

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,900
But at least you're getting something way more done than

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,230
the folks who are scared or folks who are just asking

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,250
permission, being turned down all the time.

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,260
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you can usually choose the action or

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,410
the consequences, but not both.

00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:07,940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I like this.

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,660
Yes.

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,060
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: OK, so--

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Give an example.

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,250
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: An example is--

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You control either the action or

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,680
the consequence of the action.

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:13,870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,210
So I can launch a product, but I don't know how it's going to

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,240
come out necessarily.

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
Or I cannot launch a product, and I know that nothing bad's

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,890
gonna happen.

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,020


00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,560
You'll see this a lot in family situations.

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,760
I'm gonna say something to my family because gosh darn it,

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,250
I'm gonna show them that this is the way it's gonna be.

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But then you can't control the result.

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can't control the way that they're

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,230
gonna act or the way that they're gonna behave.

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,040
So--

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But, let's say the

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,460
other side is I want--

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,800
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can change your actions to achieve

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,550
a particular consequence.

00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The result is that I want my uncle

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,050
to be happy--

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That would be something different.

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --I have to work backwards and do an

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,540
action that I know is gonna cause that.

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:46,900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And that's

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,890
definitely the case in companies.

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,080
And it's not a rational thing.

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,490
Some people would say, well, I'm gonna act this way, and

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,730
you should act this way.

00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,540
If you ever hear yourself saying to someone, well,

00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,460
so-and-so should do something, you should

00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,650
just stop right there.

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,810
Should is a magic word that shows up in your head that

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,720
means that you are trying to control the future.

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,560
And it's really difficult unless you're Batman or Sergey

00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,120
Brin, or both.

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,200
I don't know.

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,110
So, not saying anything.

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,210
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I've never seen them together.

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I've never seen them together either.

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,290
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's very strange.

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So let's talk about choosing battles.

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,730
This is something that comes up a lot.

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,210
There's usually folks in your organization or on your team

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,740
who are very opinionated.

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,060
Nothing wrong with that.

00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,040
Problem is they don't always know which fights to choose.

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,730
And that is a hard lesson to learn for some folks.

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,410
They put so much energy into being so passionate about

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,460
everything that they end up getting almost nothing done

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,250
because they're not choosing their battles.

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,300
And it tends to drag down the momentum of the team.

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,310
It tends to drag down momentum of the leader of the team,

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,880
having to defend and deal with everything that's happening.

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
So, you need to know not only just which battles to choose.

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,330
You need to understand what kind of political capital

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,100
you're spending to win a certain battle.

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Is it worth it?

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,810
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Is it worth it?

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,020
Are you gonna spend all your capital over here or are you

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,780
gonna spend it over here?

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,530
Because once you've used it up-- you've called in your

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,440
favors, you've done whatever--

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,200
you can't just turn around and have another screaming battle

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,050
the next day on a different subject.

00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,750
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because if you think of it as a train and

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,890
you're trying to stop every engineer that comes by every

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,270
15 minutes in the train, eventually they're just gonna

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,630
run you right over.

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And lose their patience.

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They lose their patience.

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,800
But also remember that every time people hit the brakes,

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,990
you're slowing down the progress of the product.

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,170
So that's something that you really got to be careful and

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,420
think about, is it worth it?

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,690


00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,160
If you're gonna beg forgiveness rather than ask

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,850
permission, make sure it's for the right thing.

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,180
You don't want to spend all your political capital in

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,110
making t-shirts or something.

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,810
You'd be better to spend it on launching a product--

00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now sometimes you have a really

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,280
great idea but you're not sure how to communicate it upwards

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,250
in the organization or laterally to other teams.

00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,340
And you'll fight a battle, and you'll scream about it.

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,950
And it turns out sometimes the best way to get your idea out

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,780
there is not to make a giant stink about it, but instead to

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,580
do the subtle, subliminal way of moving the message around.

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,300
So it turns out that your ideas can go really, really

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,570
far in a company--

00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:13,970
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Really far.

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --if you don't take the credit for it,

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,170
or if you just don't care whether you get

00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,370
credit for the idea.

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,710
So it can be something as simple, at the grassroots

00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,460
level, just sort of whispering this idea to certain friends

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,080
or to certain people on another team

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,100
at the lunch table.

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,410
Or mention it in passing when a VP is walking by.

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,580
And maybe he'll overhear.

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,500
It's an art form in itself, but it's

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,420
actually pretty powerful.

00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,600
We've seen this happen, right, where an idea--

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,090
and by the time maybe somebody at the top who is a decision

00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,940
maker hears the idea formally presented, there's been so

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,280
much buzz about it already in the company that it doesn't

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,040
seem like such a crazy idea.

00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,350
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you can actively use this if you're

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,680
trying to change someone's mind in your organization, is

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,930
tell people that you know who trust you that they trust and

00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,180
ask them to mention the idea to that person.

00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,510
And if they hear it from [INAUDIBLE], even if they know

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,300
what's going on, if they keep hearing this over and over

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,670
again, they're gonna be like, hey.

00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,550
And next thing you know, you hear it coming out of some

00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,160
vice president's mouth at a press conference or something.

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,780
And your response can be, hey, that's my idea.

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,460
Or you can be like, hey, that's my idea.

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,080
That's pretty awesome.

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:16,720
Yeah.

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,450
What's more important?

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,215
That it happens or that you get the credit?

00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:19,680
Sometimes you have to choose.

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,550
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You're choosing, right.

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,360
You have to choose sometimes.

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,170
So, let's talk about habits.

00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,990
Anyone here has ever attempted to quit something, like quit

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,310
smoking, quit drinking?

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,920
Some people I know--

00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Caffeine.

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --have to quit eating.

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Have to quit eating.

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,600
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But bad habits, or systems, really

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,080
can't be destroyed.

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,560
But we found that they can be replaced by a new habit.

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,180
OK.

00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,070
You have a great example of this you did with one of the

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,005
teams you work with.

00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:45,280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,750
We had--

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,640
one of the teams I took over, at least for awhile, had this

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,490
standing meeting.

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,850
I know it was Agile Scrum something something something.

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,325
But--

00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:55,860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It was Agile--

00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Oh, OK.

00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,085
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --at one point.

00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:57,350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm not trained in those magic techniques.

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,970
But it was every morning.

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,535
We're gonna all stand here for 20 minutes or whatever and go

00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:04,910
around in a circle, blah, blah, blah.

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,980
And people were kind of frustrated with it, but they

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,310
were just doing it out of habit.

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, but it turned into an hour, right?

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Got worse.

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,460
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: There was sitting down, and it was like

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,180
group therapy.

00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,650
Well, you know, I went out--

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:13,850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Not so efficient.

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --last night.

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:15,310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,480
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You know, I don't have anything really to

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,080
say but I want to talk about Rails, you know.

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,460
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But the thing is--

00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Ow.

00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,370
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's cool.

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:22,890
It's cool.

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Oh, oh, stop.

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,770
But the point is it wasn't a totally useless meeting.

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,210
There were some nuggets of

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,860
communication going on in there.

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,170
So it would not have been, probably, that smart to just

00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,090
be like, this is stupid.

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,060
Kill this meeting forever.

00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,200
Go away.

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,600
Instead, we just replaced it.

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,580
We said, all right, let's instead have just an email

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,930
thread that goes out every morning.

00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,890
You have a cron job that just sends an email saying, hey,

00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,930
what's going on?

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,980
What did you do yesterday?

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,600
What are you blocked on today?

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,470
Everybody reply to this thread, right.

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,810
Everybody spends 30 seconds replying.

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,380
You're done.

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,510
People can read the thread whenever they want.

00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,610
So much more efficient.

00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,110
Gets the exact same sort of thing done.

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,990
And it sparks off side conversations, which is all

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,070
that matters.

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,620
That's we wanted.

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,040
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But there's one sneaky thing you did as

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,890
well in that, is that-- and this is a sneaky technique for

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,380
introducing anything new or changing anything--

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,780
is three magic words, let's try this.

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,960
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We can always undo.

00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,710
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Let's try this for 30 days.

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,950
Let's try this for two weeks.

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,825
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If it doesn't work, everybody hates

00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,000
it, we'll go back.

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,560
And oftentimes, people are like, oh my God, I mean, it's

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,210
not permanent.

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,670
We can actually just try something for 30 days.

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:27,920
OK.

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,790
And then after three weeks, they're like, oh,

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,080
it wasn't so bad.

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,270
This isn't so--

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,935
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or they just forget it was a trial and

00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:33,650
just do it forever.

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,130
That's usually what happens if it goes well.

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And beyond that, let's talk about-- back

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,305
to the organization and moving around.

00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,580
This is something that most engineers we know-- and it's

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,390
often been abhorrent to us, I think, as well--

00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,850
is the ladder of a company.

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,130
OK.

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,480
We talked earlier about the office politician who's always

00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,660
sort of working it, trying to go up the ladder.

00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,780
And most of these bad companies, bad

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,520
organizations, have--

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,590
there's a mismatch between doing the right thing for the

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,380
company and doing the right thing to promoted.

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,780
OK.

00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,030
So you have to make a choice.

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,430
And it doesn't have to be black or white.

00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,930
It can be a little bit of a gray blend.

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,440
You can do a little bit of both.

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,690
But it's dangerous if you choose to always do the right

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,700
thing and ignore being promoted.

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,540
OK.

00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,540
So, as we mentioned earlier, you should climb this ladder

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,820
until you get to a safe place.

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,200
And so, it is worthwhile to spend energy on that.

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,060
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This works particularly in

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,070
companies that are very power driven, that where hierarchy

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,000
and title is right at the forefront of everybody's mind.

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,500
That if you can get yourself up to a high title, then

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,200
people will leave you alone because you've got power,

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,240
right, or some imaginary title that tells people

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,230
to leave you alone.

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,850
Just working the system, right?

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,420
It's your bubble.

00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,550
It's your safe haven.

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now a companion to that idea is not

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,700
only can you work up the ladder to the point where

00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,380
nobody can tell you what to do, you can go find some place

00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,250
in the company to hide.

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,180
It sounds crazy, but there are projects

00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,430
that don't get bothered.

00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,540
There are teams that have so much credibility that no one

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,080
will question or bug you, or just give you a bunch of

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,040
freedom that you might not have otherwise.

00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,660
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: There's often an executive who values

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,220
what you're doing, as well, more than some other executive

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,210
that might be in a different part of the company.

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,280
So moving to a different department or different team

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,300
or something is often a good way of being safe when the

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,320
nuclear war comes.

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sometimes you have to do this every

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,480
couple years as the company changes if you

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,300
want to stay happy.

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Some of us have been in companies that

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,680
every fifth Thursday is layoff Thursday.

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,200
I worked at a company years ago that I will not name and

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,755
nobody answered the phone on Thursday.

00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:39,425


00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:42,480
And if your boss showed up in your office all a sudden, it

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,710
was just panic time.

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,760
But--

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Talk about perception.

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,300
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Perception, yeah.

00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,570
Upward perception.

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This is a tricky thing.

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,730
We said earlier that perception is 9/10 of the law.

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,190
And so what that really means is being aware not just of

00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,340
getting stuff done and doing the right thing, but always be

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,690
thinking in the back of your head, how does this look to

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,190
people not on my team or people above my level?

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,930
What are they perceiving, right, because that is at

00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,210
least as important as what you're actually doing.

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,290
The office politician knows this.

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,260
And you need to at least--

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,290
maybe you don't need to manipulate people the way the

00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,140
office politician does, but at least you need to be aware of

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,840
it and make sure it is not misrepresenting what you're

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,590
actually doing.

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:19,860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, you want to launch things as much

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,080
as possible because that creates a great perception.

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,510
You want to under-promise.

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,110
You want to over-deliver.

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,100
These are all things we strive for.

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,960
And I personally, I had problems with this when I

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,580
first became a manager, a leader.

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,160
My team had the project [INAUDIBLE], we had a huge

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,960
amount of technical debt, and it was just crushing us.

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,630
So the first thing I said was, all right guys, I'm the new

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,470
leader here.

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,360
We really need to hunker down and spend the next six or nine

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,950
months just focusing on our technical debt so that we can

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,990
be free of these shackles and then move on.

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,190
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And your director said--

00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:53,670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Great idea.

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:53,880
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The director was

00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,570
like, that's great.

00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:54,940
We love it.

00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,980
You should totally do that.

00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980
Of course, he was completely wrong.

00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,650
He didn't actually--

00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,400
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He wasn't lying.

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,540
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, he didn't-- he thought it was a

00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:00,560
great idea--

00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,020
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He thought it was a great idea.

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,920
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --intellectually.

00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,060
The problem isn't-- this is something I've come to think

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,400
about later-- is that I have this idea in my head now what

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,760
we call offensive versus defensive work.

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,590
Offensive work is work that is very visible to outsiders,

00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,490
like, write a new shiny feature, make this product

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,020
faster, anything that's going to be impressive to people

00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,850
outside your team.

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,570
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A lot faster.

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Really visible.

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,850
Defensive work is just as important as offensive work.

00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,350
It's all the invisible work, right.

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,590
Oh, we're gonna maintain the product.

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,000
We're gonna migrate the database.

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,790
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Refactor--

00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We're gonna refactor code--

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,920
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --code.

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,320
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --so it's more maintainable.

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,510
We're gonna make our monitoring of our systems more

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,360
robust so we have better uptime.

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,250
That's all stuff that's completely thankless when your

00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,200
management looks down.

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,040
It looks like you're doing nothing.

00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,710
And that was a huge slap in my face because after six months

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,880
my director was like, why aren't

00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,930
you guys doing anything.

00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,080
I'm like, oh, look, we did all this.

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,140
We're doing so much work.

00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,270
And like, it looks like you're doing nothing to me.

00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,090
And he was annoyed.

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,220
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Looks like you're fixing crap that you

00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,140
broke in the first place.

00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah, right.

00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:56,840
So--

00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,850
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,330
Why didn't you write it right the first time?

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's no sympathy.

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,420
There's no-- so that's the sad politics there is that even

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,900
though defensive work is just as important as offensive

00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,680
work, you cannot spend all your time on defensive work.

00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And to be clear, this isn't a malicious

00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,660
attitude that people have.

00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
It's just the--

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Human psyche.

00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,680
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --perception

00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,160
is 9/10 of the law.

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,650
And that's absolutely the way it is.

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So we have a rule for now where

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,070
about usually--

00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,260
never spend more than about a third of your time and energy

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,030
as a team on defensive work.

00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,480
Because if you do more than that, then people just think

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,580
you're holding still.

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:30,820
And--

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,980
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If you do less than that, your product

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,113
falls over.

00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:34,100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,040
But it's a tricky balance to find.

00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,435
But you have to stay aware of that.

00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,810
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, next we want to talk about--

00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,530
I want to make you an offer that you can't refuse.

00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,150
Think of the movie The Godfather.

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,270
There's a favor economy, that isn't necessarily done, and

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,950
there's not cash.

00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,520
It's like someone asks you to do something that you can

00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,930
easily do--

00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,320
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or you could easily say no.

00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,700
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can easily say no, but it's

00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,010
typically gonna be easier for you to do it, or make it

00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,040
happen, than for them.

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,590
And, it's very much in your best interest, most of the

00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,440
time, to do that for someone.

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,990
Now, I'm not--

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,949
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Not in the short term.

00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Not in the short term, because it can

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,250
take a little bit of your time.

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,040
And I'm not saying that you should be a doormat or let

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,460
anyone walk over you or someone continue to take

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,820
advantage of you.

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,570
But look for opportunities to help.

00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,630
And these are the kind of thing-- it's like making small

00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,370
bets, where there's no real house edge here.

00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,590
You make a small bet and some of them,

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,360
you're just gonna lose.

00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,480
A buck, it's gone.

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,070
Buck, it's gone.

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,179
But every once in awhile, you're gonna win the lottery,

00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,940
and it's gonna come back and pay you back in spades.

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,010
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So when we talk about building up

00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,010
trust, making these small favors, you're building up

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,790
karma and trust that will come back eventually.

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,219
There was a great quote somebody gave when we talked

00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,420
about this idea with them.

00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,800
The quote was, friends come and go but enemies accumulate.

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,250
It's a great thing because basically it's saying don't

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,150
burn bridges.

00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,110
That's the corollary to this theme is that it will destroy

00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,550
your karma and trust in this favor economy if you leave and

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,250
burn a bridge.

00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,390
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And sometimes you

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,520
get very quick return.

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,090
I mean like the recruiting team called us up and they

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,080
said, hey, you guys are those two nerds with

00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,770
the lab coats, right?

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,600
We want to do some videos where people can talk to

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,550
engineers--

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,430
ask questions of Google engineers.

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,275
Would you guys mind taking some time to do a video?

00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:17,580
Now--

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We could have said no.

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,305
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Could have said no.

00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:22,400
It is a half hour, 45 minutes out of our day.

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,620
And we said, oh, sure.

00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,200
Yeah, we'll do that.

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,930
So we did this video for them.

00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,730
And they were super glad to throw some extra recruiting

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,330
resources to help us find some people for our teams.

00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,710
Because now they know us.

00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,460
Anyone in recruiting's like, hey, you guys.

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,150
Your [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,760
been such a huge help.

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,930
And it's actually been a bigger bet because other

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,650
recruiters worldwide are using this video to, well, to

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,450
recruit more people.

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We get to do fun things like interviews

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,950
at IO for the live stream because of what we started

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,190
because of small favors.

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,300
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Those are just--

00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Fun stuff.

00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,110
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --some really visible examples.

00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,050
But it extends to absolutely everything.

00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,390
There's a book called The Luck Factor.

00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,520
Anyone heard of it?

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
The guy did a test.

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,290
He put an ad out, and he said, are you lucky or unlucky?

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,395
Please come take a small survey--

00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:08,670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Who responds--

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,005
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --a small test--

00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:09,730
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --to an ad like that?

00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:09,980
Sorry.

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,220
Do you consider yourself lucky or unlucky?

00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,110
Please take this--

00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,090
I guess it's people who don't have a job.

00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,750
I don't know.

00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,520
So you had all these people come in who said that.

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,710
And he said, are you lucky or unlucky?

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,060
And they'd say I'm lucky or not.

00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,410
And then he'd say, here's the front page of a newspaper.

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,200
I'd like you to read this.

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,990
I'm gonna time you.

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,000
And we're gonna see how fast you can count all the pictures

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,690
in the front section of the newspaper.

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,180
Ready?

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,250
Go.

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,150
And now the average person who considered themselves unlucky

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,990
took about two minutes and 16 seconds to

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,770
find all the pictures.

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,750
The average lucky person took less than four seconds to find

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,600
all the pictures.

00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: How is that possible?

00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,160
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That's possible.

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,330
In the middle of the third page in 144 point type it

00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,390
said, there are 42 pictures in this section.

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,370
OK.

00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,390
Unlucky people were very focused on exactly the task at

00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,270
hand and nothing else.

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,220
The lucky people were the people who maybe looked a

00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,280
little bit outside.

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,610
And so the point of this book is that you can actually

00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,580
manufacture luck for yourself.

00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,760
And the favor economy in a company is a

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,920
way of making luck.

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,670
And so we're big fans of that.

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,490
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Love it.

00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,130
So, it also helps, sort of following in this theme of

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,730
favor economies, finding influential friends.

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,250
And what we mean by that is there's certain categories of

00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,120
people within a company who are very

00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,500
useful allies to have.

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,180
We'll talk about them.

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I mean, sometimes it's useful years

00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,950
and years later, right?

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,760
It turns out I ended up managing my former TA in

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,210
college, became my report.

00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,050
It was very strange.

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,000
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a good thing he was nice to you--

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: He was very nice--

00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:37,970
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --in college.

00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --to me, right.

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,610
But again, that's all about don't burn bridges because you

00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:41,990
never know.

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,480
The person who you have a fight with now may be your

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,680
manager in the next company.

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,290
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Especially in the--

00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:46,610
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So you don't know.

00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:46,810
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --tech world.

00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,360
The tech world is super, super way smaller than

00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,160
you think of it.

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,800
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Surprisingly small.

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,210
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Our friend Carl likes to say there's only

00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,190
about 3,000 people in the tech world.

00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,240
Everyone else is local color.

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,700
So let's think about that next time you quit your job and

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,350
want to go out in a blaze of glory and tell everybody

00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,330
exactly what you think about them.

00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,210
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Jump off the plane.

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,740
Go down the chute, right.

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,910
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,700
Take your beer and hit the chute, right.

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,300
So the first kind of person is a connector.

00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,850
These are people who, basically, one of their

00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,000
part-time jobs is connecting you with other people.

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,030
If you need to get a hold of somebody in the company, you

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,900
don't know where to go, they're the person you're

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,020
gonna say, hey, you have any [? tips? ?]

00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,340
They'll be like, yep, talk to Megan--

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,020
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Human routers.

00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --talk to Steve.

00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,810
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They are literally human routers.

00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They're very well connected.

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,700
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Beyond the connectors, find people who

00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,260
have influence within the company.

00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,720
We happen to be lucky to have Vint Cerf, who discovers

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,780
wonderful things like the internet.

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Also, they aren't necessarily

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,420
celebrities either.

00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,200
So they could just be someone who's been at the company for

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,170
20 years, a real old timer, may not be in a great position

00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,320
of power, but, boy, they know how the company works.

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,710
They know who everybody is.

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,000
And they are sort of secretly able to influence things just

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,530
behind the scenes.

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,170
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: With very subtle movements.

00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:55,520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:55,880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: RIght.

00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Good ways to whisper those ideas that

00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,450
you don't want to take credit for necessarily.

00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,120
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, I'd like to stop for second and

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,330
give you all a word of warning.

00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,784
Do not screw with administrative assistants.

00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:10,180
OK?

00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,070
You might think it's just some guy or woman or whatever at a

00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,490
typewriter and typing stuff up, all right.

00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,130
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They look harmless.

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They look harmless, but

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,596
they will cut you.

00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:21,030
OK.

00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: If you cross them.

00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,620
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If you cross this person, she will

00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,630
ruin your life.

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,270
OK.

00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,580
Administrative assistants--

00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,620
and I'm not saying that-- again, we're not talking about

00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,220
manipulating--

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,050
we're talking about manipulating.

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,110
We're not talking about being like that office politician.

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,920
We're just talking about a little bit of yes time, a

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,380
little bit of politeness.

00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,940
It goes a long way.

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,270
It really does.

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,655
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's an immense amount of power

00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:41,170
that flows--

00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,990
I mean, there's like the official org chart.

00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,650
Then there's the real chart of power.

00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,260
And administrative assistants are right in there, way more

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,270
powerful than you think.

00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,540
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, a good administrative assistant

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,210
will wield their executive's power and--

00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: As a proxy.

00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,430
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.

00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,940
But, yeah.

00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,520
So you don't want to be on the wrong side of that.

00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,030
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Great.

00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,110
So, the other thing, just talking just about in terms of

00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,150
communicating with people, a lot of people love to do

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,760
electronic communication.

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,780
You're gonna do email.

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,110
You're gonna do chat rooms.

00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,770
You're gonna do instant messages.

00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,080
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Hangouts on air--

00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Hang [? outside ?]

00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,400
[? air. ?]

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,510
Face time is a huge deal.

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,000
The mere act of getting on a plane and flying to the other

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,600
branch of your company, or just driving to wherever the

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,670
other office is--

00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,070
being in somebody's face has a massive impact, not just on

00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,020
the ability to get things done, just in the connection

00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,650
you make with that person.

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,150
10 minutes in the face of an executive, or whoever, is

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,160
gonna have a much more memorable connection to that

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,130
person than 20 emails you have over two weeks.

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,840
It's not the same.

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I learned this lesson.

00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,900
I've known this for years, but I decided to take a shortcut a

00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,540
few months ago.

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,380
I had a meeting with a senior vice president.

00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,320
It's a 15 minute meeting.

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,870
I wasn't gonna fly out to Mountain

00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,260
View for that or anything.

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,960
And we had a global outage of our video conferencing system.

00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,700
And so then I backed off to Google Voice, which was out.

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,932
So, I'm in my cell phone, kneeling down in the corner of

00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:03,950
our building trying to get a signal with my one hand in my

00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,060
ear and my phone up against my head.

00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,090
And they can't hear.

00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,210
They heard every third word.

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,100
So, that's a very extreme example.

00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,550
But being there, being there face-to-face, in person, is

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,000
not only more helpful in the room, but where it helps is

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,410
coming into the room and going out of the room You've got

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:24,730
little more time.

00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,780
Hey, how was your weekend?

00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,290
What did you do?

00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,080
What's going on?

00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,200
You wind up with chance encounters in the hallway.

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,170
You might walk to the next meeting with this person, get

00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,040
a few extra minutes.

00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,060
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's another reason why we talk

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,970
about how it's so important for teams

00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,760
to have lunch together.

00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,560
We give tours of our office in Chicago.

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,050
And we show them the cafe where you get

00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,050
free lunch for Google.

00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,150
And a lot of people will say, I don't know how Google can

00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,060
afford this?

00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,590
And the answer is, how can Google not afford this.

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,405
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Return on investment.

00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:51,270
It's so great.

00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,790
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's huge to get your teams--

00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,610
even if they're not talking about your product-- get

00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,850
people together for lunch.

00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,620
Get them to understand that they're working with other

00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,180
human beings that have lives, that have wives

00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,665
and children, perhaps.

00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:04,180
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Absolutely.

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,440
Sometimes when you're trying to do electronic communication

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,040
with people, they don't respond or

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,810
they're too busy, right.

00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,190
It's amazing when you just pop your face over

00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,930
at their desk or--

00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:14,450
this is crazy.

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,450
Sometimes we pick up the phone, and we call their desk.

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,330
And they jump because they're like, what's that thing

00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,220
ringing on my desk.

00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,740
I forgot it was there.

00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,970
What is that for?

00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: How many engineers hate the phone?

00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,600
I don't even have a phone on my desk anymore.

00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,540
It rings through Gmail, which is kind of cool.

00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,140
But even when that rings, I'm like what is that?

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,820
I prefer the asynchronous communication.

00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,220
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, there is a trick.

00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Sometimes you need to communicate with executives.

00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,320
Something's important enough that you actually need to get

00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,750
in front of them and ask them for something.

00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,180
And there is an anti-pattern and there's a pattern here we

00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,380
want to promote.

00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,490
The anti-pattern is to--

00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,860
maybe you're not right in front of their face.

00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,960
Maybe you just want to send an email.

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,350
And the anti-pattern is you go in and you write this long

00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,280
rant, this tirade about something's

00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,990
wrong, blah, blah, blah.

00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,280
This is wrong.

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,510
Then I did this and this--

00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,550
And it's 15 paragraphs long--

00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,390
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No line breaks.

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,250
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No line---

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:05,920
and all sorts of--

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because this is your chance.

00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All sorts of questions in there,

00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,580
embedded in there, right.

00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,445
And what does an executive do when they get

00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:12,150
an email like that?

00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,500
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Delete.

00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,190
Now why do they do that?

00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,760
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because they just don't have time to

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,300
understand it.

00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,990
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,480
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A busy executive gets about 10

00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,370
seconds to go through email.

00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,900
If any of you have ever seen an exec's inbox, it looks like

00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,650
a distributed denial of service.

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,625
Because the emails just come, and they come from everywhere.

00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:32,350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And so, you get about 10 seconds of their

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,770
time before they timeout.

00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,180
So if they get 10 seconds into your first paragraph and

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,000
you're on bullet point one of 612 and they can't figure out

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,625
the point, they're just gonna delete it.

00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,870
I wish I could help this guy, just don't have time.

00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,570
And people, like Ben said, will usually rant forever.

00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, we have a technique that we think

00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,670
works pretty well, has worked for us.

00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,620
We call it the three bullets and a call to action.

00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,450
So essentially, you make three short bullet points, one

00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,580
sentence each if possible.

00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,000
We love this example.

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is how to get a pony.

00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,730
This is a fun example.

00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,430
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And then a single request at the end.

00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,540
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A single request.

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,460
This is a great example.

00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,080
But I would like to disclaim, once again, that it doesn't

00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,492
work for insane things.

00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:16,860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It doesn't work for getting a pony.

00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,020
It doesn't work for getting Ford to buy your new laser

00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,250
windshield wiper idea.

00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,800
And it's not gonna get you a meeting

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,060
with the CEO of Amazon.

00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,336
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No.

00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:28,340
But it did work one time when you were

00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,680
working for Apple, before--

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:29,880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --you got to Google.

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,920
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, I've been refining this since first

00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,690
a version of this worked for me.

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,520
I was at Apple about--

00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,460
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: 10 years ago?

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: 11 years ago.

00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,450
And I'd bought my mom one of those big strawberry iMacs.

00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,080
It turned out it was a lemon iMac.

00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,310
And it just kept failing.

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,150
And it spent more time in the shop than ever.

00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,590
And I was super mad and super frustrated.

00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,340
And somebody was like, hey, Steve's email is

00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,140
sjobs@apple.com.

00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just mail Steve.

00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:53,843
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, great.

00:44:53,843 --> 00:44:54,770
Oh my God.

00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,820
And I just like started ranting.

00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,770
My mom got this computer and she works at the school and

00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,790
she did this and she did that and she rebooted.

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,640
And then, you know, like, it was like 3,000 words.

00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,540
And this very wise guy I worked with said, look, you're

00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,750
just wasting your time.

00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,690
He's like, make it short--

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Really short.

00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,560
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Really short and a call to action.

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,320
So, I made it really short, as short as I could, which was

00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,520
still too long.

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,060
And then I said, look, basically I just want to

00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,230
resolve this so my mom doesn't have this

00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,210
crappy, broken computer.

00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,100
Because I feel bad.

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,750
I work at Apple.

00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,520
I'm trying to defend it.

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,810
And she's telling all her friends she's

00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,990
got this busted computer.

00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,050
And about 15 hours later I got a call from somebody who

00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,950
worked for Steve and said, hey--

00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:35,182
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:

00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:36,280
Administrative assistant, perhaps.

00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:36,530
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No.

00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:36,810
It wasn't.

00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No, OK.

00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Someone in corporate executive relations,

00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,960
which is an assistant of sorts.

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,740
And a week later, my mom had a new Mac.

00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,320
And we've refined this, and we've tried

00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,010
this over the years.

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,910
And the shorter you go-- and when I say three bullet

00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:56,710
points, I mean, three 80 character bullet points.

00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,290
You can't just keep going under this

00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,560
line wrap stuff, right.

00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now, sometimes you can

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,200
make links to other--

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,510
like, if you want more detail, if they're really think

00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:08,190
they're gonna need background, you can put a hyperlink in

00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,510
there or draw a line and say, you know, detail is

00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,110
below if you care.

00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,040
But as long as the top can be parsed in 10

00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,090
seconds, you're set.

00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:15,410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:15,570
So.

00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,290
Yeah, sometimes I'll do that.

00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,130
I'll put at the top brief summary and then long boring,

00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:20,945
long-winded rant--

00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,080
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: TLD [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --after your signature and everything.

00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,000
But the fact of the matter is that executives usually, if

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,980
they can wave a magic wand and have someone that works for

00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,710
them right some wrong--

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They love that.

00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:34,290
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,430
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They want to do good.

00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,950
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That is the best feeling in the world.

00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,730
They feel like Superman or Wonder Woman.

00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,190
They're like, let's make this happen.

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,260
This is 10 seconds of my time.

00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,280
I forward an email.

00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,460
But if they can't parse it, they're just gonna, yeah,

00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,220
delete it and get rid of it.

00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,910
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So give them a chance to be awesome.

00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,170
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Super valuable trick.

00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So what happens if you're in a bad

00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,430
company and you try all these things, nothing is--

00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,100
things still are horrible.

00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,277
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you go to Plan B, right.

00:46:57,277 --> 00:47:00,100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Plan B. What is Plan B?

00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, we're gonna talk about Plan B. It

00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,670
takes a little bit of time, but we've got another 45

00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,800
minutes here.

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,200
This is Plan B. Plan B is get the hell out of there.

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,850
Now--

00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,530
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A lot of people don't

00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,425
consider this option.

00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:16,600
That's just funny to me.

00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,620
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, we say this with a little tongue in

00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,170
cheek, and we're trying to be a little funny here.

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,080
But we've been giving these talks since 2007 now--

00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,150
2006, technically, I guess.

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,620
And after these talks, every year someone comes up to us

00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,500
and says, you know, all that stuff you said, it is great.

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,660
But I tried this and I've done that and I've done that.

00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,820
I just can't make anything happen in my company.

00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,970
And last year at IO, this guy came up and he asked me all

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,360
these things.

00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,300
This was two years ago.

00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:41,900
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yep.

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,330
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He said all this stuff.

00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,110
He said what I can do.

00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,930
And I said get the hell out of there.

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,670
I said, update your resume, start focusing your energy

00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,330
into maybe some classes or training you might need--

00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:51,790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Don't be a victim.

00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:52,290
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --or whatever.

00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:52,750
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,160
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But don't be a victim.

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,230
If you can't change or navigate the system, start

00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,720
putting your energy into leaving.

00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,710
Learn your new skills, start a job hunt.

00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,930
I got an email from this guy a couple months ago.

00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,750
And he said, hey, you're the guy that told me to get the

00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,560
hell out of my job two years ago.

00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,020
And I went and took classes.

00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,450
And I am now--

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,090
just got a job offer in Japan as a product manager for like

00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,420
my dream company.

00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,050
So thanks for swearing at me.

00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,620
All right.

00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,610
But this is an--

00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:18,770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Great story.

00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --option.

00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,710
The minute you realize that you can leave, it's incredibly

00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,090
liberating.

00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Empowering, right.

00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,790
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you want to tell Meng's story?

00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,920
Meng has a story about [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,750
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You tell that story.

00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,260
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: OK.

00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,820
So Meng, Chade-Meng Tan, who works at Google,

00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,530
just wrote a book.

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,550
It's called Search Inside Yourself.

00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,640
But he has a blog.

00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,380
And he talks about a lot of really interesting things.

00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,150
And he wrote a post earlier this year that said, every day

00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,460
I go into work and I do the right thing, what I think is

00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,040
the right thing.

00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,560
And then I sit back and wait to get fired.

00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,160
And if I don't get--

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,260
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sounds grim.

00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --fired, then I realize that this is

00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,080
the right company for me to be working at.

00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,950
He said if I do get fired, then I realize the company's

00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,770
done me a favor.

00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,610
It's done us both a favor because I won't be trying to

00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,860
do the wrong thing for them, and they won't be trying to do

00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,830
their own thing for me.

00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,380
Now, I know this is a little bit of an extreme case.

00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,410
And I am very much aware that not everyone has this luxury.

00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:07,680
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But it's a nice

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,410
philosophy to think about.

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,250
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It is a nice philosophy.

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,610
He went on to describe that his dad lived by this

00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,090
philosophy.

00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,560
And every day he would drive home and he would look at the

00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,350
government subsidized housing in the way.

00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,450
And he'd think to himself, if I ever screw up or get fired,

00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,420
that's where I'm going wind up living, as a reminder to

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,090
himself of what he had and what he didn't have.

00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,000
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So there we go.

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,110
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So that's it.

00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Let's talk about-- well,

00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One more thing, I guess.

00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Recapping, I guess.

00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:31,780
Just a few.

00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,380
So remember that companies are made of people, if there's one

00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,530
thing you remember from this talk.

00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:39,710
And being successful as a software engineer means not

00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,050
just being successful with your code base or knowing the

00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,230
latest technologies.

00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,580
It also means learning how to deal with people and how to

00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,650
deal with corporate politics.

00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,050
It's just as important.

00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,540
And it's something, unfortunately, you can only

00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,110
learned through experience, for the most part.

00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,220
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's efficiency, and its

00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:53,880
effectiveness.

00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,940
It's not just about touchy feely, lovey dovey crap.

00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,100
It's about a way to make your stuff go a lot further with a

00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,850
lot less effort.

00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:01,810
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you will be happier--

00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:02,640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you'll be happier.

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --as a result.

00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,030
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, so.

00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,030
But before we wrap up, we've been giving these talks for

00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,420
six years now.

00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,970
You may have seen or heard of some of our talks.

00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,360
They're all available on YouTube.

00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,160
And I think they're going to come in here eventually.

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,905
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So pretty.

00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:17,280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,940
We love the effect.

00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You may have seen us on the internet.

00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,416
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yes.

00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:21,310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So yeah, we have a

00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:21,750
bunch of these talks.

00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And now we have this talk.

00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,840
And so, we're really happy actually to announce--

00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,930
we've never announced this publicly here other then

00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,280
occasionally on our G+ accounts.

00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,160
But, we've written a book that incorporates this and a whole

00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:33,830
bunch of other stuff.

00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,440
It's called Team Geek.

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,360
And it's available.

00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,680
You could pre-order it.

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,730
We won't give you any particular book seller to buy

00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,900
it from, like Amazon.

00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,980
But you could buy it from wherever you like.

00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,950
And you'll find information about this talk as well as

00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:47,900
other stuff in here.

00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,030
But it's all about people aspect of software

00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,380
engineering.

00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It'll be out in a couple of weeks.

00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,450
And so we have little cards, if you're interested.

00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They're at the door.

00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,680
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Are at the door, I suppose.

00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,550
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, thank you, guys.

00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,800
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you very much for your time.

00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:09,540


00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,420
Now, if you want to leave, please feel free to run off.

00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,180
We do have some time for Q&A. We have two microphones here.

00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Please step up to a mic--

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,580
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, please step up.

00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --if you have questions.

00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,700
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Anything we can clarify.

00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,970
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yep.

00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Otherwise, we'll be hanging around here.

00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:22,600
Any questions?

00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,430
Let's see if anybody hits the mics, or if we

00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,130
scared everyone away.

00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:27,890
Here comes someone.

00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:28,560
First question.

00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,370
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Hello.

00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,640
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,240
A little quick background.

00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,360
I work a Fortune 10 company.

00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,460
It has a half a million employees.

00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:37,890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right.

00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,360
MALE SPEAKER: And one of the big things that we do is--

00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,900
like you said, perception is 9/10, and it's almost 10/10 in

00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,860
some points.

00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:50,180
And I've seen very technical engineers work up the ladder

00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,250
through hard work and a lot of perception because they

00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,150
understood the climate very well.

00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,430
But then when they got to a certain level, they began to

00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,710
lose some of that thing that made them magical.

00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,760
Having the technical people in the top level still be

00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,850
technical and still understand, they get lost in

00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,030
spreadsheets and finance records and whatnot.

00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,930
So you being technical managers, how

00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,320
did you keep that?

00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I think to some degree, we're lucky at

00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,350
Google, which is a rare thing.

00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,970
They actually have two different ladders, one for

00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,460
engineering and one for engineering management.

00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,780
And they do not cross the ladders.

00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,430
And they never force anyone to move from one ladder to

00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,470
another, which is unusual.

00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,170
Typically, in a usual company, the best engineer climbs up

00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:30,570
the ladder.

00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,250
And then in order to advance, they have to become a manager.

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:33,720
And now you've--

00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,030
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Which is a terrible idea.

00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --lost the world's best engineer, and

00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,190
you've gained the world's worst manager.

00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,550
It's awful.

00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And then that engineer usually leaves.

00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,120
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,360
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I think we're immune from that a

00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,470
little bit.

00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,620
But I think there's always some element of it.

00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,160
And to some extent, you can push it off.

00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,730
To some extent, you can navigate around it.

00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,040
But it's very tricky.

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,610
It really is.

00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,510
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's an argument for focusing on

00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,200
social skills explicitly and political navigation, not just

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,650
relying on your technical expertise and hoping for a

00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,190
meritocracy.

00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:06,920
I mean, it's an argument, I suppose, that something they

00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,220
need to think about and focus on as an actual activity.

00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,690
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,230
Thank you.

00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,720
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,100
Next, please.

00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,410
MALE SPEAKER: You touched on a few things in

00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,820
your talk about this.

00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,380
But I was wondering if you have some specific

00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,950
recommendations for staying sane when you're managing a

00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,940
satellite office at a large company?

00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,020
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Geographical distribution.

00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:27,330
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a tricky--

00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,680
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Other than liberal

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,273
applications of alcohol?

00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,790
No, kidding.

00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,320
That's a really good question.

00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,810
Are you talking about avoiding the need to have to travel all

00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,330
the darn time or--?

00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,010
MALE SPEAKER: Balancing the travel, not going stir crazy,

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,134
staying connected.

00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:44,970
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That's interesting.

00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,590
MALE SPEAKER: You guys are familiar with this challenge.

00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, yeah, we about this in the

00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,470
book a little bit.

00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,690
One of the things that we find really useful--

00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,340
I mean, the reason a lot of companies like Google, for

00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,450
example, is they like people to be geographically centered

00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,960
in one place because there's so much value in

00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,330
face time, in having--

00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,900
just being able to swivel around in your chair and ask

00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,550
the right person right next to you a question as opposed to

00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,870
sending them an email or getting on

00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,020
the phone or whatever.

00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,200
You want the friction to be as low as possible.

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,100
One way we have found working on distributed teams-- we've

00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,420
been in that situation--

00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,850
is to actually have, like, a continuous chatroom, like IRC

00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:22,150
in particular.

00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,150
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One of my teams has

00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,695
a Chromebook actually--

00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:26,820
talk about IRC first, then we'll go on.

00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, IRC, right-- for those people

00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,280
who remember what it is--

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,910
it's an actual group chat system designed for group

00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,660
chat, not IM with some party feature stapled on.

00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,260
It's noticeably different.

00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,740
Everybody would literally just hang out in an IRC chat room

00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,140
all day long, corner of their screen dedicated to it.

00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,720
And that became--

00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,750
for distributed team working in three different offices--

00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,700
that became our substitute sit in a circle, swivel all our

00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,210
chairs around to talk to each other.

00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,070
You could fire a question in there any time.

00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,020
Everybody would see it.

00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,230
Everybody would reply.

00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,710
And it creates, partially, that allusion of being in the

00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,510
same room with everybody.

00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,510
It really helps.

00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,470
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One of my teams, actually, they use a

00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,120
lot of chat.

00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,040
But I gave them a Chromebook.

00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,660
And they set it up between two of the engineers.

00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:16,630
And VC Chromebook to the other engineer in the remote office.

00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,770
And they had that up pretty much half the day or so as a

00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,550
way to just quickly grab a question or--

00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,060
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It is strange to just see a floating

00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,940
head in the middle of a bullpen.

00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,280
Like, is that your other teammate?

00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,460
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: When people are coding, they look very

00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,600
angry most of the time.

00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,270
But you have to use everything in your power to do that.

00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,890
And the fact of the matter is is that the people, the

00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,260
engineers who are in the remote office-- and having

00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,780
been in the remote office for many, many years--

00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,050
it takes more work.

00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,500
It takes more effort to get where you're going.

00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
And the advantage of that is you get to

00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,640
live where you want.

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,210
So--

00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,820
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's a tradeoff.

00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,500
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a tradeoff.

00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,100
And we've made that tradeoff.

00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,470
And we've built an engineering office in Chicago with the

00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,770
help of a lot of other people.

00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,165
But it's never friction-free and 100%.

00:55:59,165 --> 00:56:01,030
And you're still gonna have to get on a plane once in awhile.

00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:01,380
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,700
We're almost out of time here.

00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,160
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Almost out of time?

00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,200
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Want to do one more question?

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,680
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One last question?

00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,780
Anyone?

00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,243
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We'll go out in the hall, if you guys

00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:08,720
want to ask more questions.

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:08,880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,500
We'll head out in the hall and talk some more.

00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,090
But thanks a lot, guys.

00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:11,150
Appreciate it.

00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Thank you.
