my title of the talk is app development

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,400
with react native and export so what

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,170
actually is react native on their

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,360
homepage they state that with react

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,150
native you don't build a mobile app or a

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,240
hybrid app but rather you build a real

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,779
app that's Indian in this screen shape

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,060
from an app which was built with

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:28,260
Objective C Java or more recently Swift

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,359
and Kotlin so the way to us this is by

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,630
using the same fundamental UI building

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,460
blocks as regular iOS and Android apps

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:42,149
and you built this UI building blocks

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,340
together using rect and JavaScript so

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,850
when you download an app and react

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,520
native app on your device and started

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,129
the UI elements you see are the same one

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,800
which are used by native developers so

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,730
there is no html5 rendered was alone the

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,280
real native components and the way this

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,019
works in react native is that in

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,880
addition in addition to the native

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,070
threat which is created in area app

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,369
there's also a child script thread

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,979
started and there is a bridge which

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,430
communicates between these two threads

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,960
so the core of react native is actually

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,110
the bridge which handles the

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,530
communication so for example if you get

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,600
a touch event on your app this touch

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,970
event is recognized by the native thread

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,950
and communicates this event to the

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,619
JavaScript thread which can run some

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,140
business logic and communicates back to

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:42,240
the native thread about what to render

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,240
so as a small example here's a react

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,939
component and it consists of a scroll

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,970
view an image tag in a text tag but what

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,430
you will see on your app is actually if

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,040
you're on iOS you will have a UI scroll

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,079
view which you would have used as an iOS

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,930
developer as well and on Android you

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,840
would have you would get or you get and

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,360
a native Android scoff you and the same

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,340
goes for that image component and the

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,740
text component and so on so what is X

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,340
button expo is

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,480
open-source tool chain which helps you

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:25,230
build your react native apps and has

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,650
some benefits for example it has support

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,290
for iOS and Android without a separate

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,810
build process to set up so if you don't

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:38,100
use Expo you would have to install

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:41,250
Android studio or Xcode on your device

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,920
on your coding device and set up the

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,780
build process with a expo that's taken

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,850
care of so you don't have to install

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,430
android studio xcode and you don't have

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,400
to set up this build process you also

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,710
have instant updates so once you've

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,080
published your apps and tabs are in the

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,650
App Store you don't have to resubmit

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,870
your apps to the App Store you just yeah

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,980
add a feature to the app or a bug fix

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:11,010
and then you say publish and it's

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,590
uploaded in the in the cloud and users

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,480
who open the app get a new bundle from

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,740
the Scout download it to their app and

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,330
they have the new code instantly and

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,580
expose gives you some some basic

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,120
functionalities such as a price to

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,000
access the contacts the gallery or the

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,740
camera on your phone however the big

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
drawback on the exploits that you can

00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,210
use other native models so if you want

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,760
to write your own native model in Swift

00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,820
or Kotlin or you want to use a library

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,850
you can do this with expo what you have

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,160
to do then is you have to detach then

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,510
you lose some of the pen it fits so then

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,770
you would have to set up your build

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,200
process for example but yeah so there's

00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,170
a solution so if you need to use a

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:04,610
native model you have to detach and you

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:07,740
can yeah go further all right so that's

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:11,220
for the talk and now I want to scaffold

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:15,440
a project and you want and show you how

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,440
easily it is actually

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,509
so I already prepared workshop it's

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,229
available on github and I will go to the

00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:33,220
readme we have written down the steps

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:36,370
with which ya with whom you can set up

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,410
and you see app so the first part you

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,070
have to do is if you haven't done that

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:52,330
is to install install the xposed CLI and

00:04:42,070 --> 00:05:07,090
you will have sorry oh I'm not a Windows

00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:13,630
user actually but it's ok I it popped in

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:22,060
the other message it still worked and

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:24,820
here as well ok so the first step is to

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,800
install the expo CLI which have already

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,930
done because our youth Expo on this

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,750
laptop and the second step would be to

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,440
install a node but you also have to do

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,349
this once and then you can start by

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:46,810
creating a new project by saying Expo

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:50,229
and in it so this can take a few seconds

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:53,800
and then it will ask us to choose a

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,960
project name and if you want to use a

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,550
blank project or if you want to use a

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,940
project which already has navigation

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,430
built in so you can also choose the

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,669
second project and you already have a

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,440
app which has navigation built in and

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,610
you have to fuse where you can switch

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,680
from one to another

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:20,240
however for this project we will start

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:32,030
with a blank screen project oh okay

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:32,030
okay this that's the template question

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:40,139
so now it's scaffolding the project

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:46,470
which takes at some time and in the

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:50,400
meantime I will go further here so we've

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,889
already seated into the folder and and

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:59,870
now we have to wait until it's ready

00:06:52,889 --> 00:07:06,349
with the scaffolding in addition I will

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,349
install some node modules yeah

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,580
so normally when I do some JavaScript

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,750
projects always at typescript because it

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:27,740
gives me some benefits and I really

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:41,150
don't think there are any big draw dance

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:46,040
to this can I copy this copy it copy and

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:55,700
paste okay and I also will add the

00:07:46,040 --> 00:08:00,170
Taipings here yeah okay so the

00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:06,350
scaffolding is done and I can now start

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:09,950
the app so this takes also a minute or

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,710
two minutes and what we get then is a

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:16,220
bar code on this command line window

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:20,870
which you can scan with our expo app

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:23,900
which from our device so I've already

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:31,900
set up I've also set up screen mirroring

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:34,850
here okay

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:39,590
silver works and there's this Expo app

00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:43,729
on the top left and we can open this app

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:53,200
and we already got the bar code here

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:53,200
which is now very big okay

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,070
there's another window which popped up

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:04,450
so when you start the expo CLI it prints

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,700
out the barcode on the command line but

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,670
you also get this window here where you

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,140
see some console.log statements and

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,570
there's also this power called and

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:21,580
they're now on my device I can scan this

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:25,540
barcode and it starts building the

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,300
project so this also takes one minute

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,900
for a new project and once you build it

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,090
it does only build it changes and that's

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,180
a lot faster than so we already see that

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,040
it's working it takes some time now and

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,510
then we'll see the project which we've

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,510
just scaffold it

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,779
I also can start my coding editor now

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:17,120
it's really taking up some resources our

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:23,449
demo app and we have here our episode GS

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:25,189
file we have one few reps I want X

00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:28,459
component revved from a few component

00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:30,620
and it just says open up up chairs to

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:33,709
start working on your app so that's what

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:43,509
we should see here after the build is

00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:43,509
complete so until that's finished sorry

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,480
yeah I think I can do that

00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,480
a

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,970
talk

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,960
I think this

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,660
I know it's working yet

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,280
but up

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,720
yeah okay

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:41,179
so in the in the meantime our app built

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:47,989
and now we see this this text component

00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:53,899
on our phone so and if we decide to add

00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:57,259
some text here then we see the result of

00:11:53,899 --> 00:12:05,629
this change more or less immediately on

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:12,559
our phone so as a next step I was going

00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:15,949
to add typescript and we've already

00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:19,009
installed the dependencies for that so

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:22,660
every typescript project has a TS config

00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,660
dot JSON file

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:41,620
which I will add here enter this and in

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:46,950
addition I have to after my apt or

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:50,490
chasing file and state that this GS mt6

00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:55,110
as of files with TSM t6 attention

00:12:50,490 --> 00:13:01,770
extension should be transformed so

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,770
that's here and I can just copy this and

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:09,820
now as a next step I can create my first

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,750
reaction ativ component written in

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:20,320
typescript so I will create a source

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:22,660
folder for this case F dot t6 copy this

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:28,780
it's it's again just a text view wrap

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:33,370
from a few component and the last step

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:38,080
to do is update the Epcot GS file so

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,760
that it imports the other app so that's

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,240
it

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,340
otherwise I now see an error message I

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,830
think that was too much adding all these

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:58,480
packages and updating the config files

00:13:50,830 --> 00:14:02,370
so we just restarted so there's a

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,370
process for setting up typescript

00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:24,569
I think I've installed no models into

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:24,569
the wrong folder so once again

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:39,209
so once that's finished it should work

00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:41,279
and then okay and then as a next step I

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:44,119
want to add to react navigation so what

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,529
we then will have done is two fuels and

00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:48,359
we will see how these two fuse

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:53,040
communicate with each other with each

00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:58,579
other so for this I also have to install

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:01,139
an old package so this is just one

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,910
navigation error I used react navigation

00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,359
but there are other navigation libraries

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:10,739
out there such as retro out of flux and

00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:19,619
a few others but this one is pretty nice

00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:23,699
so I will use it here as well okay some

00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:27,480
advertisement so we're now at this

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:30,540
dependency as well and for the last

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,209
point of my presentation I will add my

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,819
bigs for State handling and I will add

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:42,350
this dependency here as well now because

00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:42,350
then we've done the installation part

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:55,790
okay the export project is back up and

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,790
running so we see our up here

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,570
I think I have to scan it again you know

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,260
it's working again so I don't know why

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,260
it lost connectivity

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,310
so in order to use react native what I

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:32,589
did was to import the create stack

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:35,290
navigator from this library and in this

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,630
episode a six file I make a default

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,329
export of the skirt steak navigator and

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,769
there's the first route I set home to

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,860
home screen and home screen is this

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:49,120
component above which just wraps a text

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:52,300
component with home screen on it and as

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:58,450
a next step I can add a second component

00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:01,500
and set up navigation between to those

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,500
two components

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,209
so we see that we now have two routes

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,429
the home screen and the title screen and

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,110
as the initial router set the home

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:28,220
screen so when the app first starts it

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,820
chooses the home screen as default

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:38,059
screen and when we take a look at the

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:41,530
home screen there's an issue here I need

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,530
to import this as well

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,930
we have the same component as before but

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,720
now we also have this navigation options

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,250
so when you use react navigation you

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,230
always have the static navigation

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,690
options and for the home screen I set

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,160
the header to now because I don't want

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,040
to have this header on the home screen

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,490
component and in addition what I did was

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,690
an on press Handler on a button which

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:18,300
navigates me to the details screen and

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:21,060
on this detail screen component I want

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,740
to have this navigation bar and I want

00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,140
to have a title on it that's why I set

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,420
the title to title screen and I also

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,180
added a button which brings me back to

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,720
the component where I came from so in

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:37,950
this case this go back relevant

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,200
references to the home screen and now if

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,020
we take a look at the app we have the

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,150
home screen now and if I touch the

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,690
pattern call to detail screen the teeter

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:51,870
screen pops up and if I go back to the

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,870
home screen by pressing the button it

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:58,310
says go back and unpack there and also

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:03,810
can use this back button up and left

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:08,520
with this nice effect and yep now we

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:12,350
have two components and a navigation so

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:18,690
in addition to this I also like to use

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:20,970
motifs for state handling so let's say

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,760
you have two components and you want to

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,340
exchange information between two between

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,800
those two components but you can't or

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,470
you don't want to use props then you can

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,480
set up a state and both component

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:39,390
components interact with this one state

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,180
so to do this I just have to add

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:45,960
experimental decorators because mopix is

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:49,340
working with decorators and they're

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,340
still experimental

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,810
and

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:08,610
yeah then I can set up a store so just

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,610
copy this

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,549
and

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,549
import

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,360
okay it still knows don't know still

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,360
don't know more weeks

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:52,940
I thought I already installed it okay

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,940
I haven't can't add more weeks

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,850
so I have to install two packages one is

00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:10,009
just demo big store and the other is

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,169
depending to do react library and right

00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:14,090
now more pics is at version 5 but

00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,730
version 5 thousand of workers react

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:28,580
native that's why I installed version

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:32,960
4.3 point 1 so and then I want to have a

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,909
store where I just save a color so what

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,769
I want to achieve is that on the teacher

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,389
screen you can enter a color and this

00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,549
color should be the background color of

00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:42,799
the home screen and in order to

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,240
communicate from the detail screen to

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,869
the home screen in this color I have to

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,419
store with just one variable color and

00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:54,409
by default it's set to white and I also

00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:56,269
have a set color function which can be

00:21:54,409 --> 00:22:00,289
called trigger

00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:04,220
sorry which can be called poly

00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:11,570
components to set the color and here I

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:14,860
create one instance of this store so

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,860
that's now installed

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,500
once again this is sure

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:37,520
normally it works good I don't know how

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,520
it does not - so right now yeah probably

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:49,800
okay so unten the way to interact with

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,250
the stories from the title screen I will

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:57,840
have an unchanged text event where I set

00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:01,530
the store sorry okay on step back I have

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,220
this state on the title screen component

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:08,010
which gets in your last with the color

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,560
which is stored in the store right now

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,990
so in this case it's white and then all

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,740
that on change text handler I will

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,390
update the state of the component and

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,730
finally when you hit the submit button

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:24,210
[Music]

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,650
the color will be submitted so that's I

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,950
think that's missing here and this is

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:32,900
scripture so I'll walk you through the

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,900
final source code because it's the same

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,350
row

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:50,090
so we have to store above yeah we have

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:54,330
to store which I already explained and

00:23:50,090 --> 00:24:00,799
in the title screen we have our state

00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:04,440
which accesses reach the stork folder

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,590
and then we have this text input

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,289
component and there we can set a new

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:13,950
color and when we press the button the

00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:17,580
submit button the new color is written

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,470
to the store so we call here to set

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,950
color State the color is written to the

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,370
store and then we navigate back to the

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,340
home screen

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,110
and on the home screen the only things

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,409
that changed is we have a background

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:38,779
color now which again reach the color

00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:44,899
from the store so that's the final app I

00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:44,899
hope it will start again

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,790
and I think that's fine I think it's a

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,590
nice setup for a small app so you have

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,870
to navigation part and you have a store

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:10,610
with which you can communicate between

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:13,480
components and that's all you need to

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,480
get started basically

00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,830
so

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:55,490
so I hope this will start compiling

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:55,490
again at 0%

00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:01,290
let's see but in the mean time so the

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,929
last part you normally want to do is you

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:07,080
want to publish app and how you can do

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,210
this in Expo is to at this description

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,160
to the application file so you need one

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:15,929
for iOS and you would need one for

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,610
Android so we have copied this the

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:27,360
script descriptions of the apt of

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:33,440
chasing fire let's say at the end i OS

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:37,530
is already here we'll write this and

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:41,490
then on our command line we can say

00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:44,820
export build and then iOS for iOS or

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:47,880
Android so Android and this will give us

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:54,059
the apk file for the Android app or the

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:57,179
ePub file for the iOS version and we are

00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:59,760
with this final package we can go to the

00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:05,429
app stores upload it there and then it's

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:12,929
published so that's the way we can work

00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:15,530
with expo it looks like it asmath want

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,530
to work again

00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:35,359
yep I give it one last try

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,230
so if it does not work you can check it

00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:00,070
out on github and you can play through

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:04,590
the workshop by yourself and I think it

00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,590
will work better than here in this setup

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,880
I think that's always a problem with

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,390
live coding and having devices connected

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,390
and so on

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:41,320
it does not look so what we would get is

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,060
a detail screen where we can enter the

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,890
color we would press the button said

00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,350
Cora we would go back to the app screen

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,540
and the app screen would be for example

00:28:47,350 --> 00:29:03,390
in orange the background color so that

00:28:49,540 --> 00:29:03,390
would be the app oh happy I'm sorry I

00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:13,960
think they had the important parts it

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,200
works so we we saw how we can scan the

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,930
app how the app does look on your phone

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,830
and how you can interact with it and

00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:25,150
yeah that's what I wanted to show you

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:29,590
said that the last part in of work but I

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:31,030
don't think it's that set okay so thank

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,630
you

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,630
