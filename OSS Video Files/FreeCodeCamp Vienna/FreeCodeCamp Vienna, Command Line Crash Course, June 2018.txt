welcome everyone thank you for having me

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,770
my name is Robert Royston I'm gonna talk

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,150
today about command line by show hands

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,550
those of you honestly who don't know

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,670
what the command line is just show your

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,890
hand cool - nice two and a half no ha ha

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,340
that was a joke

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,890
ok cool so this is meant to be it looks

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,680
exhaustive on the list and I'm not sure

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,619
how long we'll take let me check the

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,410
time okay but I don't think it'll be as

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,600
exhaustive as it looks like we'll cover

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,070
some things that I used on a by daily

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,730
basis

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,110
and we'll go in to short detail of what

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,290
- come on - and maybe why you should use

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,290
it

00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,570
I'll give you actually a little bit of

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,370
info at the end about how I made these

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,559
slides because that's an interesting

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,859
story they look a bit different from the

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,190
slides I've had recently so I'll get to

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,010
that but yeah my name is roblox Wilson

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,150
you can find me on all on most things as

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,350
at Rob Axelson coincidentally I also

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,479
have everywhere on all the things so I'm

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,090
at on all the things at on all the

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,420
things but those are mainly elias's for

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,200
now

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,000
Rob axelsson is where I actually am I'm

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,009
a self-taught developer like we talked

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,250
about earlier I'm a speaker a meetup

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,100
organizer on the community enthusiast

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,049
and then there's a long sentence there

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,840
but all I want to say is that I love it

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,290
when just like today one code and people

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,829
come together and I love to get to know

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,079
people how people learn to code and be

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:51,840
and be amongst other geeks and code

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,820
enthusiasts awesome so as I said earlier

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,570
this is talk is by no means meant to be

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,009
exhaustive and I hope that if you could

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,479
realize something at part of the talk

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,060
you're like oh but he should mention

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,820
this or that's wrong or whatever

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,360
feel free to mention it to me afterwards

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,760
or even better commit a pull request

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
because the talks are already on the

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,270
talk slides are already

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,220
online and this is meant to be mainly

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,870
for beginners people that haven't really

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,570
opened a terminal or the command line

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,140
before or if you're a little bit

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:30,420
familiar but you know you like not sure

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,120
why you should use the command line more

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,670
or you a bit too scared or you're like

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,040
okay now's the time to maybe get better

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:45,180
at this I'm gonna try and give you a

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:47,340
jump start yeah one thing that I think

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,440
we should make clear first is in terms

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,870
of the command line the command line is

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,300
just the opposite or an alternative to

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,370
the GUI the graphical interface that you

00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,500
used to use to do stuff on your computer

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,660
you might go to YouTube to watch videos

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,150
you can also download YouTube videos

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,380
from the command line with commands for

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,150
example you might like to use graphical

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,030
tools when you are committing your

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,410
source code meaning you're creating some

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,540
code or you're programming something and

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,520
you have a visual tool that helps you

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,950
keep track of all of that you can do

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,170
that from the command line you can play

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,580
games from the command line you can do

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,489
all sorts of things but for me it's

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,239
mainly a way of being more productive

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:36,570
and as it becomes muscle memory it also

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,220
feels like um it looks to others like

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm having magical powers and it kind of

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,880
feels like that sometimes as well

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,780
because if you make the effort and it

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,090
becomes part of your routine there is an

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,380
initial steep learning curve for sure

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,300
depending on what you're using the

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,739
command line for but if you're willing

00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,600
to give it that give that an effort you

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,709
will benefit from it and also some of

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,260
this is stuff that you will eventually

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,230
have to know as a developer normally if

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,989
you are using an IDE or you're any

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,030
company where you have like IntelliJ or

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,680
some IDE which does almost everything

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,450
you just have some terminal inside the

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,519
IDE okay maybe you won't really have to

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,859
know so much but at some point it will

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,019
only benefit any developer or programmer

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,850
to know some stuff about the command

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,380
line and some of the stuff we're sharing

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,820
today will just be basic stuff that will

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,120
help you but if you don't know it from

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,120
before

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,520
come on like give me many things there

00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:32,889
is a command line in Windows I won't go

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,270
into that unless you install what's it

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,569
called bash for Windows or something

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:42,030
like this where you get basically Linux

00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:48,250
interface in Windows you will sorry

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:52,599
sequin okay Coco and you also benefit

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,909
from this talk with some disk land of

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,169
disclaimers with some exceptions most of

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,229
this stuff will work on Mac as well

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,779
because Mac is also a UNIX based BSD

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:05,050
based I just included some stuff mainly

00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:09,819
from Wikipedia here in terms of what

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:12,159
UNIX is but it is in essence an

00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,599
operating system that there are current

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,909
operating systems that are derived from

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,229
it's a simplification but as all you

00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,439
need to know and one thing to mention

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:24,340
which we won't go into depth on today

00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:28,990
but which you might notice later on is

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,690
that UNIX has a philosophy of having

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,699
modules for everything and every program

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,159
or tools should be really good at what

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,199
it does and then it can be chained or

00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:40,419
combined with other commands or tools

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,849
and they together will do the job really

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,039
brilliantly for you I won't go into any

00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:49,919
advanced examples but if you're

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,909
interested in that kind of way of yeah

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,289
controlling your computer from the color

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:58,180
online and benefiting from that kind of

00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:03,370
philosophy that's a whole different talk

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,199
topic but it's just nice to know not so

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,719
much about bash other than that we will

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,069
at the end I'll go through some a little

00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:13,779
bit of demo feel free to save questions

00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,789
to the end because of the talk is not so

00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,569
easy to with the recording it's not so

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:24,789
easy to have a questions live so please

00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:27,009
keep them in mind bash is a shell and

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,449
command language meaning the command

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,389
line that you get up on Linux or Mac

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,419
will be bash based and the commands you

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,520
give outside of using a tool or a

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,169
certain command with some options those

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,270
will be bash commands

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:43,870
it's called born again shell and it's

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:48,440
some yeah

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,910
enough said there's a great resource if

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,710
you want to go into how to customize

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,380
your bash and make your command like

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,509
line look different or program and bash

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,880
whatever there's a great github resource

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,910
which called awesome bash where there's

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,979
tons of resources these commands that

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,220
I've listed here control our control a

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,210
control a control L and clear those are

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,130
the ones that will make you the most

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,150
productive in terms of using bash those

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,610
are eccentric meaning control art takes

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,440
up all the previous it has the history

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,610
your bash history all the commands you

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,530
previously have done in the command line

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,660
I think by default of the thousand last

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,520
commands then you can basically search

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,620
in them as you start control art and

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,509
start typing out it'll give you the last

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,889
command and then a history of the

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,289
previous commands you've done that

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:38,449
started with the same thing control a

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,979
makes you jump to the front of the line

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,650
you're on and control e to the end

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,570
feel free to code along or do this but

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,930
the slides are also online so you don't

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,789
have to write down something control L

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,919
is the same as clear it clears the

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,870
screen you can also write clear just

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,740
write clear enter and it does the same

00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:02,210
job before we start just know that a

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,960
good habit to get from the start is the

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,909
man pages meaning most every for example

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,740
Linux tool command-line tool will have a

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:15,889
manual page man page and you can

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,780
normally just do man and space and the

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,699
programmer tool that you are wanting to

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,199
move get more information on so we

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,479
talked about bash you can even do man

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,539
bash and you'll get tons of information

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,969
starts with a title description example

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,680
or the syntax and it gives you the

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:33,440
options and maybe some examples for

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,789
those options options will get a little

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,589
bit into later but that's not really

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,419
stuff you have to get so familiar with

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:44,420
just to get familiar with the command

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:47,959
line get as we talked about earlier with

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:52,550
github that's a version control system

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,350
and the most popular one to date by far

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,829
this is where you keep track of all the

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,689
versions of the programs you're right if

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,839
you code something you might do

00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:05,089
something today you put you commit it

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,619
meaning you save it you save it locally

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,449
but you can also choose to save it for

00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:10,519
example at github or a private

00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,019
repositories is only available for you

00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,689
but you know that if your computer

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,040
crashes it's still there you can pull it

00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,929
down this also makes it easier to

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,749
contribute to collaborate with other

00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,579
people so that you can push your code

00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:25,730
they can take that code down to make

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:27,799
changes and simplify it but that's part

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,569
of what this tool does and all this you

00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,759
can do from the command line sometimes

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,559
you start with getting it there's a lot

00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,149
of code here will go through commands

00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,670
here will go two of those some of the

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,100
things together later but and I know a

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,949
lot of this is just throwing stuff at

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,170
you and it might be Wow but I my goal

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,489
Park list if you remember 10% of these

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,040
things and then you're in a situation

00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:52,429
we're like I think I can do that's

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,619
hopefully helpful getting it you're

00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:56,149
starting a new project often if you're

00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:57,679
starting to learning to code you do git

00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,649
clone instead because you're putting

00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,999
down someone else's code then you

00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,059
normally get familiar with git status

00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:06,379
and hit add git status shows you really

00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:08,119
good overview and often gives you

00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,439
suggestions about exactly what you

00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:14,779
should do in that case git add lets you

00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:17,019
add new files or change the files that

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,549
have been changed you add them to the

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,910
stage the environment but let's not get

00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:25,939
into get specifics and get commits that

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,369
command means that you are storing the

00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,290
new version of your source code with a

00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:32,240
message that it should be descriptive of

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,279
what it does and git push it's when

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:40,339
you're pushing it to locally or normally

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,100
a remote place where the code lives but

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,069
these are the codes that you like 80% of

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:51,290
your normal working day would get unless

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:53,989
you have like an advanced workflow in

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:58,540
your company or with your you know open

00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:58,540
source project that gets you very far

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,360
maybe to give some context if I do this

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,550
I have a terminal window here that I use

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,949
that is a drop-down we can show you how

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,990
to open one normally on Linux afterwards

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:12,490
when I talk about the command line this

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:18,279
is what I'm talking about just to give

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:19,990
some visuals if it was unclear then we

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,899
can create files and directories from

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,660
the command line the easiest way is the

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,059
touch command again if you're curious to

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,850
give some more context I can do man

00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:34,329
touch and it gives me information about

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,459
what this command does for me right so

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:39,279
it changes the file timestamps but we

00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:41,110
can use it to create files it has

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,660
options as you see here it has the

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,490
description and it has the options and

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,819
it gives us information about what they

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:51,339
do and it says you need to touch and you

00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:55,439
can do an option that's optional but you

00:11:51,339 --> 00:12:02,259
need a file name yeah

00:11:55,439 --> 00:12:03,939
so if we touch a file it's a file

00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,920
doesn't exist before it creates the file

00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:10,300
is an empty file there's like no bits

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,829
it's like it's just an empty file and

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,540
that's helpful sometimes but sometimes

00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,800
you want to create a file because you

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,660
already know what you want to put in it

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,629
so from the command line you can use

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,699
bash syntax of echoing out and then in

00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:25,149
strings whatever is going to be there

00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:28,029
and then you direct it to that file that

00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:30,910
file will then have that content there

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,860
are text editing tools in your command

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,019
line the simplest one probably being nah

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,459
no because it you can follow

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,559
instructions and stuff we'll get to

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,930
another one later so you can also just

00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,220
do nano file tree and then you're

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,439
opening your file and then you get

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,420
instructions on how to save it after you

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:51,100
put some information into the file it's

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,660
also important to note differences but I

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,579
mentioned that this one over writes

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,839
everything in a file and this one lets

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,790
you always a pen so if there is

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,959
something already existing in file too

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,490
this means that this will be added to it

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,339
then I won't go into detail today but

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,769
it's more powerful editor than Nano some

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:12,860
people myself included use it to program

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,750
all day long so it can be a fully

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,360
functional and more than enough

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,960
productive IDE for you if you want a

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:25,520
program to make a directory you use make

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:28,400
death m'kay dr d ir and one thing you'll

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,890
use more often if that anything more

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,790
than that is the p up flag the p option

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,560
which just lets you make more than one

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,880
directory at once because if you try

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,380
without the flag it'll say that

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,430
directory you want to create a directory

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,770
in so it doesn't exist yeah and now that

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,050
we've created and directories and files

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,480
we maybe want to have a look at them

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,900
so LS gives us a simple overview of

00:13:50,480 --> 00:14:01,430
where we are and what files are

00:13:52,900 --> 00:14:03,410
available and LS again with options so

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:07,150
you see here is an example of some tools

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:10,640
lets you have options or flags like la

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,930
lah together some of them enforce you to

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,510
have a dash in front of all of them

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,480
there is a bit of inconsistency between

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,160
commands and tools unfortunately so it's

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
good again to check the main pages if

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,430
there's one thing you remember today

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,510
from this talk if you get confused to

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,100
the command line there's something

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,840
you're supposed to use just to man

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,360
before the command and see what happens

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,730
you can get a lot on just by looking in

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,920
the local information you have available

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,140
for you

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,440
lah is an example of list them not just

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:42,320
in a row but as a list list the files as

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,190
a list LS lists all the file in your

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:51,830
current directory

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:55,760
a thank you lists all a for all and H is

00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:58,610
human readable so if you get sizes in

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,080
bits and you like how many megabits or

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:07,490
whatever is that then you can use that

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,380
up CD dot dot when you are already - no

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,390
sorry we go into this directory so we

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,010
have a directory my dear hello we can do

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,590
either CD my dear

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:18,650
then again CD hello or we can do the

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:22,010
forward slash because it's my hello is a

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,260
directory in my dear and once we're in

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,620
there we use the dot dot to go one

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,050
directory back

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,500
and we can do Slashdot to go to

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,970
directories back or to levels and then

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,580
we can do that infinite like as many

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,310
times as we have like there are some

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,930
file system limitations I think but I

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,830
don't think you'll run into them I think

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,990
it's more long filenames find it's the

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,300
simplest command or that is always there

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,790
to find a file so forward slash will

00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,120
find everything in your computer and the

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:57,090
name denotes what you're looking for us

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,190
the name and the dot is from your

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,500
current directory and downwards or up

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:05,270
yeah

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,950
downwards upwards whatever I don't know

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,910
at least inside that directory and all

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,400
the directories inside that directory

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,260
and one thing I maybe should put a

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,970
resource here but if you want to install

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,570
a tool that makes your life easier in

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:24,420
terms of find just install ACK or and

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,820
help me we might remember this you can

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,250
also do FCF which is a fuzzy finder

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,040
which you can replace the control our

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,620
with this and it's even more powerful in

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,510
terms of finding not just your history

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:42,240
but there's also other combinations of

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:44,520
stuff we can find based on file name to

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,050
confuse you less fuzzy finder just means

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,230
you don't even have to type out the full

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,950
name you can like if something is cat

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,990
pick I can write CT PC and because that

00:16:52,950 --> 00:17:00,600
filename contains those I can do quicker

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:02,760
like a fuzzy search manipulating files I

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,680
will get to some examples afterwards

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,720
it's getting really tough now but bear

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,390
with me getting back to the touch

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,020
command if you do the option D you can

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,610
you can specify actually now we don't

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,620
want to create a file we want to take an

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,630
existing file and we want to get it give

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,459
it a new timestamp meaning we created it

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,470
four weeks ago but for some odd reason

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,240
we want to make it appear that we

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,370
created it two days two hours ago

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,380
so then you can just specify a file and

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,230
you can do touch with the flag D for a

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,330
date stamp I think and then you can even

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:36,000
specify in like clear tags two hours ago

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,190
and you can also do date format and then

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,390
the file you want to change and then in

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,190
like both

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,050
the next or if you copy to Windows it'll

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,500
appear as if it was created or know as

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:52,920
if that was it last time it was edited

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,300
modified RM removes the file RM don't

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,920
play too much with the RM if you don't

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,830
know what to do you can do stuff like RM

00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,750
RF which removes enforces and doesn't

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,340
don't ask you for confirmation then you

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,080
can do the forward slash like we used to

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,120
looked at earlier the whole computer and

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,760
then you have a you're gonna have a good

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,850
time but our I'm on its own specifying

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:17,670
one specific file unless using asterisks

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:19,470
should be fine manipulating files we had

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:25,050
that in the previous slide but you can

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:27,420
then with this redirect you can only

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,090
append so you're updating this file to

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,410
have a newline with more content again

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,200
now I know it's useful if you want to

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,900
change files you can change the file

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,030
name with just MD which is its own again

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,190
you know UNIX philosophy MV does one job

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,050
really good it's good at moving files

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,940
changing names doing that stuff really

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,040
good that's what it does it's always

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,430
there for you man and V you get all the

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,800
options so you move it and then you can

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:56,340
change the name so the existing name and

00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,140
the new name you can copy a file so this

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,540
would move it file to would be gone and

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,570
file a new name would be their copy

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,490
would then copy this one and copied into

00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,880
file tree and both of them then exist

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,410
and a nice trick if you want to if you

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,730
do backups and you often like oh yeah I

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,920
just want to backup this file and change

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,670
it like config files or whatever you can

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,410
do copy file too and then you do some

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,150
don't quote me on this but I think this

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:25,260
might be perl magics it might not be

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:29,190
fully bash but you do the curly brackets

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:32,130
comma dot backup means that it it could

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,360
take some parameters before they come up

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,890
we know we don't give it anything so

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,310
we're just saying take the file name

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,500
that you have and create a new file with

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,680
that same file name plus dot backup dot

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,240
B KP for example so if you use that and

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,860
you get it in your fingers you have a

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,470
quicker way of copying a file if you

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,780
always want to do like dot bak or B KP

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,159
or whatever for backing up that file so

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:59,999
you know if you make changes and you

00:19:53,159 --> 00:20:02,789
revert you can just yeah vim I think I

00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:09,899
have to show some stuff here because if

00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:15,239
I just do if I'd used them like file one

00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:17,369
right this is a text editor okay how

00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:20,489
what do I do now like this is really not

00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:21,869
a parent like I'm just clicking random

00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,549
buttons now and suddenly something

00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,879
happened because I click the button I

00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:29,279
which means insert mode if I do escape I

00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:31,649
can do : and I can do commands here I

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,080
can do help so it's not the most

00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:37,320
intuitive editor but it's really

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,960
feature-rich the best way to get

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,779
familiar with it is just to go help name

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,139
tutor and then you get a file which

00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,669
leads to true like do this this way and

00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:49,169
try this out stuff and do it on this

00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,659
file and you you know you learn as you

00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:55,289
go along but I don't want to spend too

00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:57,229
much time on this but that may be one

00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:02,460
thing to just remember really good is

00:20:57,229 --> 00:21:04,859
that I don't manage so there you go is

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,799
that if you want to escape this let me

00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:10,169
just blow this up you literally just

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,009
have to remember queue and you might

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:15,019
have to remember and exclamation mark

00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:18,239
because if you don't

00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:21,869
uh-huh because sorry because if you

00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:24,629
don't then I'll tell you you did change

00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:29,729
oh yeah it will work if it was empty so

00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:34,129
it will work now whoo but if I did it

00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:36,359
change it won't work because there was a

00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:38,999
you'd changed something in the file

00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,220
since you last wrote to it so then the

00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:44,190
safest way is to always know that it's :

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,710
q enter and then you're safe because

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,450
then you can exit did you learn today I

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,599
have to exit them and use that been paid

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:57,809
with man pages I think that's more than

00:21:51,599 --> 00:22:00,059
enough as a takeaway and the Escape key

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:02,129
is your friend I've gone so far as I've

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,200
switched permanently my escape and

00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:06,900
capslock key because caps lock is quick

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,410
it's closer to my finger

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:14,490
it's pardon the French sucks when I use

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:16,800
someone else's computer but it works or

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,510
someone else uses my computer will

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,750
actually do some of this example in the

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,230
end I have to get up the IP address

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,060
because I have a server ready for us I

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,740
just want to mention that for some of

00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,030
you when you get into the backend or if

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,800
you do some coding you want to put your

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,930
code somewhere you might have to deal

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,060
with another server but the command line

00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,710
is just the server is mainly just you

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,470
interfacing with another computer and

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,840
you do it most often like 98% of the

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:46,260
time via the command line unless you're

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,260
on Windows for example and the stuff

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,490
that you do on the server is often a lot

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,860
of the stuff you would do on your normal

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,110
computer if you use the command line so

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,060
this is an example of going SSH meaning

00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,760
we're connecting a tunnel through a

00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,890
server secure connection where we can

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,680
then use the command line locally but

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:09,300
through the SSH tunnel on the other

00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:12,270
computer team Oakes is a great tool that

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,800
enables us to if we just do some stuff

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,890
in the server and then we close the

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,200
connection we go back again the last

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,650
session we had is gone t marks are a

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,500
great tool like new screen lets us open

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:27,780
a session that we can close and then we

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,820
close the sage connection we go back to

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,520
the server we can continue where we left

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,500
off you can also use T MUX locally

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,810
because it lets you split the screen in

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,830
terminal different session the sections

00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:42,150
and it can be a good workflow a tool but

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,460
it's nice to know that you can do that

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:46,080
and then vim again you could for example

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,080
have a workflow where you connect to a

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,170
server you do T MUX to set up a session

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,270
we do them to code some stuff you leave

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,460
it there you go away you can connect

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,840
back in two days and hopefully the

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,900
session is still there unless someone

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,020
screwed with a server or it went down or

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,760
whatever and control B D just lets you

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,000
when you're in T MUX detached from that

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,920
session then you do T MUX attached

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,710
unless you have already more sessions

00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,510
and then you can do T MUX LS which is

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,070
allows for lists and you can see if you

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,600
have more sessions and then you can

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,980
selectively choose which team are

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,390
session to go back into

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,370
this is more advanced but now you know

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:28,350
that that's stuff you can do I guess

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:31,730
process management and now we're on 14

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:35,850
of 17 sites it's not so much left

00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:37,650
awesome there's a great tool that is not

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,809
so often known about I think that's

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:43,200
called pit off so let me take a step

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,760
back in your Mac or your Linux

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
there's processes running I don't know

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,429
so much about the windows world there

00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,020
but there are processes but they're

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:51,179
managed different this far as I know so

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,790
here you would want to for example close

00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,710
down your Firefox that broke or Google

00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,630
Chrome or your video player like oh stop

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,330
froze what happened then you can go and

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,400
have a look at for the for you to

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,380
instruct the computer on what to do you

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,679
normally need the process ID app it is

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,880
just the process ID of something a

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,970
program like Google Chrome web for

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,490
example you can just repeat a program

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,200
instead of having to do PS Ochs and more

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,240
advanced tools to find and then grab

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,040
foreign stuff like if you just want to

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,480
do simple stuff paid off does a great

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,929
job it just finds you the pit of a

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,540
program then you get a pit like an ID a

00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:31,049
number then you can kill that number

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:34,169
that ID that paid that program and then

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:37,080
normally it just closes down and maybe

00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:38,730
your computer unfreezes this is

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,620
simplified because you would go more

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,870
into depth in this administration system

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,340
administration stuff like keep track of

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,000
stuff and have an idea what have been

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,340
sleeping and whole thing and like what

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,549
is hogging the most memory and the

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,929
processor is power whatever it's called

00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:58,320
top is a nice tool that's always there

00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,570
but if you do use Linux or I think it's

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,210
available with homebrew you can use h

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,570
top which is a even more simple

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,090
graphical user interface for managing

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,370
this a little bit more with like f3 and

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,809
f10 and searching and make cities

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,169
simpler for you but it's still in the

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,169
command line

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:22,950
maybe yes I'll show you this first after

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,020
or actually the last thing will demo

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:29,490
remember remind me to tell you about

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:32,010
nyan cat it's a great surprise to finish

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,810
the talk you don't have to just be

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,730
serious and all

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,730
yeah sis add me with the command line

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,960
there are great resources and I

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,300
mentioned these guys before hak5 hak5

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,070
they've been around forever they have

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,080
tons of great videos not just this

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,490
playlist but tons about if you want to

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,590
get more familiar with the command line

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,390
they're great at explaining stuff they

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,320
keep it simple maybe just a couple of

00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:01,200
commands per video it's really nice this

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,820
talk was made in vim so you saw before

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,860
the talk maybe we had some like last

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,730
minute like wow some stuff I up

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:18,540
some pardon my french I managed to mess

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:21,840
up with some stuff so this talk is

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,010
created in the command line the first

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,030
time I do this because I wanted

00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:29,100
something where I can just do that it's

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:34,080
an indirect index.html file that I'm

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:36,600
just modifying in them and it's we march

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,910
AS which is a library for doing slides

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:45,420
in your browser and you just create you

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:47,370
just write markup so you see it's an

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:51,360
HTML file with some stuff on top it

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:54,480
imports some fonts then at the bottom it

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,460
will then take the scripts needed for

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,520
the JavaScript so the slide show script

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,830
is this remark yes but in between here

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,280
all I'm writing is the content of the

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:07,740
stuff that you saw now the whole talk is

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,320
here starting with the top contents and

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,090
it's written in markdown my plan is to

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,180
get a little bit more experience with

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:20,130
this and maybe add my own style but I

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:22,470
really liked it this time around the

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,630
slides are available in our repo for F

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:30,330
receive free code camp Vienna and we

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:32,730
mark yes you can check out so I think

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,300
we'll start by just having a short

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,960
demonstration we've gone a bit longer

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:42,030
than I thought

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,660
so we'll keep it short but we'll go to

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,490
the server that I put up for us

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,080
we'll connect to the server and we can

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:53,160
play around with some commands and then

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,929
we'll try nyan cat in the end and after

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,220
the talk feel free to ask questions well

00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:57,539
I still have the stuff up we can show

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,870
something quickly if there's something

00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:04,530
related so now I'm just don't let that

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:06,630
confuse you but let me SSH

00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,760
like we had a command example into a

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:15,390
server is it big enough should I is that

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:18,409
good so now I'm connecting to a server

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:22,280
in a data center in front fault

00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:24,539
so this is not my computer anymore and

00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,520
here we saw the example of you for

00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:29,250
example using tea mugs so I can use the

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,159
clear command I can use right stuff

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,990
control L let's bash stuff I can write

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,770
stuff here and jump to the front jump to

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:40,049
the end I can write some silly commands

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,490
and then next time I drew controller but

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:44,010
this might not work this time around oh

00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,990
it does it shows us that the last time

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:55,260
we started with Dee we wrote the SF so I

00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:56,610
can do the same one again T MUX I won't

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,230
show you that here then because I

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,900
remember now I was in the process of

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,539
reinstalling it when my kid was hungry

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,740
so I didn't install it on the server it

00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,500
will take a while because we have to

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,440
update the whole process the whole cache

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:14,640
here but I'll show you Tmax afterwards

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,620
and we could use vim here to just I

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,480
think we'll take a step I can don't do

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,570
that because we will use it locally we

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,419
did do the server stuff we connect it to

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,580
the server I'll show you tea mugs yeah

00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,549
let's just go locally for the sake of

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,850
example let's pretend I'm on the server

00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:35,100
now I can do T MUX you see there's even

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,409
a command there's even like a graphical

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,120
thing down here with some information

00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:42,360
this might be some modifications here in

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,980
my convicts but now I can do control

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,870
like I can do some stuff here right I

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,190
can do like I can even open a vim

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:52,020
session and then I can do you see there

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,559
stuff here right this is a list of the

00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,390
files there now I can control BD I'm out

00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,280
again and I can do stuff you know I can

00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,770
even close this window and stuff

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,210
and then I go back if I don't do

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,650
anything else and go back it goes back

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:11,190
to the it doesn't go back to the same

00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:13,320
place so T marks so tells me there's a

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:20,670
window open and then I can now go T

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:22,290
marks attached t0 and now we're back to

00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,840
where we were so this stuff is still

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:30,320
running in the background normally if a

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,320
closed terminal is gone and UNIX world

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,870
we can see for example peed off and we

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,820
shouldn't do it on Google Chrome because

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:43,040
it has it's a bad example it has a lot

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:47,330
of crumbs here a lot of tabs and stuff I

00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:51,450
think it's maybe stable to Google

00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:52,950
doesn't work just a bit of tilde okay

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,220
this terminal that you see now is called

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,600
tilde I knew it was there it gives us a

00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,740
this one let me just check if there's

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,740
some stuff I don't want to close here

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:12,300
it's fine so if I now do kill this one

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:15,420
the travel is gone whoa it actually did

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,460
it did what we told it to do and because

00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:22,380
I killed it I have to take it up again

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,730
so okay that was one example just to

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,920
show you a different one that you can

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,960
this is still the command line this does

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,610
the job of telling us all the programs

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,940
that are running here I can even search

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,770
for Google gives us the one on top here

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,110
and I can kill Google Chrome now and

00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,820
this is easier because you see the the

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,080
shortcuts down there and this is easier

00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:47,400
to navigate around especially if you're

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:48,870
new to the command line I think we'll

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,050
just create a file and then we'll do the

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:54,420
nine cat and we'll finish so I am here

00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:58,680
now I'm listing out all the files here

00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:00,900
and listing it in a better format using

00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,900
flags so we can see the size the new

00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:11,670
human readable way and so forth then I

00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,470
want to go and make a directory I do my

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,450
dear

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,610
no but it tells me you can equate it

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,590
because my dear doesn't exist so we use

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:21,950
the flag we talked about earlier now

00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:26,480
there exists my dear hello it's just too

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,520
small maybe now we're here now I can

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,280
touch a file so there's nothing here now

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:37,720
I can touch a file now there is a file

00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:42,500
living here I can touch file two and

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:45,950
three and four now there are more files

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:51,919
here I can list them like this and then

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:57,260
I can do echo this is awesome

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:59,480
and I can put that into file one there's

00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,850
another command let's just print out

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,460
everything in the file to the screen so

00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:09,200
we see this has now this is awesome then

00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:11,359
I want to have another file another line

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,639
in that file and it shows us this file

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,060
contains these two things and we can

00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,679
figure that out again with vim so it

00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:25,159
shows us now we can edit this stuff and

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:27,379
I can add a third line awesome it's

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,790
there so I'm using the command I'm just

00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:30,649
using the stuff to show earlier it might

00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,869
seem like magic when I'm doing it and

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:36,080
I'm even using ctrl a to go back here

00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:36,530
tell-tell using them and I'm doing that

00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,419
right

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,010
it's not that complicated just needs to

00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:42,889
practice practice practice and it's in

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:45,440
your fingers I think we're good to end

00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:47,480
now on a good note if you don't have

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,980
nyan cat won't always be there you have

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,780
to install it you have to install this

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,960
program um sure it's on homebrew on Mac

00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,240
it's on Linux and you get a nice nyan

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,670
cat in your command line it has colors

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,560
and stuff it's awesome this is something

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,020
you can do especially if you do like a

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,490
full screen like this you open up a

00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,619
terminal you put it fullscreen

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,089
you put a nine cat on your colleagues or

00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,650
a friend's computer don't tell me I did

00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,260
it and I'm not endorsing this in any way

00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:15,560
this is not plural blah and you can just

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:19,369
leave the screen there like what you can

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:22,599
also go to nyan cat calm known I am NOT

00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:26,300
cat and gives you an ice cream

00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:30,380
so I think that's it

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,670
thanks for your well thanks for your

00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:36,579
attention and yeah

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,579
