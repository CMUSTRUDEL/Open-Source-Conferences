	Talk by Annette Aubell and Tijana Maksimovic
In our shared pursuit to push the web to do more, we're running into a common problem: PERFORMANCE. How do we actually know where we stand in terms of performance, and what are common performance bottlenecks? Is it expensive JavaScript, heavy images, slow web font delivery or sluggish rendering? Is it worth exploring priority-hints, code-splitting and resource hints? And, most importantly, where do we even start improving performance and what web resources can help us on this journey? After visiting the recently held performance workshop of Harry Roberts in Linz, this presentation should help giving answers to those emerging questions concerning best Webperformance practices of 2019.
