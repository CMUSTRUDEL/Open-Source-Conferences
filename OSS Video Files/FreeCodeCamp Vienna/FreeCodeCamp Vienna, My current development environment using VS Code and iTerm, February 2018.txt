	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
I will be talking about my current

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,420
environment for web development I will

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,940
be talking about what text editor I'm

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,330
using and what terminal and what shall

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,990
I'm using because I experienced in many

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,730
in many talks after the meetups that

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,439
people are constantly discussing what

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,619
they are using and what would be good

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,580
and advantages and disadvantages of all

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,920
the text editors so I just quickly going

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,710
to show you my setup and afterwards we

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,399
can have a collective discussion but

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,239
what you are using and what's best so

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm using Visual Studio code and I term

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,620
you can see here is Visual Studio code

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,489
and here is I term how many of you are

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:52,050
using Visual Studio code okay that's a

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,289
lot yeah so I I tried many many text

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,350
editors I tried at home Visual Studio

00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:01,980
webstorm brackets and ultimately I ended

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,260
up with wishes to decode yes it was

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,060
really amazed when I was using Visual

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,030
Studio that there is a thing like

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,520
intelligence and for c-sharp development

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,850
you have to use basically Visual Studio

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,280
and so I tried with Studio code and I'm

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,290
happy ever since and I'm also going to

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,390
talk about I term the terminal I use

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:27,240
because the basic terminal is - I think

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:31,049
or it's called terminal something like

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,360
this however I will not spend much time

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,090
here because I'm not using it that that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,040
often and also visual studio code comes

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,320
with a terminal on its own yes I think

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,939
that's it another important information

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,030
is that I'm using a Mac MacBook Pro and

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:53,850
yeah so the first thing I want to talk

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,540
about is wishes to decode and the

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,840
features are displayed here if you click

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,759
on the link here you should go to the

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:11,500
home page which is not this plate

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:19,510
doesn't matter we'll just copy it

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:28,720
or we'll even even yeah we even just

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:33,040
open it here and show you they should

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:44,640
work right now yeah so so as I'm working

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:47,860
on here I'm going for Visual Studio and

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,800
here are the main features displayed

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,800
first of all the has it has intelligence

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,500
which is practically just syntax

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,040
highlighting and also autocomplete I was

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,810
very amazed when called encountered this

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,130
feature it basically allows you to

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,310
suggest you the methods of objects or

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,440
functions whatever and I will afterward

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,170
show a short showcase on how to use it

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,970
and then it will be clearer and much

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,810
easier to understand

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,640
there's also debugging involved in

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,519
Visual Studio code you don't need to

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,140
debug in Chrome or whatever browser you

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,780
are using

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:33,180
you have also built in good comments and

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,250
it's ultimately easy to extend extend

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:41,560
but I think nowadays most of the editors

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:47,739
are easy to extend I also created or

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,630
even wrote an article about about the

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,970
Visual Studio code extensions I'm using

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:58,600
and this is actually the article it has

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,090
which pretty much good success I've just

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,820
listed all my extensions I'm using I'm

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,530
using extensions for HTML like auto

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:11,170
close tag rename tag HTML snippets

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,959
markdown extensions of course JavaScript

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,959
extensions this is very important

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,900
debugger for Chrome you can easily start

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,240
debugging without a lot of configuration

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,460
maybe I can show you that as well of

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,500
course he is lint linting checking your

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,520
code

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,710
yes in modules intelligence so if you if

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,710
you're interested just go to the article

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:39,819
and check out the extensions they are

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:44,169
pretty nice for developing yes that's

00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:47,250
the article about extensions and the

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:52,449
next thing I want to show you is I term

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:55,870
is anyone using I term okay one awesome

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:58,680
then just a short and quick introduction

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,180
to our term just give you an overview

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,280
just typing in I term and it should be

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,039
the first one it's a terminal especially

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,530
for Mac OS and if I go to features you

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,410
can see what what you can do with with I

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:14,889
term you can split panes you have hot

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,520
key windows you can search for stuff you

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:21,490
can autocomplete yeah so different

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:26,319
features that makes the use of of a

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:29,470
terminal very easy and efficient I never

00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:33,130
really used use the integrated terminal

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,560
of Mac OS started using item right away

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,500
because I was recommended to use it and

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,680
I was always happy yes

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,490
so that's the I turn part and if I go

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,990
through the presentation I'm also using

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,310
it with I think I will just put it in

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,219
here because that's too complicated

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,349
otherwise I also combined it with good

00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:01,810
set shell is anyone else using to test

00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:03,969
shell one nice I use it with the oh my

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,150
oh my Z or however it's called

00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:11,169
it has some nice our teams and features

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,539
and also using the out of suggestions

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,120
which I'll show you in in practice as

00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,909
well there's also a good article and it

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,120
will show the slides afterwards so you

00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:26,590
can check that out as well since my

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:30,360
setup here is a little bit weird I will

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:36,400
go right away to the demonstration part

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:38,950
created a nice a nice slide here yes so

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,950
now I'm going to demonstrate how

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:47,290
using both visual studio code and the I

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:50,430
term just figuring out how to use it

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:55,660
properly here I think the best thing is

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:59,410
to just put it in there and looking on

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,810
top so maybe another nice feature is to

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,600
use spectacle is someone using that for

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:11,560
Mac OS it's just that you can switch

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:15,010
with your window probably here it comes

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,990
on default by yeah but Mac doesn't have

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,460
has have something like this

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,440
so spectacle on top the glasses is a

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,900
nice tool and that's for free and it's

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,450
working great so as you can see here I

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,600
can't really stand on the side you know

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:37,750
as you can see here is that's the

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,540
terminal I have use used a nice team

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,790
with coloring and showing the get status

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,220
and I'm currently at the developers

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,880
rising repository because I want to

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,100
demonstrate how to add stuff to the

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,110
homepage so what I can do next at first

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,110
or what I want to show you first with

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,530
all message and and the tech shell in

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:03,070
general is to show you the LRS allows ya

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,890
that comes out of the box and they are a

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,780
lot especially a lot with kid that's

00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:11,080
very useful this can be very useful you

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,640
can see here and for example if I want

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,080
to do something I can get status which

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,770
is just just and it shows me my current

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,840
status of get so what's also very nice

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,380
and works well with which is to decode

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:30,370
it's not when I'm typing or maybe let's

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:33,360
have it like this if I'm tithing yeah

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,360
probably

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,520
so so if I'm typing code dot there is

00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,390
I've installed it in the path

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:47,120
I can't just open visual studio code and

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:51,680
now it opens of course in my other

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,960
window but here it is and here are

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,480
having the terminal on my site so I can

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,000
always work with the terminal here on

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,150
this side and can work with the editor

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,280
on this side so what I wanted to

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,060
demonstrate now is just to see how

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:12,620
Visual Studio code works you have

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:17,150
options here to show you the folders and

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:20,990
files you have a search you have an own

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:23,780
section for your get stuff you have a

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,200
debugger mode and the extensions listed

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,480
and it's also very easy to install

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,340
install extensions you can just add them

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,040
here and here

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:38,180
activate them install them uninstall

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:43,010
them etc what's interesting is also

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:47,120
maybe was a little bit bigger here no

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:50,090
she better know you also have a console

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,390
here you have a debug console you have a

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,590
terminal depending on what shell you

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,770
have installed you can also use the

00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:00,620
comments here you see just work working

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,020
fine and it's also if you have a linter

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,970
or something else installed it displays

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,180
all the problems and stuff that is not

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,120
working so what I did here is as you

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,150
know we have a home page for we are for

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,950
developers rising and I just added our

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,960
new partner that is we accelerate for

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,820
chests and search everything is working

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:29,660
easily we accelerate you can see it just

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,270
put in their dev here a div class this

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,130
section here and now it one of the

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,010
benefits with Visual Studio code is if

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,040
you can you can simply click on the tab

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,230
here just show me the working tree here

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,270
and show me the difference and its side

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,960
by side showing you what you have added

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,200
or changed and it's working perfectly on

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,620
this

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,350
on the side here you even have a mark

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,600
where the change in your file is so if

00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,529
you're if you are having a large file

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,079
with thousand lines then this really

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:07,010
helps and in this case I quickly can see

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:10,480
okay I have here added a div so now what

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm going to do is I use the terminal I

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,810
most of the time I'm using the

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,149
determinant terminal to use kid stuff

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,550
because it's just faster so once again I

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:23,360
use the check git status to check what

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,839
I've what I've done now say okay I'm

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,329
using also a Liars here and said okay I

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:36,019
using a cookie to commit with a message

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:41,060
and I say just add new partner partner

00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:43,100
we accept the rate accelerate is this

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,000
correctly yeah

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,980
oh maybe with a double D you can also

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,980
use it like oh holy what's that

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,870
so now that it says are still something

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:04,310
missing okay I have logo so just get at

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:06,199
all very easy just and then I can ah

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,250
what I also want to show you is the

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:13,100
complete I just go in with that and it

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,769
shows me the last the last commit I did

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,600
with with a type of message like did

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:25,779
this so I use I just say add yeah a new

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:34,370
partners logo awesome

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:36,319
I don't want to do that remove so this

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,459
is not working what I'm doing now is

00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:44,540
just pressing ctrl C to get out of this

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:47,420
whatever it was have no idea

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,370
so I'm trying it again still just out

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:58,110
completing it what

00:12:50,370 --> 00:13:00,900
now it's working right no true true true

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,700
true awesome now it's working and now

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,120
instead of get push I set the upstream

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,130
already so just GP and now it pushes to

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,540
the master branch and that's pretty easy

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:16,410
we'll also want to show you is now this

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,510
one resolvers so it's it it's connected

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,230
and knows that there is there there are

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,900
no changes and what I want to do or show

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,990
you as well is to go to the Help section

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,610
and if you haven't worked with Visual

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,650
Studio code you can easily just download

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,089
it install it and then you can go to the

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,150
interactive playground that is what I

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:41,070
wanted to show you and here we actually

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,860
I think this is amazing and I haven't

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,050
seen this anywhere else it has an

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,870
interactive playground where you can try

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,610
to use the features so here is a

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:55,410
interactive playground you can see the

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,510
numbers here you can simply do some as

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,600
it is explained here you can combine

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:05,850
different keys and for example add

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,890
multiple cursors on 10y different stuff

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,780
awesome

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:17,010
but you can also maybe if I want to just

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:19,950
switch lines or cut multiple multiply

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,540
lines can also do that very easily I can

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,800
switch them around that's very easy I

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,250
also can do is I'm not quite sure if

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,230
I've installed this here just on the

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,320
line going down and adding I don't know

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,670
what is this here no idea maybe you can

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,589
add another comment hi

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:45,300
that's it awesome and I can also delete

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:48,089
it cool so that's a great feature and it

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,529
just goes through the stuff here what I

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,279
want to show you is actually the

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,430
intellisense

00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:57,510
which is amazing here is a basic Express

00:14:53,430 --> 00:15:01,380
example and what intellisense allows you

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,460
to do is if you type app now and then

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:08,700
dot

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:13,140
then it should suggest you things which

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:15,900
it doesn't I'm not

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,970
it does but this is not optimized

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,240
because that's the playground doesn't

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:27,270
matter it does what it should do it just

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:29,390
suggests you features and methods that's

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:41,730
not working really in the playground

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:45,050
maybe I'm using it yeah yeah I don't

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,480
think it's working like it should here

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:51,920
doesn't matter you can try it on your

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,540
own and it hopefully will work

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,330
the airline action of talking about that

00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,300
refactoring so there is plenty of other

00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:03,180
stuff on how to speed up your coding and

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,680
I think it's pretty good especially if

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,690
you're starting with the free card game

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,420
curriculum you have the box where you

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,820
write your code inside and at the

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,460
beginning it is okay but when you later

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,260
have to write longer code I think it's

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,170
more and more important to have a good

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,900
editor with syntax highlighting and also

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,450
suggestions and what I've used in the

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,340
curriculum when I was more advanced and

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:30,060
working from the advanced algorithms I

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,840
was always writing the stuff inside the

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:37,170
text editor like Adam or wishes to

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,490
decode and I think it's just easier to

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,430
work with it

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:44,310
test it and see if you're working the

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:48,300
algorithm the right way instead of using

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:51,450
the field on the homepage yeah I think

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,070
that's it I think those are the most

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,320
important things I just wanted to go

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,640
through since the setup is really weird

00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,250
here for me I'm not going to demonstrate

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:05,700
more yes oh yeah I haven't introduction

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,800
or maybe I can close somewhere is the

00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,100
presentation yes here's the background

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:15,320
credit for somewhere Taylor from

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,410
unsplash yeah just about me a little bit

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,300
core

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,290
organizing this meet up with Rob with

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:24,290
Robert and I'm a business law student

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,120
I'm working as a front-end developer

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:30,150
currently I'm focusing on machine

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,040
learning and also did if anyone is

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:38,850
interested in machine learning I also

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:41,370
did where is that or I even have even

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,880
wrote an article actually so find it it

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:47,910
would be nice yeah it's here

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,050
so if you if you are whoa if you're

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,550
trying to get into machine learning

00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,040
there's a great course online

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,020
it's from Kucera because arawa is also

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,450
an online learning platform it has very

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,450
it has a lot of different courses I

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,290
think also in CSS and JavaScript and

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,690
stuff like that but I did the machine

00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,820
learning course and I also wrote tips

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,190
and tricks on how to do it I think it

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,320
takes three months or something and it's

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,290
just amazing so I can also recommend to

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,960
check especially this course because the

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,470
teacher is amazing also the platform

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,640
Coursera

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,440
it's amazing yes this was my setup now

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,380
we can discuss your setups or if you

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,330
have any questions just feel free to ask

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,180
thank you very much

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,180
