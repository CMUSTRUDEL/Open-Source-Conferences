Description: 
	Low-Code Web Development & Oracle APEX - talk by Stefan Dobre

In this talk, Stefan will dive into the world of low-code and database driven web-development and demonstrate how you can quickly build secure, scalable and production-ready web apps in just minutes, while writing as little code as possible.

The technology demoed will be Oracle Application Express (APEX for short), running on a free version of the Oracle Database.

alright hello everyone and welcome to

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,319
the load Co low code web development

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,860
talk and as an example we'll have Oracle

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,160
apex again do you guys have any low code

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,179
experience or do you know what that is

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,199
good

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,660
second question sequel do you guys know

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,580
some sequel or in some dialect of it

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,750
do you guys know PL sequel by any chance

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,369
or the procedural language version of

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,189
sequel for example you can find it in

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,899
the Oracle database or in Postgres

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,730
as well some okay that's good it's not

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,700
that difficult is just an extension of

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:47,129
sequel really we will need it for the

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:51,390
Oracle apex talk so to myself I am

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:54,239
Stephan I study computer science and I

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,370
do web development stuff using low code

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,170
that's how you can contact me in case

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:05,729
you feel like it just a definition what

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:09,479
is this whole thing it's basically as an

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,270
analogy we could say we have to write

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,659
code to make applications so somehow we

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,939
do get invested in code but really it's

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,680
just a means to an end so ideally we

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,189
should not have to write any code as

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,740
much as we enjoy it right so we would do

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,270
one those applications but without code

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,549
right do we agree on that

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,310
because code can bring bugs it's

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,350
difficult to maintain it's a mess people

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,750
do it in different ways but we still

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,810
want the applications that's sort of the

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,460
idea let's get web applications or any

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,659
sort of applications with the writing as

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,970
little code as possible so again we

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,040
should think what instead of how what do

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,079
we want not how really do we want to

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,340
make it we just want the end product

00:01:52,079 --> 00:02:00,200
really just some aspects of it in

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,610
general how it's usually done it is

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,960
usually implemented using some graphical

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,969
user interface some sort of

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,190
drag-and-drop system you would see in

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,989
all of the different platforms some sort

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,710
of arrows from here to here then this

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,910
happens then this diverges or there's

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,780
variation of that in all of those

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,270
platforms of course that replaces some

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,680
code but not all there's always some

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,380
code that you have to write that's why

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
it's low code it's not no code which is

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,520
something else but that's not really fun

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,620
for us at all in my opinion so low code

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,410
I think is the sweet spot between no

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,370
code and what we're used to lots of code

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,320
usually it is an answer to a specific

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,030
problem so you will see a platform that

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,580
focuses on something like business

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,230
applications or mobile applications

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,840
unfortunately there's not one platform

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,120
that does it all some try but in my

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,010
opinion they fail they don't do it so

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,890
well so we have to work with what we

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,470
have so there will be cons to using low

00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,260
code platforms they all provide a set of

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,910
tools which is really cool like you

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,320
don't have to go find all the libraries

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,180
in the world and combine them and make

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,520
sure they work together and you know

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,800
inherit all the bugs that they have all

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,570
of these platforms tend to provide as

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,770
much as possible for the users in terms

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,530
of authentication methods logging

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,720
debugging stuff components already built

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,000
in so that you don't have to download

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,450
them from some weird website that

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,340
doesn't support them afterwards and

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,770
again it is not a new concept in I think

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,750
the 70s and 80s it used to be called

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,500
fourth-generation programming languages

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,480
that's how people refer to them as then

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,520
in the 90s there used to be the concept

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,270
of rapid application development you

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,520
would still see that around then we went

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,190
through declarative programming but now

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,200
we've settled sort of on low code I

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,970
think that from what I'm seeing in the

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,410
industry that's the way to go because

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,470
there's no code low code and

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:02,060
higher-level languages but it is not a

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:05,840
new concept in terms of pros what are

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,790
some pros of using such a platform there

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,240
is less code to maintain that is I think

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,100
the biggest one less bugs less stuff to

00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,960
change when a new version comes out what

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,090
if something becomes the support it

00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,710
something becomes deprecated if you

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,660
there's no code there's nothing to worry

00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:25,550
about the person or the the platform the

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,380
local platform itself makes sure that

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,690
your apps will

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:33,700
running as they evolve so we push that

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,820
unto them they are easier to learn and

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,870
then a full-fledged Java framework I

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,910
would say because they are more visual

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,530
more people can contribute in terms of

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,810
and I've seen this as real-world

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:51,670
examples even the end users if the

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,680
governance over that application decides

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,080
to can actually make changes to the

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,180
application so it would not be difficult

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,950
for let's say a manager to go into the

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,860
application and say actually this page

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:06,040
should not be seen by these users that's

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,020
a case scenario or this person should

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,600
not make this choice or let's turn this

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,190
feature off these are really easy

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,660
clickable things so they don't always

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,420
have to go to the developer hey can you

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,340
please do this or some some another end

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,080
user could say I have this huge report

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,570
but I don't want to see all the columns

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,150
in it I only need these ones the end

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,130
user can just click a few buttons these

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,010
are the columns that I want to see and

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,780
it doesn't break the whole application

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,700
that's in my opinion pretty pretty great

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,350
many components out of the box I've

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,850
mentioned that extremely fast

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:42,190
development in my in my opinion cons you

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,140
are stuck to a vendor if the vendor dies

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,700
your application dies unfortunately

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,630
that's why I don't really trust all

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,850
those application low code frameworks

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,410
that you know come came out last year I

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,300
would not jump onto them right away I

00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,470
would want to pick a mature one that I'm

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,350
sure will be supported in the future

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:06,490
which is why I'm gonna present Oracle

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:09,700
apex less flexibility so you will not be

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,640
able to do 100% of what you want to do

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,520
you'll be able to do 95% if you can live

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,500
with that that's good if you want

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,700
extreme control over everything low code

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,350
probably isn't the right choice they are

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,210
not the newest technologies usually

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,430
because they have to be mature to

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,560
support all of their end users so you

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,720
will see stuff like jQuery being used a

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,240
lot maybe we're not excited about jQuery

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,070
anymore but for example in Oracle apex

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,150
it is there because it is the most

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:44,139
mature most documented and it's worth

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,479
great for for most users yes and it is

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,820
not exactly cool among developers we

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,720
like to say you know especially in the

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,570
jQuery

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,910
Jib JavaScript era we want angular we

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,560
want react we want all of this stuff

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,270
because it's hip and cool but maybe

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:06,190
that's not actually the most productive

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:09,880
for some categories of applications some

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,610
examples of technologies would be and

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,120
they're kind of not easy to find they're

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,010
not not much research has been done in

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,690
this area really so you're gonna see a

00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,240
lot of conflicting opinions on the

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,710
internet what's the best one or stuff

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,150
like that

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,760
this is just some graph that I found I

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,910
guess the higher the better

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,340
I don't know but just some companies

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,539
this would be Oracle apex out systems I

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,750
know for sure this one is a really

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,760
powerful one matrix I don't know what

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,650
that was called a peon I've also heard

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,150
of that one it is difficult to really

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,160
look into all of them because you need

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,889
to invest a lot of time to know what the

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,570
thing does completely but yes Oracle

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:54,250
apex and out systems I can vouch that

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:58,300
they are pretty solid choices this would

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,160
be out systems yeah so so you kind of

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,690
see the interface of how a thing would

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,830
work for example right now it's building

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:08,560
a phone application I guess Android but

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:16,000
out system can also do I believe desktop

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:20,880
apps and web apps APN is also some sort

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,949
of enterprise ready development tool and

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,250
again mendax that that's what that one

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,550
was so you see kind of how the

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,440
development would work in those

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,150
platforms again all of these three that

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,169
I just mentioned they are extremely

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:41,380
expensive so for enthusiasts or students

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,560
whatever not affordable a huge

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,710
corporation a big company no problem but

00:08:44,560 --> 00:09:02,649
most of us not a chance

00:08:47,710 --> 00:09:06,640
a peon that's another technology I will

00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:09,850
skip this slide actually just due to the

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,000
sake of time let's get to the one that I

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,760
know and I can tell you something about

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,029
which is Oracle apex so in this low code

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,700
you make web applications with it and it

00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:25,060
is database centric meaning the logic

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,970
part happens in the database your logic

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,770
your business logic is in the database

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,450
if you can get over that because at

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,180
university or study teacher the three

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,910
layer model which makes sense you know

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,910
you have your presentation your business

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,890
and your persistence layers they say

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,010
these two have to be separate the

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,290
business and the persistence in the

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,850
Oracle world they're one thing because

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,040
they have the PL sequel programming

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,930
language which can do everything that a

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,839
middle tier language can do all the

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,959
logic happens in the database which is

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,850
why it's database centric these are just

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,089
some things that Oracle says about their

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,910
technology all inclusive app dev

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:12,190
environment blah blah blah a most

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,440
popular local platform for enterprise

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,750
apps I do believe that is true for

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,570
mobile apps I still think something like

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,709
out systems still beats them because

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:27,670
they are out system does make native

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:29,320
phone apps and yes if you want to make

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,140
something more dynamic so not just a

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,300
static application you are going to need

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,760
some sequel and PL sequel but it's

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,709
really in my opinion not difficult at

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,329
all if you've known any if you know any

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:42,040
JavaScript I think Java Script is a

00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:47,020
thousand times more difficult and weird

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,610
and then PL sequel so what is the stack

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,350
what do you need to create such an

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:56,140
application the browser that's free and

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,790
then this is the server part let's say

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,120
you have a server but you will need

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,790
Oracle database on it

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,890
they only run on certain servers but

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:11,520
cent OS would be a free server that

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:15,570
database can run on the database itself

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:18,150
everyone thinks Oracle expensive for a

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,290
reason but they also have a free version

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:24,210
called Oracle XE which can do 99% of

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,460
what the full-fledged really expensive

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,920
one can do of course it's not open

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,810
source but it is extremely powerful in

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,140
my opinion more powerful than my sequel

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,840
and so on but that's up to debate ok so

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,390
we have the browser it communicates with

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,030
this little extension to the tomcat web

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:46,110
server which is called orts which

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:48,240
translates requests unto a connection to

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,470
the database the database processes that

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,850
request throws it back and then that's

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,860
all the communication occurs in your

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,820
application all the logic and

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:04,080
persistence goes here and yeah that's a

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,700
free stack so no cost whatsoever or it

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,500
can also be used for rest services

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,650
that's all it stands for all oracle rest

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,150
data services between database and you

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,460
can have a rest endpoint basically

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,230
that's what else does in also in a

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,310
declarative manner so you don't have to

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,000
write any code to do that which is

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:23,270
pretty cool so that's the stack just

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,890
some little points before we start the

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:33,060
demo again if you you don't have to

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:36,000
write any HTML CSS or JavaScript in the

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,510
front end but you definitely can and you

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,220
probably will have to because it's you

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,370
know sometimes it's necessary and it's

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,530
also pretty fun to do so out of the box

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:50,820
you have a lot of components but it's

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:53,720
nice to customize them yourself again PL

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,890
sequel in the back end there is a new

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,380
there testing something out to have

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,210
JavaScript running in the back end into

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,630
the day in the database and I've tested

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:06,900
it out it seems to work but I do believe

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,670
PL sequel was made with a purpose and it

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,920
makes sense to use what's been there for

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,150
you know so many years that has all the

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,830
libraries included in it

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,770
anything you could wish for

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,570
can do the IDE so what is this whole

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,010
thing where do we work with it it is

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,600
web-based so you are going to be

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:26,850
building your applications in a web

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:32,100
browser it's been around since 2004 so

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:35,010
it is fully tested fully robust lots of

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,330
companies all around the world use it it

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,160
is not that popular because again

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,830
corporations use it it's not like a cool

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,980
you know student software open-source

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:46,560
nothing of that sort that's why you

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,040
don't see it as much but it is behind

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,180
some really important businesses right

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,940
and in terms of what you get

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,120
out-of-the-box JavaScript and PL sequel

00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,210
API is anything that you might need in a

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,460
primarily business application but also

00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,810
any other sort of web app everything is

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,470
there that you need so you don't have to

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,240
go around

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,310
fetching libraries and putting stuff

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,350
together you can but you don't have to

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,480
stuff like authentication logging

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,170
debugging that's all in there

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,960
in cool little component apps in terms

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,890
of components I'll show you some charts

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,710
everything is included you don't need

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:27,680
extra libraries the theme is pretty it's

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:32,460
called the universal theme it's pretty

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:36,000
fimA Beltaine jabo I'll get to that a

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:40,020
bit later so that's what the environment

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,370
will look like and that's where you will

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,030
also write your code if you have to

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,580
write any code however once your app

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,670
gets too big or it becomes less static

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,440
you can and should probably move to a

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,270
more traditional way of development for

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,430
example on the JavaScript side to use a

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,670
text editor something like vs code and

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:02,690
on the logic slash database side to use

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:08,100
sequel developer or any other sort of

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:10,080
database coding tool afterwards you

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,730
export those files whatever source code

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,220
you wrote and you import them in the

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,740
application and that's how the to

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,740
connect okay

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,050
so I'll just make an application

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,709
basically is what I'm about to do

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:35,850
hopefully an interesting one hopefully

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:38,700
nothing goes wrong first off that's how

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,860
the interface looks so I'm running this

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,480
on my localhost in a docker image so in

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,899
my daugher I have my database I have

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,500
words that's it that's all I need just a

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,680
web browser

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,070
you know nothing more than that let's

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,070
sign-in

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:08,370
okay let's go to the app builder because

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:09,390
we want to build an app by the way the

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,760
app builder itself

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,940
this is also an apex app so everything

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,370
you see here was made in Apex so it's a

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,710
bit meta but same with vs code or

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,650
something it is a you know a JavaScript

00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:26,070
based web app that you can make web apps

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,840
in it's sort of the same thing so let's

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,010
create a new app these are some of my

00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,530
apps let's create a new app what type of

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:39,180
app is it I don't know a new application

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:43,100
let's say I'm not sure why this is

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,100
what's happening in my daugher right now

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,180
let's give this application a name let's

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:57,230
call it let's make some application that

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:02,510
we can add meetups for a free code camp

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:06,900
event let's call it free code camp

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,700
events we'll leave everything standard

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,930
we don't need fans in the beginning

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,930
great application

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:30,850
as always it isn't usually this slow I

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:32,590
have no idea what's going on the

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,140
database is already created we just

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:39,940
create the metadata for the application

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,710
in the database okay so now we're inside

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,550
of the application we have three pages

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,380
so it is a paste bay page based

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,900
application let's run it let's see what

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,840
a empty application looks like by

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,330
default there will be an authentication

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,090
we can turn that off we don't have to

00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:02,440
let's sign in that's what we have it is

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:04,390
empty and pretty sad has a little menu

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,800
on the side this is the default theme

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,080
not all applications are going to look

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,290
like this but this is just by default

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,730
what it comes out with that's the theme

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,170
it is responsive so on the phone it

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,480
looks pretty great you can make these

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,400
menus be on top on the bottom a bunch of

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,600
crazy things but let's keep it simple in

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:27,010
the beginning but to save our events we

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:30,760
want to make some events we need some

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:33,670
data model some table in our database if

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,120
you're not familiar with Oracle you

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:41,110
don't know the Oracle dialect of sequel

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,000
Oracle made this little tool that you

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,730
can write whatever table name is here

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,740
and then the columns that you have you

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:52,780
know this is wrong and then it will

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,200
output on the right side the actual

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,880
script to build your to build your data

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,840
model so for now we just have a table

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,240
with some columns in it and the primary

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,300
key let's just copy this in case I will

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,620
get logged out and generate that sequel

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,740
again already prepared it I don't know

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,970
let's say our event has a location a

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:18,550
date when that event will take place

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:21,160
some type and some more information the

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,730
interesting thing about the whole app

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,160
builder interface here is that you also

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,050
have a sequel workshop a place where you

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,280
can actually access your database right

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,600
in your browser you don't need any other

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,150
software so let's go to sequel commands

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,160
or we can execute actual commands to our

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,150
database in our browser let's paste that

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,150
script to create a table let's run it

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,180
table created okay so our table is

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:54,180
called FCC event let's go back to the

00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:54,510
Builder yes the database was already

00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,130
there

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,380
we made an app and now we created a

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:02,970
table yeah

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:10,200
yes totally empty yes yes what did we

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:11,820
call our app free code camp Thanks so

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,410
what do we do with that table let's say

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,930
we want to visualize what's in that

00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:19,650
table so we enter our page and this is

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:24,320
the most important screen of Apex really

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,320
on the left side you are going to have

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,900
something is really going on in my

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,900
daugher right now I have no idea what

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,050
on the left side you will have a

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,960
hierarchical view of the elements on

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:45,540
your page so let's start with something

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,990
simple let's create a new region that we

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:53,100
call test region and let's put some text

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:55,230
in it we save it we save our builder we

00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:00,150
save our application we go back to the

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:01,830
app we refresh it and now we have a test

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,960
region with that content in it

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,830
that's as basic as you can go for a

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:11,340
region but that's pretty boring and just

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,560
in a basic region so let's add something

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,840
like we can see the contents of a table

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,300
ideally like a report so we could go to

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,790
an interactive report so these are all

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,260
the region types that we have

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,300
interactive report and which table do we

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:29,330
want to see we just select again with

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,330
already writing any sequel we can select

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,690
these are all the tables that I guess I

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,690
have in my database let's search for FCC

00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:00,450
we select that table we save again our

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:03,130
work in progress we refresh the page and

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,780
we have this little widget here but it's

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,500
kind of empty because there's no data in

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,150
that table yet so also actually let's

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,380
get rid of that test region up top

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,060
because it's kind of boring in

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,800
traditional programming you would kind

00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,900
of comment out some code to make

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,800
something disappear or delete some file

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,510
I have no idea but here it's pretty

00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,250
simply just a block of something so we

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,800
could go to a server side condition for

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,790
this region set it to never and now you

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,080
see it's kind of strikethrough

00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,280
so now that region which does not appear

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,640
there we can turn it back on if we want

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,740
later but it's easy to turn off features

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,030
on and off also blocks of code it's

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,270
really easy to turn off or add a

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,590
condition to it so you know we have so

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,830
many conditions to choose from when

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,940
something shows when something happens

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,440
but so it's kind of boring we don't have

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,930
any data so let's go ahead and create

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,830
another page in our application we go on

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:58,870
this + and we create a page we want to

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,360
create a page with a form with some

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:06,400
fields in it which end up in that table

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:11,890
so let's click on Form we want that form

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:16,110
to be on a table a page name let's call

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,110
it add event

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:32,400
let me just write this yes create a

00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:35,760
navigation entry for this page again we

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,220
have to tell select which table that

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,220
data from that form should end up in

00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,960
in the FCC event table we see all our

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,320
columns in there again without any

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,050
sequel of course you can use a crazier

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,700
sequel if you want but it's much simpler

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,880
to just use those wizards that they

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,800
already have here for us okay so by

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,800
default this page will be created

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:19,690
it really takes half a second I don't

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,460
know let's refresh our app so we have

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,120
that empty page and then another page

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,860
here at event and that already has text

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,230
fields and text areas and a bunch of

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,120
stuff that were automatically

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,740
interpreted from our table so it knew

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,540
that one of the columns was a date so

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,600
what did it do it put a date picker on

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,309
it so everything automatic but this

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,130
location this doesn't have to be a text

00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:44,200
area I can just be a text field right so

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:48,940
let's go to page two and see what our

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,280
hierarchy looks like we have this region

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,190
and then we have all our items but

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,110
location organized your first name

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,150
organizer last name organizer email

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,059
these can all be text fields so they're

00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:04,720
a bit smaller on the screen right in

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:07,030
terms of the type the type of meetup

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,700
that we want to have we can make this a

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:13,390
select list again without having to

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:16,570
change the HTML around what list of

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,910
values should this select list have some

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,720
static ones let's say our meetup can be

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:30,910
for information or our meetup can be for

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:33,990
fun or a talk let's see all the changes

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,990
that we made how they

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:48,070
okay so these fields became small and

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,840
the type that is a select list now it's

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,730
a bit it takes too much of the screen to

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,960
be honest so we can just click the whole

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:58,090
region it's it's a twelve column system

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,650
so instead of automatic we can just say

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,180
hey take six columns of the screen

00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,660
because maybe later we want to have

00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:10,510
another something next next with

00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:11,620
something else next to this region so

00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,510
now we just takes half of the screen

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,600
okay let's finally write some stuff in

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:23,800
so we want our meetup to happen in Sirte

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:32,910
ball we want it to be next Friday it

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:38,410
will be a fun meet up yet you know calm

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:40,290
this scription of meetup right so we

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:45,400
create a record basically is what we do

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:47,200
that record and then we will branch back

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,560
to page one and that record is now in

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,890
our table so it says action process your

00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,590
that kind of in counterintuitive we can

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,390
go to where that happened and say

00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:08,650
instead of action process let's say a

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:10,330
nicer one like event was added right so

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:14,800
let's just add another event just for

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:21,120
fun this should be somewhere else and

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:25,960
the rathaus another date the type of

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,590
information a BC this is again a very

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,640
simple just a form and a table so we can

00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:35,440
create the other record it's gonna say

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,630
event was added and now we're back on

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,770
page one and we see all of this report

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:44,620
again we can filter it so we can say sir

00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,510
table and now we only get the results

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,450
that have certain belen it so this is a

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:52,029
widget basically that shows the

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,759
inside of a table you don't need any

00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,049
libraries it comes out of the box let's

00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,329
see we have two more minutes what can I

00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:01,179
do in two minutes

00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:03,039
mm-hmm we can change something the the

00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,979
color blue here I don't like it

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,409
let's make it more free code campus so

00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:12,099
we can go in our page designer and write

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:14,829
actual CSS so let's say on the page

00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:17,109
level we go down and we have this little

00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:19,479
CSS stuff so we can actually go here and

00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:21,759
write inline CSS which will get added to

00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:24,579
the page but apex does make it a bit

00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,339
simpler for us so instead of the header

00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:30,099
accent which is the most common color we

00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:37,209
can go around and say I think the free

00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:44,789
code camp one is dark green to tomb save

00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:52,440
as beta copy save set as current theme

00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:52,440
thank you and that changes the refresh

00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:57,549
that changes the primary color of the

00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,619
application so not just the stop bar but

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,529
also see wherever the primary color was

00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:03,820
used now this this color will be used so

00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:06,190
they have all of these declarative

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,039
options like little clicks everywhere we

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,190
can go around and write actual code

00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:14,200
right CSS but or we can use their tools

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,450
all of their crazy little buttons that

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,409
they have here and make something like

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:24,999
this happen one last thing we could also

00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:26,649
let's go back to home we could please

00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:30,279
click this little debug button to go

00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:33,099
into debug mode for example which might

00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,690
take some time let's see the deep

00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:36,190
debugging information from this page

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,739
because we really we don't even know

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,049
what codes really got executed something

00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:43,209
static went to something dynamic somehow

00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:45,039
through magic but actually there is some

00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:49,599
process that draws this webpage in the

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,669
back let's click on this entry and here

00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,349
we actually see all of the functions

00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:57,099
that were executing in the background so

00:29:53,349 --> 00:30:00,009
that this page does get executed in

00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:02,259
terms of what we have here this is the

00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,220
time that something took so we see that

00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,409
the most consumed

00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,900
aspect of this page was the query for

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,190
that table but and there's all this code

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,440
here but we didn't have to write any of

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,409
it it just gets executed behind so in

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,260
case the page is ever slow you can go

00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:19,919
here and see why that page is slow and

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,620
try to improve that query or something

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,760
so that was just a quick little app

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,659
there's everything you need without

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,900
writing a single line of code

00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:34,750
authentication pages routing through the

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,730
pages from this one to that one just

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,520
with simple widgets it can get really

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,409
crazy and make an application that looks

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,330
like Facebook if you want to go around

00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,460
and change the HTML templates that this

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,780
is based on but most people just stick

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,940
with the basic one because they don't

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:52,750
have to work that much and still provide

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:59,230
a proper application I have one last

00:30:52,750 --> 00:31:01,860
slide the conclusion it is fast there is

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,240
no code involved I've mentioned that

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,340
there are jobs on the market for this

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,710
type of technology especially Oracle

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:12,280
apex I'm not sure about this out systems

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,429
guys they might as well so yeah there's

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,929
lots of vacancies everywhere and

00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:18,400
especially also for junior positions

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:19,750
they're always looking because it's easy

00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,150
to learn so they know that they don't

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:25,030
have to train their employees a lot to

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,620
get them to do something and then last

00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,289
point it is not an oversaturated

00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,809
community so for example let's say you

00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:33,760
start building something you integrate

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,590
some JavaScript library in it or

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,110
something make a little cool project or

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,760
something interesting blog about it put

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,919
it on Twitter you will immediately get a

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,630
following even the people from Oracle

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,630
who built apex they will immediately

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,610
follow you so it's not like I don't know

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,650
angular or react where there's thousands

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,260
upon thousands it is a smaller community

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:59,880
and it's it makes things more intimate

00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:59,880
in a way and yeah thanks

00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,059
