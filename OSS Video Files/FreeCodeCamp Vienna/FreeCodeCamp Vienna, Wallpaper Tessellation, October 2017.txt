photo Couture no okay

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,050
for free code camp and my first talk was

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,300
about your setting up and developing a

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,870
full-stack application and so and this

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,190
is just a simple talk about wallpaper

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,590
tessellations so what of all Piper

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,239
tessellations actually that's what

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,730
you're gluing on the world stage to

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,430
Peyton may okay yeah and these are

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,440
repeating patterns found in nature and

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,469
you see them on the floor on the toilet

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,170
in the bathroom maybe on your shirt in

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:58,280
the Internet yeah and this is a sample

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,280
for tessellation like honeycomb Oh

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,550
next slide yeah there's some more

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,640
samples actually this this artist called

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,840
Asia okay I think he's dead now and yeah

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:13,439
actually hit it only periodic

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,840
tessellation see he went to Spain to see

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,610
the Alhambra and he get inspired okay I

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,759
want to do the same thing he said to

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:25,280
himself with animals okay and then he

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,900
drew animals and a lot of yeah

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,850
how it works okay you can do this at

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,210
home you take a paper you cut this out

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:38,240
put its there on with some tape there

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,240
and there for this desolation okay and

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,570
it's not hard yeah and actually I wrote

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,259
the program okay there's a screenshot

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,200
and you will see it soon life okay it's

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,090
just you okay I'll show you the okay

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,350
it's it's it's time to show you the

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,350
program yeah

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,400
now it's full screen okay

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,350
hello nice that you were here because it

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,660
was for inspiring myself okay

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,730
and I am showing how this program is

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,700
working though just mirror it then I can

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,940
I write the code Oh No

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:35,520
yeah and then I show this background

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:37,650
here and you can copy this code and yeah

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,250
you can copy this or this code and use

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:49,800
it at your home page mm-hmm

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:54,300
echoing back to the presentation okay

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,700
because it's time for the next no it's

00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,750
time for the legs right okay this

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,420
created these are some forms F created

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,840
with this program okay

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,519
actually the forms getting crazy at the

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,120
the less you know how this program works

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:18,540
like crazy other forms okay every

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:21,930
testing yeah okay just you get this code

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,750
sample from the program copy the code in

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:30,810
and name it per say crazy total switch

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:37,140
Iowa and you have a nice peachy okay how

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,600
to use it with CSS yeah okay well your

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,500
SVG repeat and you have it in the

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,070
background okay it's quite simple make

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,410
use of it in JavaScript yeah that's what

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,750
you're right just copy the code or you

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,579
can get my slide it's online

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,739
multiple times it's on github it's on

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,280
slash slideshare.net that it's

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,350
everything okay yeah and you just copied

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,019
this I'll copy and paste it and it will

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:09,690
do it okay and that's how it looks like

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:13,109
if you take the page 64 okay and I

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,290
recommend to use it pays 64 coded

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:19,680
because they are those apples

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:25,140
and so on okay and it's not looking that

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,090
better you used it yeah even some

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,340
defense and I was like no I passed ROVs

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,130
confusion is it going to rate and change

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,320
during program execution cannot be

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,320
confused with existing code standard

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,690
base64 encode errs can be used okay so

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,480
you can even take some SVG code and

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,540
decode it to page 64 and then use it in

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,650
your program yeah that's important okay

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:53,370
because you can even contribute to this

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:57,720
and you can fork it link it make your

00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,090
own make it better you can post your

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:05,640
make your comments on Twitter or there

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,330
and it's everything okay okay yeah I'm

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,330
finished

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,520
yeah thank you for it didn't suppose

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,800
this data that's how you make it picked

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,720
also I'll tell slides okay nice pictures

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,070
maybe some jokes and then you're done
