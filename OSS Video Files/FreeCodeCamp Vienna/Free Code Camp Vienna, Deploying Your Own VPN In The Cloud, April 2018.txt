thank you everyone for coming my name is

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,970
Robert axelsson besides from organizing

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,630
this Meetup I'm also going to give a

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,170
talk to you today on the topic on the

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,030
topic of deploying a VPN every pn is a

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,980
virtual private network that enable is

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:22,320
it for you to connect to that server or

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,449
that network from your connection when

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,539
you are connected to the internet and it

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,019
gives room for you to encrypt your data

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:34,620
and also to bypass as a proxy if your

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,890
server VPN network is in the US it will

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,860
appear most probably for the person that

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,230
you are accessing the website at for

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,140
example cnn.com or whatever that you are

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,520
coming from the US and not from Austria

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:51,809
but let's get into the details and why

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,559
I'm mentioning this today what I'm going

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,000
to cover in specifics is outline which

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,390
is a tool that enables you to set up

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,629
your own virtual private network we'll

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,400
get to the specific soon my name is

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,689
robert axl since as I mentioned you can

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,490
find me at Rob Axelsson on most of the

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,590
things I didn't realize I put this in

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,960
here but I am actually on all the things

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,729
at on all the things as well I haven't

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,470
started using it actively but I have it

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,479
everywhere and it's an alliance for now

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,420
I might do something fun with it

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,170
but it was just available I'm at I'm on

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,450
all the things at on all the things I am

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,119
a software developer a meetup organizer

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,329
and a community enthusiast I like

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,150
creating and starting and organizing

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,299
meetups I now run three monthly meetups

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,850
as you know as I mentioned before yeah

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,299
if you want to learn more about mine and

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:52,259
also Corgan eyes with daniel deutsches

00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:54,479
journey from learning to program to code

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,399
to getting our first developer job which

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,590
we did recently over the last couple

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,130
couple of years both me in him you can

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,509
look online at my website you'll find

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,429
links to recordings of that talk with it

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,140
ok enough about me

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,800
slides for this talk are already

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,780
available online in a repo

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,670
so have a look there also for the ones

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,290
looking at the recordings just head on

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,860
over there and you can look at the

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,350
slides together no need to take notes

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,730
what inspired this talk for me was

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,030
recently I think within the last week

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,330
there was episode YouTube at hack 5

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,130
which by the way is a great YouTube

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,150
channel a big shout out to them if

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,490
you're interested in security or

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,370
penetration testing or hacking be it

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,200
white hat - a hat or black hat have a

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,000
look at that channel they've been around

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,730
forever and there's some really great

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,610
stuff there down to beginner intros on

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,100
what to do in the command line to using

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,530
Kali Linux and all kinds of stuff so I

00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,970
really really really recommend to have a

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,640
look if you have any interest in that

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:07,020
topic ok so before we get into the tool

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,430
that we're gonna use let's get a little

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,610
bit of see a little bit serious and

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:18,090
let's talk about a guy named John so

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:20,700
John a 27 year old journalist ever since

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,380
he was a young teen he learned about the

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,570
widespread corruption in this country

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:30,000
after experiencing it firsthand himself

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:32,130
he has been driven to stop it John from

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,170
an early age again he volunteered to

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,530
help with the school paper and he

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,820
learned that he had a talent for writing

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,770
it was only natural to him that he

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,720
applied to study journalism in the

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,940
capital in the university in the capital

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,350
of his country and he was ecstatic when

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,930
he got accepted like this is awesome

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,820
so John again after having studied for a

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,360
couple of years he graduated with flying

00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:01,320
colors he easily got a job at the top

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,180
newspaper in his country and John he was

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,400
on a path he was really destined to be

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,230
to get a great career career but he

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,360
wanted something more

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,730
he's dis-ease there should have been a

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,010
dash here because it looks like he has a

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:21,090
disease so sorry for that but his this

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,669
is with a - regarding corruption has

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,400
never really faded since his teens but

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,389
his country had only a resemblance of a

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,909
free press

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,840
and writing about corruption was a best

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:39,840
friend upon still he felt repelled to

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,699
speak up then out of the blue so John

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,840
was suddenly contacted by an anonymous

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:51,210
source that had him introduced to John

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,490
via common friend and led to believe

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,039
that he kill help disclosed scandal then

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,610
involved highly powerful men and their

00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:03,389
corruption in their country so John

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,389
agreed to meet a secret location was

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:08,789
really pond and they met and John was

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,819
both shocked and repulsed by the scandal

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:16,669
his source revealed but he knew he get

00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:18,659
had to get a story publish the end

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,909
shortly after the meeting John

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,750
mysteriously went missing and John's

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:27,509
story was never published even though

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,400
this is a fictional story clearly

00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,479
written by me today

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:37,650
mixing past and present tense and not a

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:42,990
work of great we'll get to that

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:46,250
afterwards nor the work of great writing

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,319
talent it tells the story that I think

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:54,870
the people behind outline wants to tell

00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:59,550
and help mitigate to confuse you I'll

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:03,300
jump back in my slides because I think

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,659
I'm missing or there is also so outline

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,930
was released now in March of this year

00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:14,460
by jigsaw which is alphabets cyber

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,889
security division supposedly by

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,319
TechCrunch stating it's their

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,879
cybersecurity division looked a little

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,710
bit into it it looks more like they're

00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,110
an incubator under alphabet alphabet

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,870
owns Google if you didn't know so this

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,909
is Google backed that has to do with

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:37,199
geopolitical issues and how to help the

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:40,529
world or people better protect those

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,310
spaces so not strictly cybersecurity but

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,340
it definitely there

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:48,630
philately falls under that domain yes

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:53,670
that's jigsaw I wanted this talk to be a

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:56,010
bit again back to the title deploy to be

00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,690
a bit interactive I want to state this

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:03,510
because I'll get back to it later

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:05,070
this talk is this YouTube video 717

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,020
minutes long and we'll cover some stuff

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,300
that I won't cover today what we'll

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,640
cover now together is going to the

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:16,470
website downloading the tool and then

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,870
installing it and setting up our own VPN

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,200
and hopefully the demo gods are with us

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:26,810
and the internet is stable and we'll see

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,640
if we can get this done so let's do this

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,470
our two links we need there one is the

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,670
website to download it the other one is

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:40,160
my referral link to the place we can use

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:42,840
us for hosting a VPS for hosting this

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,360
keep in mind if you use this link you

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,490
will get $10 credit I will get some

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
credit on my part if you prefer not to

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,450
do it it'll be apparent later on in the

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,670
talk where you can go to do it without

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:58,040
involving me I want that to be perfectly

00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:02,130
clear because I'm not doing this yeah

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,560
for those reasons and I just a super

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,810
quick shout out we my company are

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,630
looking for both front end and back end

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:13,140
developers if you are interested here

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:17,580
are the details contact me email or

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:19,620
check on the website yeah I'm a

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,690
front-end developer in my team we use

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:29,150
vue.js javascript mainly have a look if

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,740
you're interested cool so let's do this

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,630
it's as simple as using the link going

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,670
to get outline org

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,050
they are framing this for journalists

00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,090
but keep in mind you could use this

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,300
yourself you would have to pay for the

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:46,050
hosting we'll get into that as a monthly

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,210
cost but when you have set it up you can

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,210
buy click of a few buttons send a link

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:55,110
to your friend or contact whatever you

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:58,920
want to connect with via a VPN

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:01,110
encrypted securely and privately as you

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,600
can get there's always potential

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,029
loopholes and with humans involved and

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,560
attack vectors like I want I cannot

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:11,010
stand on state to say you will be

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,920
hundred percent secure but as secure as

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,839
we can get in this day and age and then

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,670
you can invite them and they'll be

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,700
connected via your VPN and you can

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:24,899
safely communicate with them one thing

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,630
to add about what we're going to do or

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,050
note the reason for using such a tool is

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:34,110
not just for journalists if you are

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,200
connected let's say in at Starbucks

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,730
which is notoriously one of the examples

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,410
for you shouldn't check your online

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,329
banking if you're a Starbucks or any

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,029
open Wi-Fi network because anyone that

00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,380
just puts up a computer and no something

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:50,040
they can sniff the data and they'll

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,350
figure all this stuff out this is a

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,700
safest you can get by still being

00:09:52,350 --> 00:10:00,269
connected in a public open Wi-Fi first

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,839
before you share anything private or

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:06,300
sensitive you connect via the VPN and

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,930
then you proceed to communicate what you

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,459
want it to be hidden or you log into

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,660
your online bank or you log into

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,089
Facebook or whatever you don't want

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,579
anyone else to possibly be able to snoop

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:22,290
read so that's also a use case besides

00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:24,300
the journalism stuff so we just scroll

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,449
down and we go to get lot outlet

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,050
managers there's by the way also mobile

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:32,730
clients hak5 mentioned that it's not

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,390
covered on all the devices for me it

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:39,380
seems like so but there might be some

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:42,769
some caveats there but for our

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:47,220
demonstration now we'll just go and get

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:49,529
for Linux you can also download so you

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,350
can initially set this up we have Izzard

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,540
on Windows or Mac OS and we'll see why

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,940
that is the case it's downloading down

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,220
here now and over half the way through

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,570
so we'll just wait for that in the

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,570
meantime I'll get up a terminal

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:12,149
and will soon get going so for those of

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,350
you who aren't so tactical or you don't

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,420
even have to be technical to know to

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,130
understand what's going on right now but

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,930
I'm on Linux and what I do now might

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,019
seem esoteric the only thing I'm doing

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,820
is opening the file so and windows you

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,860
would just double-click the egg Exe file

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,779
and what would happen by itself a little

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,510
bit more complicated here but it's just

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:35,640
the couple of lines of code or command

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:39,600
line commands so I just have to give it

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:46,350
I won't go into details the one that

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:53,029
knows what this is knows it so now I'll

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:53,029
just execute it apparently not

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,900
okay

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,400
yeah

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,579
what

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:41,270
plus-x thank you shout out to however

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:47,150
spotted the error we got it now there we

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:50,600
go so hey we get it let's see maybe I'll

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,090
break it now yeah we cannot maximize it

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,400
so this is the biggest we get I'll go a

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,590
step back because I see it knows I

00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,750
already started this earlier today so

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,490
I'll sign out this is what it will look

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,590
like for you when you just open this up

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,880
the first time it does expect you to

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:09,440
have an account that digital ocean

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,560
digital ocean is a VPS a virtual private

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,360
server provider they compete in the

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,270
space against the Amazon and Google

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,770
Cloud and so on they more are in the

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,040
business of giving you a dedicated

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:24,950
virtual server at them the certain

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,420
amount of power and then you pay per

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,960
month and you do whatever you want with

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,760
them and with it you can start as low as

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,330
five dollars a month and that's what

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,550
this is based on so you have to pay five

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,230
dollars to try this out first you do

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,210
create an account you can do that via

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:47,600
here or you can use the link I mentioned

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:49,700
rubley go do and you get $10 credit to

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:57,590
start this out right now I just have to

00:13:49,700 --> 00:14:03,200
sign in awesome I don't think you have

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:06,860
to agree to any gdpr compliance and sign

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:11,540
any papers to see my email but this we

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:15,470
had a talk before let me just get my

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:19,100
mobile ready so I can do the second two

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,550
factor authentication here and I have to

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:27,260
change the password if this doesn't work

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:30,730
but we should be covered so you see you

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,730
see my second email awesome

00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:43,180
you can hear from the way I'm typing

00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:47,199
what my password is awesome awesome so I

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:51,920
just gotta get my one of my account

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:55,670
passwords awesome so so you create your

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,920
account and you just sign in now it

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,910
might prompt me for something awesome so

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,910
give me one second

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,650
okay so here's the magic and this is

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:20,880
where I found this really great for our

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:23,370
meetup today that with this digital

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,740
ocean you can choose a country that's

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,540
the server is in that's also on topic

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,120
today you can choose it to be in the EU

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,060
for example and also we're very close to

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,090
Frankfurt so that's awesome

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,520
then I'm pressing the button and I'm

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,050
telling you to set it up for me it is

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,470
doing that and this might take two

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,270
minutes it says while we're doing that

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,730
once this is done what we will see will

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,950
be inside my digital ocean account and

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:54,060
then we'll see that it actually has

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:56,730
created a new server and if you are

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,370
interested if you do this it's an entry

00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,900
port to be able to log in to your own

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,100
server and get a little bit of feel

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,270
about linux is and system administration

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,460
because it starts with these small

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,410
experiments it did for me I was like

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,260
what is this VPS can i host besides

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:18,210
using Hostgator or one and one or one of

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,550
these hosting providers how much

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,940
knowledge would it need to do it on my

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,560
own

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,870
and before I learned to program the a

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,540
free code camp I took a course at Linux

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:31,230
Academy and learned to host via the lamp

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:35,670
stack limit Linux Apache my sequel and

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,950
PHP using these kind of tools online and

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,840
if I didn't want to use the VPS anymore

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,760
after a day I could just destroy it I

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,920
don't only pay for that one or two days

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,740
but it's a great way for learning these

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,980
kind of things now we see that there is

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,300
already so this kept going on in the

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,110
background I'm just going to refresh for

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,730
the sake of clarity what this did in the

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,710
background was that this is my normal

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,030
server and I'm giving you the IP address

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,120
this is awesome so you should probably

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,130
change that it's fine it's fine if you

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,209
know my domain name you can find this IP

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,800
address publicly available this is the

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,709
one on the server that it created this

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,870
is its unique IP address so if you try

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,750
to attack this IP address as a hacker or

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:22,970
whatever what you are just directing at

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,970
is the VP M

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,970
server that we just set up by clicking

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,100
above so it can be done magically easy

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,580
like this now the thing I won't go into

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,320
detail upon now is how you would share

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,660
this because the video that I mentioned

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,610
earlier then I have a link to goes into

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,950
better detail of explaining this and for

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,840
me to demo this on this desktop I would

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,840
need also to have a shared screen of a

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,120
phone or another desktop to show the

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,040
interaction what's going on right so

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,059
that does that much better we can do

00:17:52,040 --> 00:18:01,090
that at a key part I'm not connected

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,090
okay get connected connect this device

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,770
okay

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,809
it gives us some stuff to install so I

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,850
won't do that now with you because

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:21,320
that's to doesn't give you anything the

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,390
only thing we see after this is done is

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,690
that I can click a key to share with

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:30,170
someone else but we have done the hard

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,420
part already believe me so we're almost

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,480
done we're almost true but keep in mind

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,250
that you can use something like

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,850
digitalocean to do these kind of things

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,760
on your own either for a VPN and you can

00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,429
be ready in a second or you can do it

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,920
for different services if you want to

00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:52,910
host WordPress on your own if you're

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,860
interested in trying out Linux if you

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,070
want to do something like you've heard

00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,770
about this ghost alternative to

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,630
WordPress or you want to set up instead

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,880
of github you want to set up gitlab for

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,830
yourself for your team if you want to

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,460
play around with my sequel there's a lot

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,830
of stuff that are already there for you

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:18,400
with a click of a button mean stack for

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:21,080
example is MongoDB nginx angular and

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,020
nodejs so on topic for free code camp

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,330
it's a Java Script paste and if I click

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,120
here now so I've chosen that one I can

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:33,050
say I want the minimum one I want to

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,220
have it in Frankfurt and I want to have

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,220
ipv6 and

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:43,990
I want to add my HQ always a public key

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,310
is fine and I can give it a name and

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,080
create and it goes through the same

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,700
process again and I'm gonna done with

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,560
this I get an IP address

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,200
I can SSH into it that means that I can

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,110
connect to it from my laptop and I can

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,960
be in an environment where I can do

00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:01,990
start from the command line to put stuff

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,110
on my server to host stuff create an app

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,580
and already have it available in IP so I

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,260
don't have to just have localhost on my

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,290
computer so there's tons of

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,590
possibilities but that starts by being

00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:16,420
curious about what virtual private

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,860
services what Linux is and how you can

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,260
do these things on your own and believe

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:24,220
me when I say anyone can learn it I

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,670
could I got it working and digitalocean

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:32,050
to top it off also has a great

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:37,390
I can't further find a link to it but

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:38,860
they have a great article base or they

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,350
have a lot of how to use on how to do

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:45,400
these things step by step really step by

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:47,050
step anyone can do this and you can also

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,910
use these tutorials and I really

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,860
recommend it even if you are not curious

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,420
about digitalocean at all if you're

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,660
using something else I would like to use

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,940
another provider they have a great

00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,060
reputation for having really top-notch

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,350
articles and I go to them off and just

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,960
if there's something I'm curious about

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,940
myself and oh how do I do this I often

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,790
first go to digital ocean so enough

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,040
about them but I really mean it when I

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:16,470
say have a look there if you're curious

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:22,890

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:26,019
