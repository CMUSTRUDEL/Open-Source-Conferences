my name is Robert oxytocin as I said you

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,770
can find me on most of things that Rob

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:11,040
axelsson I'm a software developer by day

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,790
by profession I learned to code mainly

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:19,910
be a free code camp meetup we are at now

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:22,650
is for free code camp dot org and I also

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,410
organize meetups this meetup here and

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,869
also of IANA Go Go like meet up and view

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,900
jazz Vienna when I really love being

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,989
around the open-source and developer

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,300
geek community so I keep doing this

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,219
because it's ultimately fun if you want

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,829
to learn more about mine and Daniel's

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,930
journey to going from learn to code and

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,789
getting a first developer job you can go

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,890
to my website and there's a link to our

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,300
talk there okay so let's go straight

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,520
into it the first obstacle that you

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,879
might meet and to preface it these

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,250
obstacles are mainly based on my own

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,649
experience and talking to people

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,350
fellow coach students this is by no

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,420
means as of this talk an exhaustive list

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,850
so please feel free again in the

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:14,490
questions section to ask we'll leave

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,350
room for questions after the talk so

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,840
when you're dealing with time the time

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,729
might be an issue because I think

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,560
starting out is easy to think that oh

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,689
you know I'll put like three weeks into

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
this and I really focus and maybe I

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,080
learn a lot and then you realize after

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,860
three months that oh god there's so much

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,100
to learn so there's different ways that

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,450
time can hit you in the face but I think

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,590
there are some things to keep in mind do

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,850
not get too overwhelmed or too impatient

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,860
one thing is to accept that learning

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,439
takes time yes it doesn't take too long

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,909
to learn the basics of programming

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,740
that's one thing that I struggle with on

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,119
the opposite of time was that I thought

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:59,159
it would take both the mind of a genius

00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:01,200
you know what's it called prodigy or a

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,829
really really long time and math skills

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:09,660
to learn to program but I kept having to

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,760
face that myth or misconception and I

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,860
gradually learned that no it's easier to

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,750
learn I thought to learn the basics

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,900
but once you have the basics what you

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,670
really need to focus on is repetition

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,210
repetition and getting better and just

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,100
doing a lot so things will take time but

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,300
to get the basics and get up to speed it

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,920
doesn't necessarily have it takes a long

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,220
time but just manage your expectations

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,870
and that learning the code it's not

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,470
something to do on a whim and you need

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,840
to be ready to commit maybe you know

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,040
several months a half a year a year

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,340
depending on what you want to get out of

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,260
programming if you want to learn to code

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:52,080
definitely think longer than two weeks

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,610
in learning to code you can also get

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,739
trapped into spending too much time on

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,110
stuff that might you might realize

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:03,239
afterwards weren't giving you as much I

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:06,320
weren't as beneficial to you so you

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,060
should instead of forcing yourself to

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,030
stick with the course you found you

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,410
should rather try and try different

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,020
courses different books different

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,160
different learning formats and see what

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,810
works for you and what some of the

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,360
combinations of resources and courses

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,400
and curriculum and teachers etc might

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,750
speed up things for you so don't be

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,480
afraid to experiment again realistic

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,370
time frame we already talked about and

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,780
it helps to form helpful habits so

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,180
instead of sitting down and forcing

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,860
yourself to learn for two hours if you

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,750
have habits in place and routines where

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,810
it's not an issue it's not a struggle to

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,549
get started it makes it easier it's not

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,130
easy to form habits it takes commitment

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,530
in the beginning but once it's habits it

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,640
makes it it's a habit it's much easier

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,110
just to get going daft

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,330
is one thing that you can be faced with

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,430
I think especially when you're thinking

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,680
about applying for jobs even when you've

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,870
got your first job or when you've

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,519
started study like I had a wall after

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,500
like three four months of starting if we

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,540
go camp I was like god dammit can I

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,810
really do this there's so much left to

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,100
learn

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:20,370
I loved eating success stories for

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,410
breakfast I still do there's tons of

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,630
success stories and free code camp the

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,250
medium publication if you just google it

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,570
online there's so much stuff out there

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,690
just talk to people

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,850
the audience today and just remember

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,390
that everyone started somewhere so even

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,950
the most you know accomplished developer

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,530
out there or even the most accomplished

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:45,650
speaker such less persona and whatever

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:47,940
pick your programming language stage

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,770
started somewhere some people yes

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,540
started when they were almost starting

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,060
to walk in us like four or five year

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,800
olds but most people started later in

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,300
life and there's tons of success stories

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,450
of people starting when they were twenty

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,850
thirty forty fifty there was recently a

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,440
great article by Quincy Larson the

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,560
founder of free code camp on just that

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,230
topic even for experienced developers

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,760
Google is your best friend so if you're

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,500
doubting how to do this someone else

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,150
probably have also asked the same

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,770
question can I really do what I was

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,660
tasked to do right now or what I chose

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:25,140
to create so don't be afraid to Google

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,120
all the time the only entity haters it

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,100
depends a bit about on your family and

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,370
your friends I've been blessed to not

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,740
have so many people questioning why I

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,180
was learning to code or what what's why

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,550
have you learning to code and stuff like

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,580
this but I know some people had that

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,170
issue and it's not easy to just ignore

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,100
them if their important part of your

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:50,250
life but don't give them too much that

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,440
their opinions too much value and yes

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,790
you can we have again success stories

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,340
tons of stories here today of people

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,830
that have dealt with doubt and still

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,700
have overcome and managed to learn to

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:04,620
code resources mentioning this it ties

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,220
into some of the other things we've

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,520
discussed when you are faced with doubt

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,860
or time constraints also in the

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,050
beginning but when you are hitting a

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,730
wall and feeling like oh free code camp

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,470
this may be not for me or you're doing

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,140
another online course or you're reading

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,660
a book and you're getting stuck don't be

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,270
afraid to question the resource that you

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,530
are using to learn to code I

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,200
supplemented free code camp first with

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:35,419
eloquent JavaScript a book and then

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,100
gradually more with udemy video courses

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,200
but just don't be afraid to experiment

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,040
this tons of free resources there's tons

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,110
of cheap courses

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,240
so the main focus on how to deal with

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,180
resources is don't be afraid to test out

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,090
things and switch it up but on the other

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,940
flipside don't get too fragmented like

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,800
there's the shiny object syndrome of

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,750
course you might try to buy every new

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
fancy course and think that that's going

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,070
to be the blue tail that's going to get

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,000
you from A to B in two weeks doesn't

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,560
work like that but find something that

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
works for you and when you find

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,060
something stick with it

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,940
it can also help to have a mentor it's

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,430
not always so easy to find an absence of

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,500
that Co students can be in my experience

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,090
really good to just meet regularly at

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,370
meetups take an initiative to meet

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,400
people for coffee and some talking about

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:34,350
code to you know give each other

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,000
feedback and to have this social sort of

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,740
pressure to when you meet someone the

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,900
next time oh I should have completed

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,060
that JavaScript calculator let me just

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,280
do that before I meet them tomorrow and

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,870
their programming is worth trying if you

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,370
haven't there's a lot of online

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,800
communities where you can meet people

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,360
and pair program for a session you can

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,860
also meet people in real life pair

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,180
programming is sitting together with

00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,330
someone else and coding on the same

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:02,970
thing on one screen normally just to not

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,010
bore you too much I took in a bonus

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,170
point here an obstacle we're learning to

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,840
code can be vim if you don't know what

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,000
women is it's a code editor in the

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,790
terminal spin around since the beginning

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,010
of the UNIX times or not so long but

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,640
it's been around for a couple of decades

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,190
and it's infamously infamous for being

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,900
hard to exit out of so if you just open

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,000
it up and you don't know how to exit out

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,970
of it you probably will not figure out

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,370
and you close your terminal but this is

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,350
more of a joke than a real obstacle if

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,060
you want to know how to exit them this

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:41,900
is how you exit them just to have that

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,900
included

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:54,639
so you literally just to escape to have

00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:57,610
the command section and then you have :

00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,589
q an exclamation mark but you might be

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,740
normally fine without the exclamation

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,379
mark it sounds simple but on the other

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,040
hand it sounds may be unnecessary when

00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:11,889
you just gonna exit something so let's

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
get back on track distractions it's

00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,540
another thing as we're emitting in life

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,129
especially with the infamous Millennials

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,029
and all the distractions we have these

00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:23,949
days it's easy to sit down and you were

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,449
going to learn to code today and then

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:28,000
two hours later you've been checking

00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:31,750
everything on YouTube and all the latest

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,120
JavaScript news or whatever it's a bit

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,970
tricky one because again for me what

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,199
helps the most is I realized the one

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,290
thing I haven't put here I'll mention

00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,850
that but its habits again if you manage

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,730
to do stuff for the right reasons and

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,139
also form the habits that you need to

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:52,059
have the routine that works for you like

00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:55,000
every Friday like every morning for 20

00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:57,220
minutes at lunch or in the evening

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,680
before you watch your favorite TV series

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,420
or whatever that you just stick with

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,300
some routines and routines and follow

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,160
them I like really the routine of just

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,509
sticking with free code camp and getting

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,579
the points and getting the brownie

00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:12,399
points if I help people at free core cam

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:14,589
torg via the chat room you get brownie

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,410
points with people thank you I'm just

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:19,629
kind of kept like wanting that

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,269
statistics of my points to go up that

00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:25,290
was the motivating force one thing I

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:27,519
didn't put up here is that it helps to

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,360
know I got distracted so I forgot what

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,129
it was so we'll get back to that and

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,750
then again to the better resources I

00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:37,209
think that's the theme of this talk now

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,889
but if you get distracted it might be

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:41,439
because the course is not the best fit

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,720
for you maybe you would do better

00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:47,129
reading a book for an hour than for

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,870
following something video or maybe

00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:52,089
tutorials we get to do stuff as you go

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,339
along is better for you and so on and

00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,750
also one thing yeah that's actually it

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,449
is here but just didn't realize the

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,080
thing that I forgot is work on your why

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,260
so

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,760
you feel lacking motivation or being

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,260
distracted too easily it might be

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,080
because you're lacking motivation we

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,910
need to learn to code you might rethink

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,410
why you're learning to code and if it's

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,450
really the right thing for you now maybe

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,100
it's a better fit in a year to be honest

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,230
something happened you're like oh no I

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,180
need to do this for other reasons but if

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,940
you don't either have the passion for

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,980
programming code these kind of things or

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,200
you have the right ways to do it it will

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,120
be harder it's just a fact so you can

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,700
still do it you just need to figure out

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,350
how to work on that for you I've been

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:37,600
blessed that I've been loving computer

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:39,360
since I could walk and tap on keyboards

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,350
I just didn't get into programming until

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,000
the last yeah recently well both will

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,250
say the questions were after because we

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,580
are filming so it's not so easy to take

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,820
the questions during the filming but

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,160
just keep them if you had some getting

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:01,090
stuck again we've covered this sort of

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,700
and we've covered switching up one thing

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,450
I want to focus on is that if you feel

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,070
like you're you were committing to a

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,230
course or a material and you're like

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,480
yeah but I can't give up I'm so invested

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,960
in this for whatever reason it's fine

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,610
you can just stop try something else

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,050
and it might work you might even return

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,730
to where you were because you learned

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,410
something from a different perspective I

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,300
had that experience with eloquent

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,130
JavaScript reading that for several

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,350
chapters and I got the same things that

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,180
I were explained in free code camp

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,370
curriculum in a different way and it was

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,240
like aha now I felt more equipped to

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,800
tackle the course afterwards

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,180
debugging is a thing where it depends on

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,650
what you're coding in it depends a bit

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:50,590
on you and how strict you are on

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:52,600
debugging with debugging tools in the

00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,670
beginning or not there are different

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,470
opinions on this but whichever way you

00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,090
are debugging with your language with

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:05,470
your tool set of tools

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:07,170
it helps getting better at figuring out

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,580
why your code is not working right now

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,850
Google again as we talked about if

00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,200
you're doing front-end

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,410
the chrome developer tools and getting

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:22,770
better at breakpoints and debugging have

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:23,970
a debugger as a as variable name or like

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,440
a method that you hook into your

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,460
JavaScript and it stops in the browser

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,260
to give you the to stop in time where

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,300
you are debugging and those kind of

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,340
things help if you don't know much about

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:40,080
this and I've had problems coding look

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:41,610
into debugging just google it what helps

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,260
for me sometimes and there's been done

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,460
Studies on this if you are coding and

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,800
you feel stuck and this could be

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,000
professionally or learning to code it

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,830
might be good with the context switch

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
where you just force yourself to be like

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,160
but I mean in the middle of this I can

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,050
make this work and then you're an hour

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,720
later I can make this work and you're

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,670
like okay stop just take a break 10 to

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,260
15 minutes go for work do something

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,720
entirely different and you might be like

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,430
but now and then you go back to it or

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,750
just the fact that you had a break you

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,630
go back and you look at it through fresh

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:15,720
eyes very often helps ya Google again

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:18,330
okay so for one of the last points I

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,720
think it's the last obstacle we're going

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:25,260
over today is deflation you might be

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,050
like Oh goddamn it I've I've been trying

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,170
to learn to code for like one week three

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,770
months half a year or more and you feel

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,810
like yeah you need some motivation

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:41,040
you're like maybe it's not for me or

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:42,780
whatever in my experience it helps to go

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,680
to meetups or to socialize with others

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:50,730
again about that also are learning to

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,360
code sometimes it might have to be

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,860
proactive for me and also no Donny

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,800
Danielle it helps to look at

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,390
motivational talks documentaries I love

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,750
these kind of success stories again or

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:06,900
seeing like how this you know seven year

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,420
old kid that was a programming prodigy

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,980
got into college early and just conquer

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,360
the world with his iOS apps and those

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,780
kind of things and I'm like if he can do

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,040
that I can certainly get further in my

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,040
course material and stuff like this

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,240
yeah and ultimately your why so if

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,560
you're if you're kind of stuck ask

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,880
yourself why am I doing this

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,520
maybe I try to do some self motivation

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,740
cool just to make this talk even more

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,660
exciting we are hiring at my company I

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,779
mentioned this before but we're still

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,940
hiring a front end / full stack

00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,430
developer we are also looking for a

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,820
back-end the profile for both is a bit a

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:50,880
little bit more experienced because yeah

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,500
that's the general gist I have a look or

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,730
send us an email if you are interested

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,390
in if you feel you don't have enough

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,420
experience

00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:00,029
feel free to still approach me or send

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:06,510
an email or look at the website it might

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:10,110
still be worth a look for you yeah I

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,420
worked there I yeah do JavaScript

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:20,730
front-end stuff with VJ s mainly at the

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:24,600
moment cool I think yes I think that was

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:29,310
it before we end I want to reinforce and

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,900
I'll follow this up with putting a repo

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,070
in the comment sections because I want

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,980
this talk to be something that people

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,060
can contribute to I realized giving this

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,410
talk that there's a lot of

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,360
repetitiveness and there's some stuff

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,240
that I could maybe when I talking about

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,780
it could want to add myself if people

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,010
have stuff they would like to add or

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,290
feel they can contribute with help on

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,190
how to overcome obstacles you're free to

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,420
help with this talk for the future thank

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,660
you very much

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,660
