my name is viola czar and I am a

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,330
participant at refugee is called we are

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,650
learning there about cs50 and actually

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,870
we are learning first how to become

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,609
ambitious before how to learn to code

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:21,900
and it's quite like learning so fast

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,640
there and it's kind of its kind of

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,180
Awesome being an amazing environment

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,970
there and there we are learning and cs50

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,430
from Harvard which is completely

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,700
different from what developer it's C and

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:41,040
Python and something inside the hardware

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:45,360
software so I would like I'd like what

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,550
since I saw Daniel did a post on

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,879
Facebook about some of someone would

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,070
like to represent something about doing

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
any project is done I would like I did a

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,760
some project here it's a job search

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,600
engine it's connecting with a github

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,879
database so everything every database I

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,790
have it every single detail is

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,860
connecting with a github job this is the

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,430
website I did it it's the front end and

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,600
back entries the back end side is about

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,530
no JavaScript and the mango database and

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,000
the front is I used HTML CSS and

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,740
uncommon framework it's semantic

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,210
framework which is very uncommon so

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,400
anyway if more someone would like to

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,610
search on something I can just easily

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:50,189
type stuff like some kind of job I'll

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:51,990
write something about JavaScript and I

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,540
will use the countryÃ­s

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,810
I suppose there's nothing in Vienna

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,740
because it's a it's a job it's

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,780
connecting with a github which

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,030
everything in America so I will use the

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:11,370
remote they will try it

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:13,080
remote means so there is two kind of job

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,730
so a

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:24,180
here you can see that there is a date

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:26,640
where is the website comes yep and it's

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,630
not quite you cannot see it but here is

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,570
the title of the job and the name of the

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,790
company comes under it and remote eh

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,320
where's the location of it like if it

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,670
could be the New York at somewhere

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,440
anywhere it comes there then type how

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,990
long is this the full time and they'll

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,000
click here for the description it comes

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,690
the description it's which is jQuery I

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,100
used so that you can see it and here if

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,620
you want to apply for it you can't just

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,350
cut with a click here and go to a

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,810
website which I don't want I if you want

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:07,260
to search again and you'd like it this

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:09,120
is the website where I used yeah the

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,720
stick which where I did it I used I used

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,100
in the back end and no JavaScript and

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,380
Express framework and the mango database

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,720
which all of them connecting with the

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,840
backend the front is it was HTML and

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,200
semantic framework and jQuery the truth

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,310
I did it the kid hop get and get hot and

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,380
the hiroko and MBLAQ em lab is with the

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:36,170
people who does not know it

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:39,930
M lap is about a cloud database service

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,070
you can hosting your database on

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,560
it

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,470
the here ok it's a cloud platform you

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,090
can publish your website I published for

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,010
free because it's so domain and you can

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,209
publish it even if it's a domain until

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,120
500 megabyte I would like to go a little

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,540
bit into the code so this is the node

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,120
javascript this is the back end code at

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:09,180
the beginning I give a little bit there

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,670
is for like I said MPM package which I

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,280
requested from the NPM package is

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,700
connecting with an odd JavaScript I

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,709
requested the mangos and requests so

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,460
that I can request it and Express and

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,860
then I assigned the public which is

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,009
connecting with a style sheet and then

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,440
comes whether you are

00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:33,889
they they here is type you can see it

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,490
I'd like to see it to show you this here

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:40,310
speaks those two lines it's this is the

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,039
global URL this is the online URL which

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,039
you cannot see it because it sits inside

00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,650
the Hiroko there you can't it comes the

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,810
name and the password and the name of

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,960
the database if I come published on get

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:58,490
up it's gonna be a disaster and this is

00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,460
the look at your area and this or means

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,860
it's quite good because once you are

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,990
working on a website every changing in

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,410
the locker you don't want it to mix it

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:12,710
with it on your door your deploy website

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:16,039
you deploy tube side then comes the

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,889
search page and the result page where I

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:23,780
as I asked you the request this line

00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:27,370
from the github job and then it comes

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,479
for the request this is the third page I

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:35,240
think it's quite common for some of you

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:41,270
it's an HTML but the classes is semantic

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:46,430
framework and this is also the the

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:51,259
result page you can see here this in

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,349
this line I guess you cannot do it yeah

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:58,009
on this line and other line is here the

00:05:54,349 --> 00:06:02,870
job those are working with the node

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:04,610
JavaScript those are EGS is if you

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,880
wanted to connect if you want to mix it

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:11,780
HTML with a back-end use those kind of

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,389
thing the packages that I use it AGS

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,919
express and the mangoes and the mango

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:21,199
database that if not a month it's you

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,940
cannot you can also not using because

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:28,969
it's also it's something comes with the

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:31,969
command this is the API this is the API

00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:35,960
I request that I can what I can ask from

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:40,180
the github I asked it for when I created

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,180
it this is the timing

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:47,240
and the title the manager director the

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:50,090
location and asked for the time the

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,699
description and how to apply I didn't

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:57,379
ask for the company RL or company logo

00:06:52,699 --> 00:07:00,530
or nothing else so the hero code this is

00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:04,039
Hiroko Hiroko is like I said I used it

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:07,699
for I published my I deployed my website

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:09,439
from Hiroko so it's connecting can you

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,879
notice you noticed can hear you can

00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,000
notice here it's connecting with a

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,819
github and I deploy it from here

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,169
deployed a master branch who are with

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,729
people who are familiar with the gates

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:25,909
hope they can notice its to comment to

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:30,080
connecting to the github thing they get

00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:34,849
hope with the Hiroko the aim lab that a

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,490
page service is also the yeah this is

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:39,560
the database the global one the online

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,719
to take a visit on downline you can see

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,779
here that you can see here is that

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:47,539
database password and the database user

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,699
this is was what was I was talking about

00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:55,460
the title page URL which you cannot see

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:58,550
it it's hidden this one I I took it and

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,710
I put it I make a configuration in the

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,990
hero core so that they can automatically

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:10,189
configuration so yep this was my app

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,599
that I created for you so yeah I guess I

00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,830
present yep

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,260
thank you for this

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,260
