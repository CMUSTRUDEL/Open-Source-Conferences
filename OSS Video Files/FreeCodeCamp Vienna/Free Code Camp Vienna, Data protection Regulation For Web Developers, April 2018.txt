my name is Vlad I'm gonna I'm gonna talk

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,300
about new this new regulation which i

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,910
think is important for pretty much

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,769
everybody who interacts with a computer

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,830
or some kind of a mobile or IOT

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:24,210
connected device louder okay thank you

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,830
right quick quick info about me so maybe

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,340
I'll just start with the question who

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,940
has heard about general data protection

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,190
regulation all right excellent that's

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,559
that's actually really good news a

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,030
couple of thoughts about me so I've just

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,960
started coding

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:46,640
I have also literally I'm on day 96 if

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,890
mine 100 days of code challenge I am

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,840
since last week the the data protection

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,780
officer for the company that I work for

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Zimmer Barnett where I work as a

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,620
business analyst I in principle have

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,629
nothing to do with code but I do handle

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,869
the IT infrastructure over there you can

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,640
find me on github or on Twitter the

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,159
reason why I thought this would be an

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,470
interesting topic is is as you clearly

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,380
will know is the fact that this new

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:21,390
regulation comes into being in May right

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,020
at the 21 and 25th of May and this is

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,610
quite important for for all companies

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,650
from from the smallest ones to really

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,579
like for self-employed from

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,720
self-employed to to huge companies I

00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,490
mean Facebook comes to mind immediately

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,890
I think when I say big companies and

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,619
data protection let's let's let's just

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,360
go right into it so the the the the the

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,430
GD P R has been created in order to get

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,340
up to date with today's technology right

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,799
because there has already been something

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,689
in play right if you read here the the

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,930
aim is to protect all the you citizens

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,079
from privacy and data breaches in our

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,360
increasingly data-driven world which is

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,910
different from the time when the 1995

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,020
directive which has been available until

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,510
now

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,220
right it's vastly different today the

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,670
world we live in today from compared to

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,230
that who does it affect this is also

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,800
quite important this is it's not just

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,610
about companies who are active and

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,550
operating in in the EU area but also

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:33,690
companies outside of the U who in some

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:40,160
way collect or process any data any

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,160
private data from citizens within the EU

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,200
as I've said it's coming into four into

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,329
being with the twenty it's going to

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,750
start being enforced with the 25th of

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:54,209
May there have been in the media for

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,290
example some alarming figures running

00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:05,299
around huge fines up to four percent of

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:08,880
your of a company's what's the word the

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:13,829
turnover annual revenue thank you

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,549
I have to say that related directly

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:21,870
related to that the the training that

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:25,799
I've attended in the training there have

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:28,200
been different ideas running around so

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,930
it's not as strict as it sounds this is

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,750
more of a scare tactic there can be

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,480
massive fine so if you are Facebook yes

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,120
you can you can see something in that

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,130
direction if you have a data breach but

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,709
for a regular company who for example

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,709
has a data breach in terms of losing a

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:50,910
laptop which contains some some private

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,569
data of some some customers or some end

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,730
users or anything like that I have been

00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,790
given the example that a fine is around

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:04,170
five hundred euros so if you fail to to

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:11,330
to register this this breach with with

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:15,800
with authorities right

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:18,769
how do we hit about knowing more about

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,350
yeah knowing how how to implement this

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,270
and actually I'm gonna I'm gonna pass a

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,150
very what I think is a very good

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,580
checklist so maybe you can have a look

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,750
at this this has been downloaded from

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,340
the privacy officers website it's in

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,120
it's available in German and in English

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm gonna have the link in the end so

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,090
there are some austrian websites which

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,360
are which are very well set up and they

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,270
have very good information including

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:54,410
forms including how to's and best

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:58,580
practices but generally it's very well

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:01,430
documented on an on a you level so if

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,340
you can think of the best documentation

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,980
for your favorite let's say programming

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,750
language I would say it's on par with

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,960
that right so so so just google it and

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,690
you will you will come to you will come

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,450
to some answer what are we talking about

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,910
in terms of data processing so we have

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:24,710
in the programming world is the concept

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,690
of crud I would say instead of create

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,850
read update and delete we would we would

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,840
look at collect read update and delete

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:36,190
so it would start from from gaining a

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,710
say access to data all the way to

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:43,130
deleting the data and we will talk more

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:47,570
in more detail about that in a minute

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:50,870
and everything in between what is

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,880
personal data this this this is

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,970
basically any kind of information that

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,300
directly identifies a person regardless

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,820
of their role so be it somebody in there

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,729
literally role as a citizen or their

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,979
role as a employee of company X or Y

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,990
this is this is not important this is

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,690
irrelevant what is relevant is they can

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,190
be identified by it there will be some

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,729
differences between countries for

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:21,229
example I've understood that in Germany

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,910
a person's work phone and email is also

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,890
included in the GDP are so so if you

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,330
access to their work email or their work

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:33,870
phone then it is to be treated with with

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:38,160
this yeah regarding the same kind of

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:41,070
rules and regulations I'm not sure if

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,160
this is the case in Austria but but it's

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,320
a better safe than sorry

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,540
idea I would say that's best applied in

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:54,570
this in such cases if we move on

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,590
straight like in concrete to talk about

00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,840
concrete examples regarding the

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,440
development web development or

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,660
development in general area we have

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,400
identifier x' on line so we have IP

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:14,370
addresses we have cookies and I'm sure

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,590
you can immediately think of five other

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,630
examples if you if you take your

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,820
concrete because I've seen many hands in

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,500
the air when when the question was asked

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,720
who is already working as a web

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,060
developer so let's just make this

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,190
interactive and see who can think of

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,000
other examples from their experience

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:35,070
already at work what can be private

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,290
personal data which can be used to

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,800
identify a person and they've come

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,750
across it either by them realizing oh

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,570
we're storing this in our back-end we're

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,640
storing this in our cloud database which

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,710
which we don't even know if this company

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,600
which is providing the cloud database is

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,490
compliant with the gdpr

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,270
we know we are but we don't know if this

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,700
company that is our third party supplier

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,310
let's say is or is not so does anybody

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:08,720
have any ideas of concrete examples

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,720
maybe from day-to-day work

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:24,080
okay right right okay I yeah I thought

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,870
it's it's easier to make it interactive

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,060
because because then it's the the

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,779
subject the the topic is so dense that

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,940
there's no way I can make justice to it

00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:36,080
within half an hour or or less or

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,380
whatever I don't know how much time I

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,320
have

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,430
so basically interacting and getting you

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,610
to maybe think about it is is actually

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:48,350
better than than just presenting maybe a

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,040
quarter of what I what I could present

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,649
and then at the end you're left only

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,730
with a corner if nobody can think of an

00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:03,070
example I'll just move on so I have some

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,839
some some some cases here websites right

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:09,260
you're gonna have to have a privacy

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,300
policy this has been the case so far but

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,420
the way the privacy policy has to look

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,250
as different nowadays

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,970
into in terms of the GDP are the privacy

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,700
policy has to be in simple English if

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,690
anybody has read a Wikipedia article in

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,940
simple English so it's it has to be

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,829
understandable on on any level not just

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,730
people who have a degree in law for

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:36,709
example or let's say our masochists and

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,589
want to decipher whatever it is that

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:43,630
you've tried to hide in the end in that

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,860
in the in the privacy policy terms

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,870
registration forms right so so this is

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,370
this is the point

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,630
the simplest example that I could think

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,980
of where you could you would be

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:57,640
collecting the data at that point you

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,529
you already have to start thinking about

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,120
the entire process right so if you have

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:06,320
a registration form you're gonna ask for

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,940
a name you're gonna ask for maybe you're

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,350
gonna ask for an email address you're

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,209
gonna ask for a phone number this is

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,209
enough this is sensitive enough this is

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,270
where you have to start thinking okay

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,680
what am I going to do with it

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:26,180
so the purpose is very important because

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,410
the GDP are on top of what has been

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,930
existing so far says that the

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,329
documentation of of the data is very

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,129
important the documentation of the of

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:38,819
the purpose of the collection of the

00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:42,990
data so if you don't have a purpose for

00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:44,670
having that data don't don't ask for it

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,100
not only that you have to have a purpose

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,379
but you have to have you have to be

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,470
aware and document how long you're going

00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:56,490
to keep the data so you cannot have it

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,290
indefinitely if you've fulfilled your

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,569
purpose the one that you've already been

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,759
stating in your documentation you have

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,189
to delete it there is there is there are

00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,689
a few cases few exceptional cases where

00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:09,119
you can actually keep the data for

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:13,829
longer pass the moment of your specified

00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:15,749
purpose if we stay with the registration

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:21,449
form right let's say you you're within

00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:23,220
your purpose timeline but you've gotten

00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:25,170
a call from the person and the person

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,089
has asked what kind of data do you have

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,259
on me this is the kind of right that the

00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:33,899
person has you have to be able to answer

00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:37,139
within a specified time line if I'm not

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,850
mistaken 72 hours if for some reason

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:44,240
you're running such a huge database that

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:47,490
you you are not able to process this

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,970
this request within the 72 hours you can

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,689
get a I don't know another 48 I'm not

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,129
sure and that's about it so it depends

00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:57,839
on what kind of database you're running

00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:59,759
but this is where you get to another

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,709
point I would say this is a back-end

00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,179
issue you have to have the technical

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:07,920
means to process such requests within

00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:10,350
the required time line if you don't have

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,509
the technical means you have to let's

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,480
say get them you have to put them into

00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:19,529
place

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,629
so oh my database does not allow for

00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,819
such quick processing of such requests

00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:25,920
that's that doesn't fly so that doesn't

00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:29,369
work I don't know if it worked until now

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,430
but it definitely doesn't work starting

00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:35,829
with the 25th of May

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,600
right so a person asked for the data

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,639
let's say that's a simple case what if

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,639
they want to transfer their data

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,190
whatever it is that you've been storing

00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,769
so we go let's go on to mobile apps and

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,470
let's think that you have you have some

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,630
users and one of them is calling you and

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,970
says look I want to have my data from

00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:00,880
you everything that you've been storing

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:03,970
and I want to download it from you and

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,300
move it over to this other provider of

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,250
the same service let's say you have to

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:15,699
be able to do that so if you think in

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:17,889
terms of CSV is JSON XML this is the

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,779
kind of medium that you're going to have

00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:22,750
to provide to be able to provide so that

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:27,940
they can actually port their data to

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:30,730
another system and then what else do we

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,250
have so the data Portability deletion

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,199
that's a big one because deletion I mean

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,329
it affects everything right I've got

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:43,509
backups here the user calls you you tell

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:47,170
him we have your address your phone

00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:52,360
number and let's say your your your

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:54,850
surfing habits right he says deleted

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,880
please not only are you gonna have to

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:02,680
have a process in place in order to to

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,980
perform this this data destruction

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,509
properly you're going to have to dock

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,889
you to be able to be able to document

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:14,230
that you're gonna have to be able to

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:17,220
prove this - - to whatever inspection

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:22,120
comes your way but you're gonna have to

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,709
deal with your backups so again I'm

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,000
gonna ask a question if nobody comes up

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,980
with a quick answer I'm gonna move on

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,990
but who can think of a way to properly

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,329
destroy data including that the backups

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,399
because yes this is necessary so backups

00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:40,050
are not excluded when the person says I

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,050
want you to delete all of my date

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,750
alright I'm gonna assume that nobody's

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,540
in charge of the decision-making of this

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,070
of the infrastructure and because

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,800
otherwise I imagine you would have

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,180
concrete examples of what I'm asking

00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,010
right now

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,320
one example that I found online then

00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,840
because I definitely don't have any any

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,030
I mean IIIi am in charge of the backups

00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,310
with my company but but only marginally

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,190
one example that I found is that you

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,430
could have encryption if I understood

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,770
correctly you could have an encryption

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:21,590
key first of all when you delete the

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:26,390
data you you should keep the ID of

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:29,160
whatever it is that user had on on them

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,410
on a separate file right you have you've

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,760
deleted 100 users you should keep their

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:39,540
ID and you should also be encrypt it and

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:42,570
the moment that that they want their

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,430
data deleted you should you should know

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:52,260
hold on I'm getting confused now I just

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:54,720
realized the idea sorry but but an

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,380
anonymized record because otherwise you

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,300
you haven't been yes just the ID I

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,750
realize now that the example was

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,270
concrete was correct but for the wrong

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,010
thing so the reason you keep the list of

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,890
ID's is because when you restore from

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,580
backup you're gonna have to read elite

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:17,520
that users data in case you haven't gone

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,650
into your backup and deleted when he

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,660
required when they requested it it's

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,290
it's it's a very much a great territory

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,850
there because so theoretically you it's

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,010
very difficult to delete from your

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:33,120
backup right to go and delete from your

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:35,700
backup everything is possible but

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,250
technically and then time wise it's it's

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,780
it's quite difficult right so one

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,460
possibility is you don't delete from

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,860
your backup but you've you're keeping

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,050
this list of IDs and the moment you

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,730
restore them from your backup so that

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,010
you don't run into the trouble of oh

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,170
I've got the data again which I have

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,650
away which I was supposed to have delete

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,080
it you use the ID and Yury delete the

00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,260
data which is you know related to that

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,570
ID and there was another concept about

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:07,020
encrypting and then basically deleting

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:10,620
the encryption key I'm sure you can do

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:14,070
more with that than I do what else do we

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:18,390
have device theft right so I don't know

00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:20,939
if this this this is a direct influence

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,970
on on somebody who only it works on the

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,790
on the on the software side of things

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,560
but this is this is a serious data

00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,900
breach right because the device theft

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,570
means you're gonna get access to a

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,190
database you're gonna get access to some

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,620
systems you're gonna get access to a

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:44,220
hard drive even forgetting about you

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:46,430
know VPNs or whatever if we're talking

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,840
about device theft we're talking about

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,240
encryption right so I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,660
skip over to keep concepts data

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,890
encryption for everything if as much as

00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,850
possible right

00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:02,580
because if it's encrypted the moment you

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,140
you you present a data breach because

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,870
this is how it's gonna supposed to

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:11,100
happen after after gdpr is in place is

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,570
in play can I saw did you I thought I

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:28,070
saw you looking at the time how much

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:30,170
time do I have I have no idea okay right

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,249
so

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,249
[Music]

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:44,160
where was I encryption right if you have

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,700
stuff encrypted you the moment you have

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,000
to use the moment you report your breach

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:54,360
you are let's say in a in a much better

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,610
position then if you had no encryption

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,470
on whatever device you were working with

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,090
whatever databases you were programming

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,360
setting up and so on and so forth

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,920
because if you say there is encryption

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,190
even though they have access to the hard

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,680
drive it's more difficult or impossible

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:15,060
to actually get to the data that was

00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,860
stored on it I'm gonna I'm just going to

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,020
go back because this idea of mass

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,740
monitoring I think is important

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:26,880
mass monitoring the simplest example is

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,860
a like a time logger when you come to

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,840
work right that's that's a form of

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,360
employee monitoring because let's not

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,200
forget the I would say the most

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,210
important private data that you you are

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,880
gonna handle is gonna be your own right

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,190
we we immediately think of that those

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,010
other people that we gather data on but

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,560
actually your own is gonna be equally

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,690
important if not more important so when

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,300
you go to work you're being monitored in

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,210
in theory any form of mass monitoring if

00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:01,170
there's any kind of camera at work in

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,720
any any any corner that's going to

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,280
require starting now with the GPR it's

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,750
gonna require a form of risk assessment

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,600
and only based on that is it gonna be

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,310
possible to move on with with with this

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,410
form of mass monitoring and then moving

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:20,430
on to profiling this is super sensitive

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,740
profiling is basically any form of

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,650
automated decision-making any form of

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,130
automated data processing and then

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:32,310
decision-making so if there's no person

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:34,710
literally standing between the the

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,600
information and the decision based stop

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:41,640
based on that information then you have

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:45,890
a form of profiling it's it's a whole

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,890
different problem basically

00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:52,519
ideally you should you should you people

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,759
should should should shy away from that

00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:57,950
I had a I had a thought in mind and

00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,080
maybe maybe Daniel actually can help

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,869
because I know that he his specialty is

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,379
law but let's say the most basic example

00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:10,340
of what I would understand as profiling

00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:12,830
you have a form where based on let's say

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,809
age you filter people out right so that

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:18,200
when they've tried to register as users

00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:21,409
you filter everybody under 16 years old

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,950
right but you're gonna do that in code

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:27,649
right there's no person saying he's 15

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:31,220
but based on whatever else I'm gonna let

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:33,259
him through so do what are your thoughts

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:52,460
on that hot is that a form of profiling

00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:54,080
is that I also thought that it is but

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,609
since it was my own example which I

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,580
could give myself with the little coat

00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:01,369
that I know I thought maybe maybe that's

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,080
not a form of profiling but so you take

00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:05,330
from there and you go up to machine

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,850
learning which is like definitely

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,639
profiling let's say if you if you use

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,659
any kind of private data to to to feed

00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:16,369
and and teach a machine trainer machine

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:20,289
yeah you you have a whole bunch of

00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:24,679
things to think about and to to treat

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:28,340
accordingly right key concepts obviously

00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,139
the consent is is very important so if

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,009
you think of the simplest examples in

00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:37,850
terms of like people accepting your

00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:42,230
cookies it has to be as far as I

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:45,559
understood it has to be an active it has

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,480
to be active so if it says if you

00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,549
continue within the next five seconds

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,619
with I'm just making this up with

00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:53,570
surfing our webpage this for us means

00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:56,039
you've accepted our privacy policy that

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:58,739
is a no-go so it has to be an act

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,940
of opt-in right so octane instead of

00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:05,580
opt-out for for for me for newsletters

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,729
right up until now there were definitely

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,769
many cases where the opti the the the

00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:12,539
check box was already ticked you're not

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:14,279
allowed to have that anymore absolutely

00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,499
not it has to be a positive affirmative

00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:20,820
affirmative action in order for the

00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:22,950
person to agree to be part of whatever

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,509
it is that you're gonna process their

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:30,029
data for right consent should be

00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:31,470
withdrawal from the users page I'm sure

00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,840
everybody can think of at least one

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,359
example of some webpage where you could

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,409
not find how you can delete your users

00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:42,269
like your your profile that's again

00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:42,929
that's against the law maybe it was

00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:45,629
until now

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:49,710
probably it was but definitely this has

00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:53,779
been specified right now data protection

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:57,179
by design right before you even start

00:23:53,779 --> 00:24:00,059
right coding in your in our case in your

00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:03,269
case you're going to have to think about

00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:07,859
the entire flow of data and you're going

00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:10,979
to have to plan for it so logging of

00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:17,539
personal data that's that's in principle

00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:20,970
a bad idea if if you do have logs

00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:24,389
including personal data the GDP are

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,070
states that if it is provable that is it

00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:29,399
is in your company's interest to keep

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,139
those logs you can do it but you're

00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:35,879
going to have to have a very good reason

00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:38,099
for it data minimization this is also a

00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:40,379
key concept right do not ask for

00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,789
anything that you do not need to have if

00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,950
you have a form if you have a

00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:48,840
registration form and you're gonna ask

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,669
for their income if you're gonna even in

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,070
you know bracket it if you're gonna ask

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:57,989
for any kind of superfluous information

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,669
better not and this goes back to the DP

00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:01,799
by design right think in the beginning

00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,509
what do you truly need because you have

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,039
to think about how long you're gonna

00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:07,320
keep it you're gonna have to think about

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,910
your your goal and so on and so forth

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,560
and all of this if you get an inspection

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,810
you're going to have to present with the

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:19,060
appropriate documentation with the

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:22,510
appropriate processes in place pseudonym

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:25,030
ization this is the best way or one of

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,440
the easiest way best I'm not sure if

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,970
it's easiest but it's definitely one of

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,770
the best ways to ensure that you have as

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,710
little headache with the gdpr as

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:39,430
possible right if you have if there's no

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,770
possibility of identifying a person with

00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,750
whatever data you've stored then you're

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,130
in the green you don't even you don't

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,870
even need to worry about the

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,560
documentation right and about the whole

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,480
process it's probably easier said than

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,170
done but it's it's definitely something

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,170
to keep in mind

00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,990
transparency I've put this in because

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,110
the easier it is basically for the

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,490
end-user to get to know what it is that

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,530
you're storing on them what it is that

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,690
you're processing and what you're doing

00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,100
basically with their information the

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,250
better it is right the more transparent

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:18,040
you are data encryption for everything

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,710
opt in instead of opt outs and H checks

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,660
for children under the country's legal

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,240
age if I'm not mistaken in Austria it's

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:31,450
like the full ended fully ended

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:34,810
fourteenth year of age you're gonna need

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,630
adult permission to gather that their

00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,610
data right so think about you you're not

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,260
you're not screening them you're right

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:46,710
you're not screening the kids in your

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:49,930
registration form but if they are under

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:53,230
15 years of age right how do you get

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:55,390
this adult right adult permission

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,450
parents actually adult discs is wrong

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,850
it's the parents permission and I was

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,770
reading online there was a funny example

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:07,600
of you're gonna have to have a selfie

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:11,800
with the parent because if one thing was

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,660
I think one example was the email from

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,490
the parent of the parent should should

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,530
send an email you know with their

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,830
consent but of course the kid can easily

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,910
create an email address and and and fake

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,870
the

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:27,430
parents permission so stuff like selfie

00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,830
with the parent and so and so and so

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:33,120
forth there are areas where the GDP are

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:37,060
is is is rather vague so that's why

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,950
people are thinking about how to how to

00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,590
get this done

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:44,860
right sources maybe this is the wrong

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:47,530
order so the official website of the GDP

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:52,120
are would be this one they have like

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:55,150
bullet points on on what has what is

00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:00,430
different what has changed I would say

00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:03,310
very very useful is the privacy officers

00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:06,960
because this is a fine if I'm not

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:11,560
mistaken it's the word for for I'm a

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:15,760
nonprofit organization right which which

00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:19,930
is but is is is made up of counselors

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,090
people working in law and they provide

00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:25,030
there's a forum so they provide answers

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,130
to questions and I think they also

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,050
prepare forms and and you know

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,690
checklists and the steps that are needed

00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:35,560
to become compliant and then there is

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:39,670
the dot in cockpit and this is a website

00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:42,370
which has been put together because

00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,950
there is for every big company this I

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,990
would say influences you less unless

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,540
you're in charge of creating this which

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:52,590
could also be every company is supposed

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,770
to have a so called register the fatalis

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:59,140
so far it there there was a central

00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,910
register where or the all the data had

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,360
to flow in terms of this privacy

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:06,730
information that the company stored now

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,470
it's it's no longer centralized it goes

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,120
into the responsibility of all the

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,930
companies of each company individually

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,210
and so now most of the companies all the

00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,920
way down to the self-employed people

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:21,280
they're gonna have to have this kind of

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,110
register which documents what do they do

00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,090
when somebody asks them what kind of

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,730
data you have on me or what do you do

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,560
what do i do as a company when somebody

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,900
asked me to delete their data or what do

00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,300
i do when they ask me I want to port my

00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,940
data to Facebook give me whatever you

00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,129
have on me

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,039
so all this documentation with all the

00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:41,599
all the you know the the reasons why you

00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,580
store everything and everything that

00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:48,619
we've been talking about all of this has

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:50,869
to be in one big file database in

00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:53,720
principle is recommended and they Dalton

00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:58,190
cockpit is trying to offer like you know

00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:01,369
a solution for that a pre pre like a

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:03,859
ready-made solution for that they're not

00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:05,419
they're not really yet fully operational

00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,210
but I think they will be they said

00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:09,169
beginning of April so I'm expecting

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,409
anytime now

00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:15,289
right yeah I'm done thank you for your

00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:18,529
attention I hope I did not absolutely

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:19,380
kill them who here and yeah any

00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,099
questions

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,099
