	Talk by Vlad J. D. Aleon

Learning to code does not have to end with a software developer position. There are many employment situations where coding skills or at least an understanding of the software development process brings great benefits. One such example is Vlad's story. It illustrates the evolution from Business Analyst to what could be described as "IT Product Manager", a person connecting decision makers and software developers in order to communicate requirements & limitations, thus ensuring the optimal outcome at the intersection of the two. In Vlad's case, the outcome is named Colossus, a custom-built business intelligence solution build in Oracle Apex.
