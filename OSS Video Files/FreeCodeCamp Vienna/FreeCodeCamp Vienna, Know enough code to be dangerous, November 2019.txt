Title: FreeCodeCamp Vienna, Know enough code to be dangerous, November 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-06

Description: 
	Talk by Vlad J. D. Aleon

Learning to code does not have to end with a software developer position. There are many employment situations where coding skills or at least an understanding of the software development process brings great benefits. One such example is Vlad's story. It illustrates the evolution from Business Analyst to what could be described as "IT Product Manager", a person connecting decision makers and software developers in order to communicate requirements & limitations, thus ensuring the optimal outcome at the intersection of the two. In Vlad's case, the outcome is named Colossus, a custom-built business intelligence solution build in Oracle Apex.

I don't know if any of you know but for

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,510
example Rob and Daniel the ones who

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:12,179
started free code camp Vienna have both

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,580
had very nice and very interesting

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,220
success stories so they if I'm not

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,779
mistaken I hope this is this is not

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,150
something wrong I'm saying but I think

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,609
both of them got their first job as

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,039
programmers with free code camp

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,410
curriculum on there let's say resume as

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,239
a programmer and not much else in terms

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,820
of coding or background and I've been

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,290
I've been following free code camp since

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,600
January 2018 and one of the reasons why

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,320
I have is because that's when I became

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,230
seriously interested in programming my

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,620
background is very mixed I've worked

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:58,020
both as a translator and as in as an

00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,600
economist and however it's it has always

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,820
been I've always had a passion for for

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,369
computers this started when I was a kid

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,040
you know computers had just come out and

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,990
I desperately wanted a computer my first

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,080
computer was 386 and I remember even now

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,990
that I had I wanted my parents to get me

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,790
a 486 and they got me the 386 and I

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,200
cried and cried it was the end of the

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,330
world for me because I had such plans

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,729
for that computer and then they got me

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,090
the lesser one anyway that's where he

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,000
started it was a intense moment and ever

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,820
since then you know again it's it has

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,130
always been a part of my life so

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,579
wherever wherever I went one way or

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,060
another

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,700
I was may be entrusted with some some

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,340
more techie stuff I was the Excel guy in

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,790
the company or I was the person who

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,090
could you know troubleshoot some kind of

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,420
a hardware problem which which went

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,790
beyond a restart and so my interest

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,780
along with these little elements you

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,860
know they they grew in

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:08,050
into a little bit of knowledge and they

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,720
kind of brought me to to write the

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,690
beginning of 2018 when I decided okay I

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,490
know some hardware I know some opera I

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,910
understand operating systems but

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,680
honestly I would like to understand this

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,330
this programming thing what's what's

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,600
this about because this seems like where

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,610
the magic is at right there and okay I

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,250
said I'm gonna start researching I'm

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,830
gonna learn how to program I didn't know

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,650
what I'm gonna start with so after I'm

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,390
sure a lot of people know who are maybe

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,790
just starting or have started at some

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,440
point we from scratch that research

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,600
process of what my first programming

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,720
language is gonna be that can be really

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,630
draining that can be very intense

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,840
after this intense process I've actually

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,090
decided on JavaScript and you know I

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,900
started with free code camp I started

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,070
going through the curriculum and

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,010
immediately I started getting more and

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,200
more involved with activities activities

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,530
such as meetups such as the free code

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,180
camp meetups but other ones as well I

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,340
started going to hackathons almost

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,239
immediately so I knew absolutely nothing

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,829
and yet I was I was at I was at the

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,480
hackathon in about two months after

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:25,230
starting to learn to program and had an

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,090
incredible amount of fun and I

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,170
understood that it's it's you know it it

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,709
actually programming has a place in

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,930
everybody's life let's say and that

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,940
place can be very different from person

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,190
to person and that's what the first part

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,560
of this talk is about the fact that not

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,390
every journey that you know involves

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,850
learning to program has to end in a

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,860
programming a software developer

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,420
position because this is how I started I

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,160
thought I'm gonna learn to program in

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,440
most probably at some point I'm gonna

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm gonna end up a software developer

00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,980
but I'm here to tell you that that

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,310
that's not the case something completely

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,260
different happened so after being

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,850
involved in all of these events and

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,489
hackathons I started slowly

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,919
understanding where coding fits into my

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,480
life because I am currently working as a

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,540
business analyst for a medical device

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,959
manufacturer

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,030
and let's say to some degree I was I was

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,639
a little bored because you know I had

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,979
these sales report to generate I was

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,050
working with a lot of Excel but you know

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:29,830
after you get you figure out the ins and

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,949
outs to some degree it starts becoming

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:37,090
routine some elements become a routine

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:41,030
so for me adding this coding element

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,310
into my knowledge pool provided an

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:49,490
opportunity and I used it basically to

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:51,169
spice up my my yeah my daily job when I

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,970
say my daily job so like I said I'm a

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,039
business analyst but I I'm a bit of a

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,289
jack-of-all-trades so I have to do some

00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,530
sales reporting I have to do some iit

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:05,380
stuff and I also have to take care of

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:09,860
data protection ever since May 2018 and

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:13,639
at so in in the summer of last year I

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,139
discovered I discovered wait sorry no in

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,229
the summer of this year I I went to

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,560
Africa cam it up and somebody presented

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,320
Oracle apex and for those who are not

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,520
familiar with Oracle apex this is a

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:32,030
framework a low code framework that's

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,550
developed by Oracle and they provided

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:38,780
for free provide as long as you're using

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,520
an Oracle database the good thing is

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,950
that you don't need a licensed Oracle

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,139
database you can also use the Community

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,510
Edition of the of the Oracle database

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,610
and since I was doing a lot of business

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,340
intelligence in Excel and I had for

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,190
example to shuffle a lot of Excel files

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,260
and because we have a Salesforce which

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,210
you know every person where every person

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,639
is responsible for one particular area

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,560
and I had to divide those sales to

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,110
different people and it was always to

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,250
some degree manual and it was a lot of

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,250
data cleaning and a lot of

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,939
not so fun work including always the

00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:17,009
possibility that I'm sending the wrong

00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:19,080
excel file to the wrong person and

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,120
therefore creating a little bit of an in

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,449
of an incident I thought you know what

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,250
I'm gonna use my programming knowledge

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,949
well first of all I was really excited

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,849
about this framework because I thought

00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:34,650
this is a very good system for me like I

00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:37,289
said I discovered that programming had a

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,270
place in my life and it wasn't that of

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,930
the software developer I had no time for

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,300
that at work so I thought how can I use

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,819
it I needed a little bit of a structure

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,909
and Oracle apex provided that structure

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,250
Oracle apex is like I said a local low

00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:57,060
code framework which takes care of a lot

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,849
of basics those who are software

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,009
developers know that frameworks this is

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:05,419
to some degree what frameworks do right

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:09,210
frameworks take away the the things that

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,770
pretty much every software development

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,409
project needs let's say things like

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,710
security or I don't know things like

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:19,500
templating boilerplates formatting and

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,750
Oracle apex does all of that the

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,210
paradigm is that you have a database in

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,089
the back and in the front you have a web

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,050
application which communicates with with

00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:33,659
that database and some software

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,060
developers would say okay but that's

00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:38,400
that's very limited I can program all of

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,409
that from scratch and I have totally

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,819
respect for that but I also know how

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:47,430
long that takes and and also yeah some

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,889
people don't necessarily have the luxury

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,779
to do to do that to to to to some degree

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,860
reinvent the wheel from scratch but also

00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,900
put their own mark on it so for me this

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,750
was the way to go I couldn't program

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,289
from scratch anything so I chose apex

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,969
and another really cool thing that I'm

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,039
gonna talk about and I'm now going to

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:12,419
show is the fact that Oracle just

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,400
announced that this this local framework

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,180
is now available in their autonomous

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,259
cloud when I when I implemented this

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,370
this was like I said end of summer 2019

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,340
this

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,960
did not exist which meant a lot of a bit

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,880
of a painful process of setting

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,699
everything up because I took the Oracle

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,620
Community Edition database and then the

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,330
Oracle apex and then everything else did

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,250
there's a wrapper on top of that and had

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,159
to make it work that was that was quite

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,110
painful right now if somebody wants to

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,130
do the same thing they don't have to do

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,589
any of that so what happens is that

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,860
Oracle has released this autonomous

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:54,230
database and they have a free tier where

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,540
they offer a limit to the amount of

00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,980
resources and based on that one can

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,839
create a licensed database and on top of

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,640
that they can use Oracle apex so I'm

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,470
gonna try to run you through the process

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,589
of creating a database like that on the

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,810
on the on the cloud from Oracle so let's

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:19,250
assume you do have already the account

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:21,500
if you create a data warehouse you need

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,750
to you need to choose display name

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,320
database name basic things one of the

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,110
main decisions is what kind of a

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,070
workload are you gonna be having data

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,990
warehouse is more for data analytics

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,600
kind of work workload and the

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,459
transaction processing is like I said

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,380
for this paradigm of having a front-end

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,209
which communicates with with the backend

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,660
so we're going to choose the transaction

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:50,120
processing for this for this situation

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,709
then we're going to go with server lists

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,410
we don't have our own dedicated

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,990
infrastructure we're going to use what

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,270
Oracle has to offer we're gonna have the

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,980
always free elements therefore you never

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:06,050
have to worry that at some point you

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,520
might start to incur costs and you can

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,260
see here the limitations right you have

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:16,279
one one CPU and about 20 gigs of storage

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:20,510
don't think that this is slow one CPU in

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:23,600
the in this Exadata infrastructure which

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,670
Oracle provides this is is it too small

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I see some people squinting sorry let me

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:32,050
try to let me try to increase the size

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,050
of this

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:41,290
no okay me and my there we go

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:44,890
so yeah this EXO that the infrastructure

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,529
from Oracle is is serious business so

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,769
one one CPU there is gonna is going to

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,480
provide you with a very fast back-end

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:55,600
for four basic needs and even even

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,029
beyond basic needs hopefully you don't

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,829
need so much story storage more than the

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,350
twenty gigs but since it's a database

00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:06,390
and it's very optimized I think a lot of

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:12,040
people can make do with that right and

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:14,860
then we can actually create a database

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,480
we can provide a password we can you

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,269
know we can say that we want to light

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,010
the included license and then we can

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,180
just create the database now I'm not

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,800
going to do this because this takes a

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,459
little bit of time what happens once you

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,709
click create is that the debate the

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,029
database starts being provisioned and it

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,589
takes let's say about five to ten

00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,240
minutes and as soon as that happens you

00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:37,660
can access it and so now I'm going to

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,630
show you what this looks like with one

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:47,140
that I've already created so right here

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:48,820
I have this database and you can see

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,950
that it was created for this kind of

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,470
work workload transaction processing

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,850
that storage is 20 gigs one CPU so

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,899
everything is the free on the free level

00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,520
now if you go to the service console

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,070
you're going to be presented with some

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,070
statistics but most importantly there is

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,670
this button for development now on the

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,649
development you get these frameworks

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,570
such as the Oracle apex which sits on

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,290
top of the database some of you might be

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,390
familiar with the sequel developer which

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,570
is normally something that one has to

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,670
install locally here it's also provided

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,660
in the cloud but let's go ahead and open

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,790
Oracle apex we're presented with a with

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,519
a logging screen I think I'm already

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,870
logged in yeah so once you log once you

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,930
log in here you're you're you're

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:41,199
presented with the Oracle apex window

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,839
and first I'm going to show you kind of

00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,390
what's what's possible let's say so if

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,180
we go to create

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:51,650
week okay if we go to create we have to

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,650
login again

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,790
right if we create a new application we

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,440
can start from scratch we can start from

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,600
a file which contains the data that

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,590
we're going to be processing or we can

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
choose one of their so-called

00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,830
productivity app apps which which is

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,380
basically a template a ready-made

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,730
application and I've already installed

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,990
the decision manager let's just go

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,610
through the installation process just so

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,350
you see how quick and easy it works

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,190
easily I'm gonna go with the team

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:38,920
productivity group calendar I'm gonna

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:41,170
click install app and yeah we're gonna

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,150
wait for a few minutes and then as soon

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,380
as we have this we're gonna as soon as

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,390
this is installed we're gonna have a

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:51,010
fully functioning cloud-based web

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,450
application with them with a licensed

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,830
Oracle database in the background which

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,190
brings you all of the performance

00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,780
benefits it brings you it's it's an HTTP

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:03,790
connection not only that every time that

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,440
there is a new database and there is a

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,810
new version of Apex

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,490
it's immediately upgraded this this for

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,760
me for example was was a bit of a

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,410
problem I thought I was gonna have to go

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,560
through the same painful process as I

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,390
did initially when I installed the

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,580
Oracle apex and the database at my work

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,990
place that I'm gonna have to do that all

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,090
over again once there's a new version

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,750
all of that is gone in the cloud because

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,310
Oracle simply updates it for you right

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,250
so we've installed the group calendar

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,540
let's see what this looks like in the

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,770
beginning when we're presented with a

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,150
kind of a small Settings menu

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,730
let's say we're going to give everybody

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,080
reader access here we can add some new

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,000
users we're not going to do that right

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,010
now we are getting the option of having

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,560
some sample data loaded we're going to

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,350
do that so that we can play around with

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:58,350
it and a couple of features let's just

00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:00,730
complete the set up and there it is now

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,560
the link right now looks kinda scary

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,350
it's huge and and very difficult to

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,290
remember if we were to shorten this it

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,470
would be much more accessible and we

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,350
could for example benefit from an

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,720
another

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,110
another thing that Oracle offers is the

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,339
fact that this entire framework is

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,980
perfectly ready to run on a mobile

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:27,850
device no matter what the mobile devices

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,430
be it of a cell phone or a tablet it's

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,980
immediately scalable and the whole thing

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,750
just works out of the box so let's see

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,250
what we've just installed we have a

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,260
group calendar we can see the calendar

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,240
it even has like I said some sample data

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,790
let's look at this weekly sales update

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,860
what is this we have a lot of time when

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,510
the meeting takes place what's it about

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,800
who created it

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,900
are there any attachments are there any

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,190
updates there's even I think yeah

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,800
there's a basically a kind of a

00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:04,029
communication option where you can say

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:05,950
hey I'll be late right and and then one

00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,529
creates this and then it's it's it's

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,950
like a small forum right where it's very

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:14,260
similar to the meetup functionality I

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,460
don't know if you know currently free

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,279
code camp is trying to get away from

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,670
meetup calm because they kind of pull

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,470
the weird stunt where they tried or at

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,060
least there was some rumor that they

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,640
would start charging for the meetups

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,050
which is when free code camp said okay

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,410
none of this we're going to create our

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:34,600
own but for example if you have your if

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,570
you have a need for creating your own

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,640
kind of meta P system framework you

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,730
could directly use this so this would be

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,529
you could add new users you could you

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,570
know add events let's having a new event

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:50,170
and look and see what this looks like so

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:52,540
we're gonna say free code camp 42

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,070
because it's a good number and we're

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,050
gonna choose a different one specific

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,370
calendar what kind of a meetup it is

00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,830
when does it start

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,959
etc etc etc who's the contact person

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,120
maybe some links in order for the people

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,829
to see what are the presentations going

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,949
to be and then we just create the event

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:12,010
let's actually choose a date let's

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:15,819
create the event for tomorrow at 12:00

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:18,100
and let's create it immediately it shows

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,319
up in here and all of the users have

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,650
access they can start adding details

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,990
comments files etc etc you can have a

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,770
different view for example a timeline

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,660
style view

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,820
instead of the calendar view one can

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,470
search let's have a look at free code

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,380
camp let's see where it is immediately

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,470
you find it searches all of the all of

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,000
the columns instantly and so we find the

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,620
meetup that we've just created you can

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,670
see things are color-coded based on

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,230
event type so you have a lot of

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,380
functionality this is it's just given to

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,760
you and you you need to work with it you

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,520
can have some administration there's a

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,320
lot of you know you can look at which

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,300
users are using it who is the most

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,620
intense user what are the notifications

00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,900
reporting you can send emails to all of

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,470
the users so literally this is meetup

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,179
comm from Oracle if you wanted to you

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,160
can start adding your own functionality

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,570
I'm not gonna I'm not actually going to

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,450
mess with this but I'm gonna show you

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:22,750
one last thing here so let's say I don't

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:24,400
use the inbuilt applications I'm going

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,429
to create an application from scratch

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,750
and I'm gonna say new application we're

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:33,040
gonna give it a name so it's gonna be

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:35,050
free code camp 42 Boop's 42 you can

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,520
choose the formatting here a lot of

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,080
details we're gonna skip through all of

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,460
that it's gonna create the application

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,290
ok and here we have it we have a global

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,940
page a home page and a login plate page

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:53,940
this is the base these are the basics if

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:53,940
I run it and I logged in we're gonna see

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,700
those three pages well we're gonna see

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,840
that okay I'm gonna have to do this

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,840
without talking one second

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,150
there we go so we have a homepage the

00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:21,950
functionality is there again immediately

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,900
accessible from a mobile device let us

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,370
actually create something so we're going

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,270
to go to the home page which is the one

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,940
we were looking at and why is it called

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:34,130
the low code because you can see that a

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,440
lot of elements are already provided and

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:40,159
you don't have to worry about for

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:44,210
example security or a lot of you know

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,610
paradigms that come with a software

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,870
development project this is a little bit

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:53,270
similar to your window page the document

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,950
from HTML and we're going to have

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:59,090
regions and within within this region

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,950
within this category we're going to

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:07,720
create a new region and within this

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:10,220
region we're gonna create a chart

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,809
immediately they ask us ok what what do

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,870
you want to display in this chart so

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:19,159
let's choose a source in this case you

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,140
can choose a sequel query or a PL sequel

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,970
query or a table let's take one of the

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,510
tables that's provided by it to us by

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:30,409
default

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:33,760
let's take hmm let's take something

00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:36,230
that's potentially hopefully relevant

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,990
decision nodes let's take decision

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,360
projects let's see what this is about so

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,860
it's telling us what exactly it's

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,659
expecting here and the under these

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,200
messages so it's saying that it wants a

00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,580
mapping for the label the map for the

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,950
label it's gonna be the project name in

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,929
this case and it wants to agra agra gate

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,820
a value you can see that it already

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,309
tells you in this table that you've

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,440
chosen there are some data types which

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,840
are just wrong for the for aggregation

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,289
so don't even bother choosing that so

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:09,740
what I'm gonna try to use it's not ideal

00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:11,149
but I'm gonna take created and let's see

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,010
if this looks like anything I'm gonna

00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:19,210
run it yeah no this was not a good

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:22,720
choice it's saying no data to display

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,720
let's see

00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:30,169
let me try something else

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:35,419
I did not plan on which chart I should

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:37,549
use and that was a mistake okay I'll

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:44,750
make it simpler I'll take an interactive

00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:47,120
grid it's not giving me an interactive

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,429
come on there we go yeah an interactive

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,370
report rather and we're just gonna take

00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:53,419
the same table if I can find it the

00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,409
project yes

00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:58,539
let's run this it wants something from

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:03,950
me

00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:15,620
table name didn't I already tell you

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:16,100
this project let's see oh okay this is

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,070
painful

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:26,179
okay there all right

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:32,230
long story short low code is not as low

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:40,669
as you might imagine I'd even lost the

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:42,710
I've actually lost the page so I'm not

00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:46,940
sure where I lost the page there are

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,830
lost page yeah low code means still that

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,690
you have to get used to the framework no

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,200
doubt just like with any framework but

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:58,940
this in my opinion in my experience is

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:01,190
far easier to get you know used to for

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,169
me it was like this because you know

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,080
you're not presented with that blank

00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:09,140
page in the IDE and you're like go on

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,350
create write some code and many of us

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,240
maybe I would I daresay many of us go ok

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,559
Stack Overflow I'm gonna copy paste some

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,679
stuff and I'm gonna hack something

00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,679
together right so all of that goes away

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:28,610
to wrap this up because I'm out of time

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,070
yeah my my journey to with learning to

00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,690
code began with the thought of I'm gonna

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,059
learn to code and I'm gonna end up with

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,399
to a developer absolutely not the case I

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,169
am I do not have the time at work to

00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:40,669
work as I could change my job but I

00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,950
really love it and I love the team and

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,269
so on and so forth but I I wanted to

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,849
still make use of it so then I

00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:49,609
introduced it in a different way and

00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:52,279
that different way is by making use for

00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:56,389
example of a framework and I can also

00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:58,789
tell you that I'm not I'm old I'm only

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:01,249
taking care of this system at work on a

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:02,720
superficial level because I've hired a

00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:05,419
programmer it was actually the person

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,840
who presented the framework during the

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:11,869
three coke Amitabh and I realize just

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:15,379
how important it is to be able to talk

00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:17,840
to a programmer it might sound silly but

00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:19,849
actually without understanding some

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,679
programming if I'm just the manager who

00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:24,879
or somebody doesn't have to be manager

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:29,499
just anybody who's trying to you know

00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:33,649
transmit I need I need you to create

00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:35,539
meetup comm for me you know with as

00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:38,539
little resources as possible and as

00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:39,769
quick a time as possible so the capacity

00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:41,899
to transmit that is actually very

00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:44,419
important and I would not have been able

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:48,169
to do it without going through my

00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:51,309
journey with coding and to some degree

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:54,890
free code camp really facilitated that

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:58,419
so that was a talk thank you very much

00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,419
