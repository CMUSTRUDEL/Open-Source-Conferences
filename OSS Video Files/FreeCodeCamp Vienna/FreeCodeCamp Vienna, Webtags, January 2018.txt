so hi everyone thanks for coming

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,150
my name is Mark Luke John a--which and I

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,410
would like to present today a project

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:18,199
that me and two colleagues together like

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,680
during December and it's called web tags

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:29,789
that as Mike web for Internet network

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:32,399
website and taxes graffiti first shortly

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:37,680
about us I first introduced myself

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,600
because I'm a bit new I think to like

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,370
develop that development or something I

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,559
started learning some fourteen months

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,930
ago when I discovered free code camp my

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,420
plan is to actually like do it on some

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,800
professional basis but I still think I

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,989
have a bit to learn and I have some

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,329
portfolio to finish so this is what I'm

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,510
working on right now and my background

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,680
is actually like film and video and

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:11,250
photography auto lash is the third of us

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:14,130
who is not here pronunciation is

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,540
I think 19 or 20 he finished high school

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,369
I think in the last year

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:24,930
now here's like a gap year and he

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:26,220
service service September and I think

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,270
he's also learning something around the

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,610
year and yeah I guess his plan is to

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,770
continue studying with some informatics

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,369
or computer science is called in English

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:44,850
and the third member is Andriy Sidorenko

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:47,850
who can say Bodeen okay he will

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:53,250
introduce himself when you know you'll

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:56,640
have this part of the presentation so

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,430
it's about us I was thinking maybe it'll

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,649
be very interesting shortly to say

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,770
something about how this VAT tax project

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,430
came about and

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:10,819
it started in November when Daniel and

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,530
Robert organized Meetup when it wasn't

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,030
actually about presentations but it was

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,080
about people coding together and

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,000
afterwards it was like my first

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,360
experience coding with some other people

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,760
and it was quite interesting in many

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,310
ways and afterwards I was talking with

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,590
Daniel about why there are no hackathons

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,260
really or at least as far as I can say

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,880
happening in Vienna there was one which

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,200
is supposed to be in autumn but then it

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,400
got canceled because there wasn't enough

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,010
people interested in that I guess and

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
then I was thinking on the way home

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,819
simply like that it would be really

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,319
great to do something right like that

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,269
like to code with some people or do some

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,209
acetone but I really don't know enough

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,910
people in Vienna to be able to organize

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,410
anything like this so I was thinking

00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,060
like how to make something similar

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,440
happen and I had the idea to maybe it

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,030
wouldn't have to be like a competition

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,519
between teams but it would be just like

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,590
one team that realizes some idea that we

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:12,049
kind of like decide on together and I

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,109
posted an announcement to Facebook group

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,030
of faculty and Vienna and a couple of

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,420
people answered to it and then we met

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:24,070
and it was originally four of us who met

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,390
and we just threw some ideas on the

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,130
table and we discussed them and

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,350
brainstormed a bit and then we came with

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:39,609
the idea for this thing that we call

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:41,840
that pipes now demo web text is

00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:44,810
something like an application or a

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,109
service I can say like now we only have

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,799
like a very simple basic working

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:54,650
prototype but it works and the idea is

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,350
that it's service let's say but it's

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,359
like a bit too strong word I think - it

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:04,250
allows you to post a message and leave

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:06,380
message on any web site and read

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,090
messages that your friends left there

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:14,650
and as you see this like green thing try

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,010
to do a demo this is like the interface

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,600
for leaving the message and

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,900
it works like the principle is that you

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,340
basically create the account with us

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,010
like this for us feel free just to your

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,930
email then you search for people find

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,540
some people become friends with them and

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,090
then you can leave those messages and

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:40,410
those friends of yours can access those

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:42,540
messages besides you and I will now post

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,130
one to show you just simply how it works

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,130
it's not know nothing

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,250
you think our server is sleeping so it

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,250
would probably take some time to wake up

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:23,390
yeah yeah you see like yeah this is like

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,550
it's it's we didn't do really any work

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,830
basically I would say on some like user

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,200
interface so dislike to create a message

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,210
and to like reduce messages like mingle

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,620
together so it's maybe confusing but

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:40,180
this is the message that I just posted

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,180
yeah this is how it works for example

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,660
[Music]

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,480
yeah it's simply like the point is that

00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,640
it reads the URL in your address bar and

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,230
save this in the database was with some

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,880
other information and only on that URL

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:20,560
you can see those messages yeah for

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:23,030
example I have like this one medium so I

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,060
would just like very briefly say like

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:29,360
what this project like technologically

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,910
consists of and then professor Andre

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:41,540
will take you through the guts of some

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:44,840
deeper layers of the project so

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:49,130
basically it's the JavaScript script

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,670
that gets like injected into into a page

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,740
and that renders like this interface and

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,810
all those messages like it makes

00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,350
requests to server and fetches all those

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,310
messages from our database and that's

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:08,630
great is injected into all those pages

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:11,740
using a browser extensions now we like

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,180
work with Chrome extension but

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,470
planets like eventually to do at least

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,360
also a Firefox version but I think it's

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,160
theoretically extendable also to like

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,080
all the all the major browsers that do

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,199
support this like classic classical

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,240
extensions API and of course like this

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,500
like front-end part communicates with

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,650
server which is no js' application and

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:44,260
we use database and in our case it's a

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:47,449
MongoDB database now I'm very welcome

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,449
[Music]

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,060
okay my name is Andre thank you for

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,570
giving us possibility to give this

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,540
presentation about our project so in

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,720
principle I joined the project as Marco

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,730
said in November when we discussed what

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,740
we are going to do and what how we are

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:23,580
going to apply our skills in programming

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,520
can teach our self how to do that

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,919
actually in programming I'm not new

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,950
because I started many years ago from

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,310
such old languages like Fortran and even

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,280
assembler so but then I didn't do for

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:44,040
many years because I worked in physics

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,720
and did many things there as an eye when

00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,580
such language like Python appears so I

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,220
started to work with bison because it

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:55,270
was very useful for my purposes and

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,860
physics very useful for plotting and for

00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,040
data analysis and so on

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,460
and recently I just started to think

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,950
about having fun with programming and I

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,440
found the JavaScript now is quite great

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,550
language and one can do many things and

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,510
I discovered it probably I need to do

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,950
something with that

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:21,430
and that time actually probably was in

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:25,110
September and fortunately Marco appeared

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:28,510
already quite soon so we met and started

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:34,890
our project okay as Marco already said

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:38,980
so this was considered as an application

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:41,830
to communicate between just at the

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:46,150
beginning it was considered like leaving

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:48,010
some messages on the website so but of

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,140
course it's not that exciting just to

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:54,100
leave a comment on the website for

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:57,480
yourself so and we decided just better

00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:02,700
if we are extending it and have these

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,700
messages or commands for groups for

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:10,650
available public

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,060
and also for friends and actually where

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,940
it can be applied why it can be

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:22,190
interesting so the first idea was just

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:25,320
we can leave the comments or say some

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,630
some ideas on website like a news

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,010
website and this website in principle

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,470
you can leave the comments there but

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,720
usually it's prayer or post moderated

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,930
websites and you need to register there

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,090
so you need and all these messages can

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,540
be only public so you cannot leave these

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:46,130
messages there for your friends only or

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,140
for some special groups so our web tech

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,480
application allows these all things to

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,390
do right for small communities or for

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,450
yourself or for just for friends to

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,630
leave these comments okay so as mark

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,080
already mentions this application

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:07,110
consists of a few layers as a first or

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,970
the top layer is a lightest layer which

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,920
is called extension and it's in

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,000
principle on the browser's browser site

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,900
and it's responsible for all these

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,650
operations with signing up and signing

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,800
in up and out and also the main purpose

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:29,850
of this extension is to load the client

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:36,240
script which is the next layer and the

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:38,610
client script is made for just a display

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,690
messages or say it's just a user

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:46,760
interface and and in principle the

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:49,260
clients client script is supposed to be

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,750
uploaded by the extension so as the

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,390
clients creep should be kept should be

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,100
stored on the server side so the next

00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,230
layer is a server script which is

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,600
responsible for sending and receiving

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,420
horses requests from the client script

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,410
and all these API s and middleware

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:16,610
points and also for communicating is a

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:19,510
database so it's just normal REST API

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,770
which like food

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:27,670
post and so on and it does it gives a

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:33,040
response in JSON format and also as I

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:35,650
said it's communicates with a database

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,620
which is stores all the information

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:42,640
about the users group messages and also

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,640
authentication information and this all

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,860
four layers and in principle at the

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:54,760
beginning we saw that probably it's

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:57,460
necessary to just write one extension

00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,320
and do not split it into extension and

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,980
the client scream but then we found that

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,620
it can be quite difficult to write all

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:10,330
these extensions for all different

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:15,040
browsers so in our case we have a client

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:16,960
scream which which does all the job for

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,930
displaying the messages but the

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,480
extension is just a small piece of code

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,990
which is very easily to transfer between

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,050
different browsers so okay now

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:36,070
everything all these layers and what we

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:39,130
used for making this different scripts

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,980
so in principle as a client script is

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:49,990
written in JavaScript also this HTML CSS

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:53,380
as a main main when which is what we use

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,320
there and this server script is not J's

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,420
and Express J's and databases mark

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,550
already mentioned that was we are using

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:08,380
MongoDB and for keeping this database we

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:12,520
are using ham lab and now just beat

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,890
about how the database is organized

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,530
because this is also quite important

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,870
part I'm not going to too much into

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:24,400
detail about all these scripts which

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:26,980
were made like server script and the

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,850
clients pre because I think it's too

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,210
much too so about this

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:37,660
quote but here the database so it's

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:40,840
because it's MongoDB is known as QL

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:49,530
database with which is not a relational

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:56,830
database it's just contains few

00:14:49,530 --> 00:15:01,510
different tables so and the main table

00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:03,820
here is the user's table which is which

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:07,060
contains the name email and passport

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:12,210
office of scientific authentication

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:15,640
information then we have this session

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,590
which contains the cookies it means that

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,080
when you're registering or when you are

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,440
logging in all these session cookies are

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,440
created and they are stored on the

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,590
server side so the server always checks

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:37,290
whether you're allowed to access to some

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:37,290
certain API is or not and gives you some

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:46,960
possibility to reach different API and

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:50,340
also separated in table slight friends

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:54,160
groups and messages messages another

00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,820
main part of this database which

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,850
contains the text of these texts or

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,450
messages and also users which created

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:08,140
these texts and users for whom it was

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:11,560
created and on principles is how the

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,360
piece of code looks like so I don't want

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,940
to speak very much I just want to

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,130
mention about this using Mongoose

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:23,020
because people quite often as I can see

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,480
because I'm new in JavaScript right but

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,450
I can see and I'm quite surprised by

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:32,620
people not don't like to use it because

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:35,720
it's just simple way to connect the

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,649
server site or say

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:45,019
to work in not j/s with MongoDB and

00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:49,389
databases so as you can see here all

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:54,259
these fields which were which we have in

00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:56,720
in the messages table so this text

00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:59,600
created forward means that for whom it

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:05,020
was this message was created as an URL

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:08,089
and also created the creation date and

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,730
created by but whom it was created so

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,799
also because this database is not a

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:17,360
relational database it's necessary to

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,640
link it to the other tables and here you

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,850
can see that for instance created by its

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,209
referred to the user data to use of

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:31,250
table and it allows just by knowing the

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:33,830
ID very easily to find as a user name

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:37,460
and all the information of this user on

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,250
the other hand it also allowed to link

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:46,370
it dynamically for instance here just a

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:49,610
couple of lines allows to refer to

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:54,260
different tables in the same database by

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:58,640
groups users and friends and so on this

00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:05,570
how it looks just a static method method

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:10,760
for finding messages knowing just in

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:14,960
this case ID of the user and URL the

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,750
user so it's you can see here is a chain

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,730
structure chain like structure and it

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:28,190
selects some certain fields in order to

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:31,990
send it to to the client and also just

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:36,080
as I said dynamically populate with

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:38,960
depending on what the request is like

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,990
its messages for the group so for the

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,970
users or the friends and also it

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,870
populates instead of IDs

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:52,190
it's substitute IDs by names from the

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:57,980
and tables there this in principle how

00:18:52,190 --> 00:19:00,350
it looks in the database this entry one

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,690
of the entries so here you can see it

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:08,529
was created for the groups and with the

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:17,000
idea of certain group and for the URL

00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:18,559
and okay this is just one of the user so

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,080
and you can see that the password is

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:26,000
encrypted and in principle yes this is a

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:33,260
standard sink which is can be made with

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:38,390
the encryption package confession

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:42,110
package just standard thing okay so I

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:44,539
think Marco can continue because just

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:48,140
too much details in the court I don't

00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,880
going to take your time well because if

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,409
you have questions about the court we

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,409
can speak later

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:18,109
you know how to continue exactly like

00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:20,269
maybe I'll show you maybe it didn't seem

00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:21,470
like really very exciting or something I

00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:24,229
don't know it depends on your fantasy

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:28,869
maybe I would say but if you get just a

00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:31,690
bit creative you can get to things like

00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:34,820
this for example this is what I left on

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,099
Roberts and Daniel's page will be down

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,479
this is one of these are two messages

00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:41,179
that I was just like toying around with

00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,460
this is not a picture this is not just a

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,470
picture this is like this CSS going if

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,389
you ever saw these kind of things like

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,330
this is also I didn't create this

00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:52,970
Frankenstein I only like copied in a

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,970
very crude way parts of the Frankenstein

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:58,159
picture but by one girl who is I think a

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:04,639
bit like one of the authorities in the

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:06,710
sexiest drawing medium post about it

00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,779
doesn't matter like this is just like in

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,869
in mine HTML and this is just like a

00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:13,369
simple text with some style like here

00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:16,669
you can basically like really just

00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:20,599
copy-paste some inline HTML and then it

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:22,190
will no it's not protected yet but then

00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,659
it will I create anything like this for

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,659
example that I showed you or for example

00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:36,080
yeah but it can also be as simple as I

00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,669
showed like before like this these

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,259
things like that and then you see like

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:41,239
who posted it and then the text of the

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,979
message I don't know like for example

00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:47,809
now I would imagine myself using it I

00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:51,470
like to use a sound code a lot I map it

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:53,899
survive 2017 and I really like to listen

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,299
to these like long chats there and I

00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:58,309
just like to bookmark like some some

00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:01,609
some songs for example but it's not

00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,349
really divided and when you have too

00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:06,139
many comments then you're like bookmarks

00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:07,369
there like it like really down down in

00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,809
the comments and it takes a lot of time

00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,789
to load in blah blah and I felt like

00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,460
maybe I could use like this thing for

00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,830
just like leaving some kind of marks or

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,810
the time codes of the overdose when the

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:22,430
my favorite song started something like

00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:25,010
that or for example when I don't code I

00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:27,710
cook so for example if I find some

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,450
recipe that I really like and I don't

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,950
have something and then I try to replace

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,080
it with something anything you need to

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,670
works out like well then I would leave

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,320
for example for my friend something like

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:42,400
I know I replace this with that and it

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,400
was not so great try it basic use cases

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:57,410
I was thinking I don't know I don't know

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,420
how many of you are like familiar with

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,430
like like browser extensions like how

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,890
many of you have tried to read some some

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:08,780
tutorials on how to like make extensions

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:10,670
but maybe it seems a bit skilled so

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,930
maybe skip the part with the extensions

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,820
but if you haven't like had to look at

00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,060
it I kind of recommend it like if you

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,560
don't for example there are these

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:25,130
extensions like I have here like adblock

00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,530
plus just like box commercials on the

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,450
pages I created my own this was actually

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,220
the time when we met first I was

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,460
thinking with my first extension which

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:39,440
was this one to just like prevent me

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,990
from seeing Tom timeline on Facebook but

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,370
all the other pages like an economic

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,460
sense or this one I really like to use

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:54,470
like it just stops gifs and you can also

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:56,240
use this one you can there is this like

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,010
little icon that's invisible for now but

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,420
if you like just click it it just like

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,580
toggles like this and then you don't

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,030
have any messages there you can just

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,750
like you know you like see the pages it

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:11,420
was so this is one way how to do it or

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,290
if you hate this big green tea then if

00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,780
this appears this is like the other like

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:20,930
say part way interface where you log in

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,180
and walk out and do some basic settings

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:28,750
like for example I can turn it off like

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:36,170
this also this is the other way then of

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:40,910
course like now this will take me to the

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:43,300
account account page of my account where

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,950
I can like look for people and manage my

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,790
messages and friendships and requests

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,700
and things like that

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,710
it's like far from finished and this is

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,180
just like very basic design and

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,080
everything and the functionality is

00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,670
definitely not finished yet yeah just

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,250
like this bookmarks as you can see you

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,340
know these here are some messages that I

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,110
left

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,840
yeah you can see like it is the link

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,360
where it is the text of it the date when

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,520
it was posted and then also here my plan

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,440
is I'm kind of like responsible on for

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,150
this part so I my plan is then to put

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,160
here of course like delete message edit

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:23,780
message nah some of those here this is

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,100
like here you can see this is not

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:29,010
compressed this is how it look this is

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,350
just like you see each tag with a bit of

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,060
style like I was actually thinking it

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,460
would be quite maybe cool and fun

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,520
project to take some Street guys it

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,370
sprays and give them a different tools

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,130
to create some graffiti like some HTML

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:50,580
and CSS and start with this yeah and

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:52,320
this Frankenstein looks like this yeah

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,540
so these are my tags here I have

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,710
friendships like this is gray and this

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,480
is Otto you can of course unfriend them

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:03,720
here are the requests like we have some

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,090
test users I have this pretty and Bill

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,680
Gates is like thanks test users I was

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,650
like doing this API endpoints for this

00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,560
friendship for business so I created

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,090
these two people and yeah you get sent

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,270
me a friend request so I can accept it

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:23,040
or like just tell him sorry and I sent

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:26,400
to this girl yeah wait and I can also

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,960
like answer my request before she wants

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,120
to like it's like yeah this will be like

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,190
to search for users and maybe later some

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,040
maybe messages with some specific

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:41,790
content but for now it only like you can

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,470
search for users and for now I also work

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,210
with is that when you just send it empty

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,300
it sends you all the users that are in

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,610
the database and you see like this is

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,770
how it kind of looks and here I can send

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:56,130
a new friend request to this guy who was

00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,840
not on the previous bookmarks yeah then

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,900
one of these bookmarks would be also

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,550
groups but when I was personally working

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,820
on all these like a PN points for these

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,110
friendships I got a bit tired of it and

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,760
then the guys came with the idea to

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,030
create groups and I said like you can

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,030
create

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,160
to itself I think this groups part will

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,420
be probably big business also yes so

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,910
there would be one market groups and

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,340
some settings here later I don't know we

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,170
have to what exactly to put there but

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,080
something would be definitely necessary

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:33,210
yeah and here I look out and what

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:42,970
happens this is like the page disappears

00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:44,620
like this I was thinking like when we

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,630
started working on this thing like I was

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,680
thinking to give like we'll just take a

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,640
few more minutes of your time only we

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,470
were thinking like what like

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,740
technologies to use and stuff like that

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,810
and I mentioned some things and I

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,310
mentioned also this glitch I don't know

00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:06,190
how many of you maybe know this glitch

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:08,320
is calm does anyone know okay like I

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:12,190
guess like everyone knows like things

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:19,210
like goat pen and Jase fiddle and the

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:20,710
glitch is something similar but the big

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,540
difference is that this is the place

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:27,520
where you can actually create like your

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:29,170
node.js application and it just takes

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,540
like a few clicks you just have to like

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:36,400
log in with your github account there

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:41,170
like I will show you this yeah their

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,030
homepage it's like colorful things like

00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,740
that I do like it I've been using it

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,220
last year all the time before I kind of

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,600
learned how to set up a taco so I kind

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,850
of assumed that people here are more

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,530
it's like learning mindset or learning

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,700
face so maybe it can be useful and I

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,580
really wanted to show you because it

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,610
seems no one knows it yeah this is how

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:04,420
the homepage looks like these are like

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:07,480
my projects and what they really promote

00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:10,630
like what they really want to yea like

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,160
pushes that people create projects and

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,080
by default they are like publicly

00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,880
visible by anyone and you can just like

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,060
push a button and like clone the project

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,920
like to your yeah create your own Fork

00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,340
and just like change whatever you want

00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,110
like and they also like

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,450
all this stuff like tutorials how to

00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:33,070
create boards and whatever you can think

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:36,160
of this is how the environment looks

00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:41,110
like oh this is yeah this is some old

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:50,950
like basic project yeah this is like the

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:53,710
editor part yeah nothing nothing

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:56,710
familiar here are the files the point is

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,360
that you just type and the moment when

00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,770
you type it's immediately like if you

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,090
would have a phone for example next to

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,470
you or any other computer it's

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,060
immediately online it's not like

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,710
localhost you can access it anyone

00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,740
anywhere can immediately access the

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,920
application here you're like trying to

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,050
make without all this has so like I

00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,530
don't know how if for example like local

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:19,330
host local host is not enough for you at

00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,530
some point and and you don't want to

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,880
have so like you are trying something

00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,280
new and we don't want to ask so we'd

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,740
like working with Heroku for example and

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,300
all the time like having to commit your

00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,090
stuff to get and then get happened and

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,250
like actually deploys it I think this is

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,030
like really like long chain at least as

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,740
far as I managed to discover how it can

00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,630
work this is like really immediate and

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,610
quick and if you're trying to learn

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,530
which I don't know no news or anything

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,000
basically you just like really type and

00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,920
the point when you change it it's

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,390
immediately like this is the active like

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,110
page in the application that is deployed

00:30:49,390 --> 00:31:00,370
I think it's really like great maybe

00:30:53,110 --> 00:31:04,660
like just show you how our project

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:06,850
project looks like after some work of

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:14,700
you guys it looks like this this is a

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:20,010
Rigney okay this is just some very basic

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:24,400
set up for all these other other things

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:28,150
yeah yeah it's like this is like this is

00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:32,580
the server script you set up the stuff

00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:35,840
as you are like used to and of course

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,640
it's like an oj oj s environment

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,610
so you can of course I can stall like

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,350
all these note libraries and in this

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,920
case you do it like via this package to

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:49,280
Jason that here this is this classical

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Jason file and if you look for some new

00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,820
package then you just type it here and I

00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,040
don't know what it could be like

00:31:52,820 --> 00:32:01,700
anything just for example if it finds it

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,170
and it uses just NPM you click on it and

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,640
it immediately installs that if you want

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,610
to look at the documentation you see

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,980
it's on NPM J's calm you just like see

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,290
documentation and you just go on I mean

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,660
other than a couple seconds like this I

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,490
think it's easy like accessible for

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:20,360
anyone this is how I was learning my

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:22,100
like node.js first thing I think it can

00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,610
make like things three easy easy without

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,470
any like setup to things and stuff like

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,310
that it just it's like open you just

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:34,520
come and I'm not paid to do this

00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,050
advertisement this is I actually was

00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,150
looking a bit I didn't find a way how

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,040
you can pay for using it I think there

00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:44,870
is not really a way this is like a side

00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:47,270
project of some just mentioned elsewhere

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,550
of a company called Creek and they

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,000
created some decide Kanban one of those

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,530
like fail more like successful Kanban

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,740
applications for team to cooperate and

00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,060
this is just there's a project here like

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,430
you can of course like the points that

00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:07,010
you could collaborate with people here

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:13,160
are my colleagues now that can access I

00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:15,080
go so what you can do is options yeah

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,760
the point thing is like by default the

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,290
every project is like turns out that it

00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,210
can be publicly accessible to anyone

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,090
like meaning like that they can see the

00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,940
code but you can switch it like normally

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:29,420
it would be like me private and of

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,580
course if it is like you can connect it

00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,850
to your github its iconic github but you

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:40,600
can like create like access to your

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,600
repository and push and pull and backup

00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,089
[Music]

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,840
and then maybe like really extremely

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,429
briefly about some small plans for the

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,250
future like because this is like really

00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:02,080
very basic prototype and of course it's

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,549
only a hobby project we don't plan to

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,980
start in a startup or something like

00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,929
that like trying to sell it or like push

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,929
some advertisements to people through

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:12,700
different channels but we still have

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,879
like some plans to like kind of bring it

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:18,220
to some bit more interesting state like

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,740
now by default when you post a message

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,659
it's accessible to you and your friends

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,980
and we also want to do it like the

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,260
Facebook style kind of the Duchannes

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,780
which is on yourself choose also for

00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:32,530
anyone without any friendships things

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,570
going on and also for the groups then

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:39,760
one of the problems that I really don't

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:42,669
like is this you probably didn't notice

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,820
but like when someone would post like

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:48,310
any of this like HTML like code instead

00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,750
of a message and you don't any any rule

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,369
that you don't specify and it is

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,190
specified by the page where it gets

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:57,220
injected it just like the style of the

00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,960
page leaks into your things and

00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,970
sometimes it's really ugly like I was

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,940
struggling a bit with these two things

00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,680
that I was and the other thing so I

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,550
don't for example with this one I don't

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,950
really know how to solve yet it will be

00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,599
a small challenge so that even though

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,390
Otto already has some ideas but we

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,200
didn't have time to discuss it yet then

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:22,470
under problem is this URLs like you know

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,170
that someone some sometimes there are

00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,300
parts of the URLs are like this query

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:31,960
strings or for example this campaign

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,320
like you know like this question mark

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,000
UTM Facebook campaign ID blah blah blah

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,890
and this is like the links that you

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,690
cannot really beat and if you now I

00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,200
think we store like the whole the whole

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:47,339
like URL this is something that we will

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,960
somehow need to figure out a way how to

00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:52,210
do it so that only the relevant part of

00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,910
this URL is next door I also personally

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:58,030
don't really have any idea yet how to

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,589
approach that and also like as a small

00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,579
small challenges

00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:05,289
to learn to work with indexdb and be

00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,059
able also to like get rid of those tags

00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,999
when they all read like to put them into

00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:12,339
some kind of like being there so that

00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:14,440
they are not really visible and I would

00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:16,390
prefer not to store this stuff like in

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,579
the central database but just on the

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,019
user's machine and I really find this

00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,400
index to be in general like quite

00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:23,109
interesting like for some offline

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,210
applications for example in general and

00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:29,109
so on so I would like to learn to work

00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:32,380
with that so it's one of the last ones

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:34,420
that I would like to mention and that's

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:39,849
it like repository like you could have

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:41,109
seen on on these slides if we don't we

00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,630
don't have it like if you would want to

00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:45,460
use it for example you cannot really

00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,079
find it like among these official like

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,239
Chrome extensions it's not there yet

00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,269
because first we are not finished and

00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:55,599
second you can just like on the

00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:57,549
repository and you like oh like if you

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,680
know how to load the extensions in the

00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:04,299
development mode then you just load the

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,489
folder built and you can use it we did

00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:07,869
some small like change of our database

00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:09,819
just before Christmas and we really

00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:11,829
didn't have time to like really figure

00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:15,039
out some things especially with this

00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:16,930
friendship stuff which is my part so

00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,509
friendships will not work for now but

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,249
others otherwise you can already use it

00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:24,640
for yourself and then I hope in next

00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:28,019
days I will just fix those several parts

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,019
that I am responsible

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,420
