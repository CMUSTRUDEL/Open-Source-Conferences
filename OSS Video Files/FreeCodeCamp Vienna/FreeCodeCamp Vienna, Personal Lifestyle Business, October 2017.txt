I'm your web Selina from Finland do you

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,490
know working like this or all right yeah

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,139
yeah so it's not the African or yeah I

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,730
mean it's somewhere it's somewhere but I

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,910
mean it's really nice sunny place Please

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,590
Please with it so yeah so this talk it's

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,949
it's pretty much about me I mean how I

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,410
ended up here in Vienna in this Meetup

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:32,009
so I mean it'll go a bit back and you

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,469
will learn how I ended up here and I

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,420
mean for me the last three years step in

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,850
the let's say most intense years of my

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,770
life and especially this year I mean

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,329
this year I I went to like eight to

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,050
eight countries I still have one country

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,690
left I gave like 20 talks I look I'm

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,820
still learning German I'm kind of and I

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,460
learned a lot of things I experienced

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,430
more than introduced before so it just

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,469
does something or at 9-year I'm kind of

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,379
writing my third or fourth book at the

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,719
moment I got this out earlier this year

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,430
it's really heavy book I mean you can

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,720
use it as a weapon about job about

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,340
against zombies or something but I mean

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,369
it's like my final kite is about web

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,909
pack I have to popularize the tool I'm a

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:18,240
part of the core team I received my

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,040
first award this year I mean I did a lot

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,220
of things in three years and the point

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,799
is to kind of show how I did it I mean

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,689
it's a lot of things I would have loved

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,360
to know three years ago before I started

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,979
because I was a said a lot of time so

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,920
now I'm sharing this I'm trying to share

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,710
this wisdom with you so let's get

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,979
started

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,899
so actually the whole thing started by

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,780
by by the fact that I found a blog post

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,990
about webpack I was ever ever of the to

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,149
lie

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,430
I knew the tool but I mean that

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,070
documentation was really awful I mean it

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,070
was like let's see if I can find it I

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,020
mean the point was that you went to web

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,119
backside and there's this cube and then

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,610
there is this picture and then there is

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,229
this code I didn't understand so the

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,940
plug post it kind of made me understand

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,870
a little bit more and then I understood

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,319
that maybe result right kind of cookbook

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,260
right back so I mean I started this with

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,120
Christian and phony and I mean at this

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,700
comment I I was just like we shall do

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,709
something about this and it kind of went

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,239
from there so I mean I made one comment

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:32,549
and because of that I'm here so I will

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,299
discuss a few topics like a

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,980
intrapreneurship lifestyle and this

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,780
person outside because these are kind of

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,739
intertwined because I'm speaking about

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,980
personal lifestyle business and what I

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,629
learned in the process so let's start

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,099
with entrepreneurship I mean this is

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:54,720
really support in Fitness it's great to

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:57,390
use it means trying so when you're an

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,730
entrepreneur in Finland you're what one

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,099
who tries it tells a lot about the

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,690
mentality we have so I mean is just try

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,220
and try a bit of my background I mean I

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,359
did vocational studies I studied

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,730
electronics I mean this is like 2004 so

00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:17,340
I went to university the point was to

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,230
study more electronics but they quit the

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,950
program or whatever so then I went into

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,049
software engineering 10 in 2005 there

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,870
was this course course in university and

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,579
it was about computer graphics I didn't

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,489
want to learn Photoshop I didn't want to

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,530
learn 3dsmax or something so I started

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,639
looking in this open source options like

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,650
the Kim or blender I mean blender is

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,389
like the whim of trades which it's

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,060
really difficult application to learn to

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,250
use but I mean I managed to learn to use

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,540
it and then I figured that maybe I can

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,280
improve this application because I

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,840
already know how to program in C and

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,459
then I figured that yeah this has been

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,650
written in C so I started writing these

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,660
little patches for the correct I mean so

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,129
I became a maintainer of blender so if

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,900
you use blender you have bit of my code

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:06,090
in the application then after University

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,650
I ended a free in the free laughing so I

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,739
started doing these little gigs for

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,780
local clients it didn't work out well

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,370
because the pay wasn't good and I mean I

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,169
didn't know a lot about business and

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,750
then I did some collaboration with

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,440
startups that didn't go well I mean I

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,810
was kind of stuck so this was like a

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,610
dead end for me so a sane person at this

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,379
point would have gotten a job

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,969
I mean you just go - I mean interview

00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,199
like today there was this position

00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,659
you're going interview and you get the

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,039
job I mean you get one job I mean 300

00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,710
types or whatever and they get the job

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,050
but I mean the up didn't feel like

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,759
something for me so I was like let's do

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,990
products let's write books because that

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,150
has to be easy like because it's only

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,490
writing right so you write and write and

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,349
and put it out and hope that it works so

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,479
I was like let's do this so I mean of

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:52,919
course it doesn't go that way I mean you

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,770
can have just write books and expect a

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:59,039
sell but I think I got a little lucky on

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,870
that but I mean on the background why I

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,870
decided to start writing I mean there's

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,909
the taste comment I made and there's

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,039
also this trend because if you look at

00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:12,629
JavaScript it's everywhere so it's it's

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:15,210
on most sites on the web NPM exploded so

00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:16,680
I mean we have like 500,000 models I

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,710
mean in three years we have 1 million

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:24,240
moles so it's a crazy amount of packages

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,090
for it for JavaScript and yeah there was

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,669
this blog post that's where the book

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,310
idea started and then I started kind of

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:35,580
with this week eating I started pitching

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,669
it to a publisher they said no but I

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,620
made more on that later about background

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,960
as well I mean this is what I saw in the

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,699
markets earlier so this it was really

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,250
confusing because I mean you have lot of

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,639
these new solutions how do I survive

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,069
this or how do I deal with this I mean

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,389
it's like this is really famous person

00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,419
in Finland but you don't get referenced

00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,810
but I mean it's like what's the point

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:02,610
so I mean yeah so because if you write a

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,569
book you cannot write a book about

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,789
everything so I was like let's choose a

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,250
couple of technologies I chose react

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,849
because it seemed like a good idea at

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,729
the time

00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:16,560
nobody used to react yet as chose I

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,870
chose webpack because of the blog post I

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,310
chose Babel I searched flow easily these

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,069
little tools that seemed to go well

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:27,599
together so stem I started writing about

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:29,460
these topics so when it comes to

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,139
business I decided that maybe I can do

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,000
something about the mess because we are

00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,459
in this huge mess and people are

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,139
struggling so let's help people delay it

00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,940
deal with the mess so let's just write

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,110
these books or kind of do whatever it

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,740
takes to help

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,710
a bit then I endure for this brand

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,720
I mean I had domain from years back this

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,250
survived tasted calm and I was like yeah

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,620
it's not that bad so let's use it in the

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,690
book in the first book I wrote the point

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,850
was that because I knew Kanban from the

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,740
past it's this process management thing

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,140
that you make these lanes and then you

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,640
have these tasks I figured that this is

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,500
like small application I can write in

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,690
the in the book so you read my book and

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,850
you learn to write this it looks really

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,700
simple but it actually takes quite a bit

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,000
of time to get it done because you have

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,650
you have some complex state but I mean

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
it was enough enough for the market at

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,680
the time you can say that how I I moved

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,260
with the book so I have this kicksled on

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,600
the first one it was 2015 when I get got

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,110
the book out I mean I was just let's

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,910
test the market so kicksled there was no

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,860
order on the book to cover because I

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,300
wasn't so sure if it's good idea to put

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,290
the name on the cover if if the

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,320
continent that great so I mean the point

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,000
was is let's let's put something there

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,370
then I was like nobody understands this

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,010
reference because it's kicksled nobody

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,510
in the world knows what the kicksled is

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:58,410
so I mean most people know these San

00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:01,230
Francisco Brits so let's try that then

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,870
it started evolving I mean then I got I

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:08,220
mentally I I got courage to put the name

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,540
there so yeah then I got some cover and

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,730
then someone said that it's it's

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,430
depressing depressing or something or we

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,410
cannot use this so I found something

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,120
more happy I have this happy cover I

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,240
mean really really black metal cover I

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,400
went to this stock photo site and I was

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,800
just going through the images and I

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,610
found this site I really like the shape

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,650
it's like this turbine turbine thing and

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,740
I was like this is really nice it's like

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,479
heavy metal thing so I will use this so

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,310
the natural step then another friend

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,420
told me that it's too dark you cannot

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,670
use this so I gave this stock photo I

00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,620
gave it to the friend and the friend

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,320
gave me a logo back so that's how I got

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,540
my logo so I mean he took the shape and

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,230
he turned it into something nice so this

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,990
is what I use at the mall

00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:03,610
and the point is I can just at these

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:05,740
things that the logo here it's just one

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,960
important points it was like one book at

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,390
first it was book about because I

00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,650
started writing about and then I

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,990
realize that I'm writing a book about

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,330
the epic and react so just one book

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,830
about webpack and react but then time

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,779
went on and on and I realized that I

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,670
have two books in one so then I split it

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,390
up so if you bought my first book then

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,680
you got two books and actually now then

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,130
I realize that I have this book

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:34,150
here it's like 500 pages or 400 1998 is

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:36,550
because 500 to be too much so I realized

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,980
that I mean it's it's it's far too much

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,540
so what I started doing and I'm still

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:46,330
doing this I I'm doing a new book that's

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,640
like I took a part of the old book and I

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,830
did another book and I crew it into kind

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,410
of I took like 50 pages from the old and

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,570
I added a lot of content I'm still

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,950
adding content so now I get new book so

00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,560
I get like three books out of one book

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,470
and I might do another book based on the

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,570
big book because it's too weak so yeah

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:11,080
this is how I write so I write too much

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:13,690
and I split and I have more books but

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,180
yeah about publishing so when I was

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,770
starting out I was pitching this idea

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,060
that yeah it's all it will be a really

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,940
good idea to write this book about

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,000
webpack they were like nope

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:29,260
we won't do this but I was like this is

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,510
good idea so I will do it anyway so then

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,600
I went through this lean parting at the

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,680
point is that they give you this

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,440
processing flow I mean you write write

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,350
your book in markdown and I will process

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,450
the markdown into PDF epub and mobi and

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,209
they will sell the book for you you will

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,610
get 90 percent so I mean derailed is

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:53,440
nice and tonight went to Amazon at one

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,060
point so I have this you can buy this

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,020
book I mean that soft cover version not

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,760
this nice one

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,380
you can buy it from Amazon so yeah I

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,160
mean you can write paper books really

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,760
really easily these days I mean it's

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,600
just amazing

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,370
once you can do but this wasn't easy I

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,230
mean it wasn't easy to get for me to get

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,019
to Vienna so I mean the first three

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,360
months I made thousand dollars in three

00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:22,810
months it's it's not a lot of money for

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,350
a lot of work so then someone found me I

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,910
mean this was Rodriguez from Spain I

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,290
mean he saw that I was trying I was

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,630
trying really hard I was pushing

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,610
releases all the time and so so he saw

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,500
that I was trying and he decided to help

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,720
so we started going to the content he

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,060
was like my technical editor he kind of

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,610
taught me how to write so he gave me

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,240
this kind of he helped me to improve my

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,220
style and I think it it was kind of the

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,529
thing that made it work for me and I

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,850
also had to think about this publishing

00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,100
model because I was giving out the

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,110
content for free and I was still selling

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,360
something so if you have something free

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,370
maybe you take the free thing instead of

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,639
buying buying the thing if it's free so

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,380
I think about this as well but then kind

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,029
of things start to come together and I

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,680
was in the right time in the market

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,269
because reactor still growing so I ran

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,750
into this problem that I mean you have

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:18,310
this open and closed approaches like if

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,949
you think about traditional publishing

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:24,010
its closed so that you you get the you

00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:26,260
pay first and then you get the book and

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,329
the point is that yeah is it makes sense

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,000
to pay in this case but I mean it

00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:33,880
there's it's it's more difficult to

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,760
collaborate in this case and you also

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,579
need money for marketing so I meant this

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,399
because when you start writing nobody

00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:47,019
knows you they don't really care so I

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:49,510
chose open approach how this works is I

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,880
have this book site I mean you can find

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,670
the content online I mean this this

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,010
brings people do we they find my content

00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,190
they find my name they find my books

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:04,240
they get some trust I mean I because you

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,370
need trust to sell so I mean I mean so

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,050
late I get they feel bad because they

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,850
read through your book they start

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,010
feeling bad I mean the content was good

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,089
I still pay so that's how I make my

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:20,060
money here by making people feel bad

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:23,180
yeah this another thing I learned

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,310
because I mean if I go alone I can

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,110
travel really fast but the problem is

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,140
that I end up in some weird place I

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,820
don't even know if I want a decoder so

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,370
then I figure that it's good to have

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,910
some people around me so actually in the

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:41,110
book side let's say you need help you

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:43,790
click this button yeah I need help and

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,070
then you get to get get to talk with me

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,960
so you can chat I mean you have a

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,680
problem and then you open the chat and

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,140
you ask something

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:55,520
so I mean I started gathering these

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:57,320
people around me and I mean sometimes

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,320
it's overwhelming because people ask go

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,450
ask questions all the time but I think

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,980
it's kind of the price you have to pay

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,420
but the interesting thing is that it's

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,580
more fun to do things together than

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,490
alone I mean I don't know why but so it

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,940
used to be so there's this community

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,040
aspect so there's at website you can get

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,630
the content there and there is discuss

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,150
comments and I'll show you so let's

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:28,910
let's go to this web back book will

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:33,920
here's a free person or like composing

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:35,780
so I have two chapter and in the end you

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,420
have comments so people have problems or

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,060
whatever and they're like yeah this is

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,260
good but I'm not going to test it I mean

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,420
this is too complicated no water or

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,120
water I get feedback and I can improve

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,890
so I mean it was really important for me

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,120
to get this feedback loop going because

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,280
if you don't get feedback you can't

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,630
improve so yeah so I mean this was one

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,390
of the smart things I did I set up the

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:02,450
book side and I set up chat and discuss

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:09,320
comments and wherever I and also half

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:12,170
get up so let's have like this is for a

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,000
new book my newest book so I mean you

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,280
can fat the conv here and then I have to

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,470
get up issues so here are all the things

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:22,250
that have to have to happen or have to

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:25,730
be done the manga to me content down I

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,740
would write a pull request and then I

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,710
get a long discussion on if it's good or

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,310
not and I get this I get feedback here

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,259
so I mean this allows me to get better

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,970
so I like this process a lot I mean

00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:42,430
github it's not only for coding it's

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:44,740
also right for writing in terms of

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,839
technology there is I mean it's marked

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,089
down I mean it's mostly nice it's not

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,910
always nice but I mean it's quite good

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,309
and yeah you have the kidnapping and I

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,559
wrote my own tool you think using the

00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:58,569
technology I I wrote about this

00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,290
something based on web a can react it's

00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:04,660
like web pack for static sites I mean it

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,970
has one user I think I'm into users me

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,769
and site I don't think know

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,819
anybody else who uses I don't want that

00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,790
you use it because I don't want to

00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:15,870
support it so I mean don't use this much

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:18,249
don't use my tool use something else I

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,220
hosted on github pages I have CloudFlare

00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:26,410
on and this bits in front yeah I get

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:28,839
your disgust because I'm by my heart I'm

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,829
a developer so I when it comes to

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,689
releasing books I think like a developer

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:38,199
so because I had this past in open

00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:40,059
source I decided let's do this fast

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,290
light releases so maybe we publish

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,110
something every month or every week or

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,470
whatever so I added this versioning for

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,629
e-books

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,079
it's like bit like semver before books

00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:51,550
and when I active I mean and I I'm

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,559
really writing this seems to work so

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,839
when you just push and push the convent

00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,809
it gets attention and people like to

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:05,169
take it to get new content I rightfully

00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:07,899
it's not in my blog I'm sure that one of

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,659
the good things I did I interviewed a

00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:14,589
lot of people I don't know if you heard

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:18,309
about this relic sting but I mean in

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:20,079
2015 nobody knew Redux I did this

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,850
interview and it's it exploded in

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,699
popularity so maybe that was coincidence

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,890
or not I don't know but I mean I did I

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:31,270
have done a lot of interviews so it's

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,070
always always the same questions and you

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,730
can go go through these interviews and

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,809
you can learn amazing an amazing amount

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,640
so I mean sometimes the people I

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,799
interview they are not famous yet but

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,850
some and then some like here or two goes

00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,570
and there are temporary famous so it's

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,309
it's

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:54,669
about helping people I mean it's not all

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:56,380
about business but yeah the key part

00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:00,370
here is that release get feedback

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,169
release improve but marketing I mean you

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:06,370
can again write a book but if nobody

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:09,309
knows you it exists it doesn't matter so

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,009
yeah I've got site and then I have

00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,450
something else I have Twitter I don't

00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,049
have facebook because I don't like

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,820
Facebook but I mean I have to feed her

00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:20,139
and I mean this is I think this is

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,889
enough for me so I just push something

00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:26,039
every day and people get costed content

00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:32,399
and I can push my releases to release I

00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:35,350
also have a mailing list yeah interviews

00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:37,480
big why I did this interviews I mean it

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,820
just just a random thing someone

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,889
proposed to me that let's do interview I

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,629
think it was missile missile from Mobius

00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:48,549
and we did one interview I was like this

00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,440
is a good idea let's do more so now like

00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,389
70 interviews or something like that so

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,129
it's some effort for me because the

00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:57,190
point is that some people they have

00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:59,409
great ideas but they take em up right up

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,450
well or taken up edit that well so what

00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:03,639
I do I propose this interview very

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,649
collaborate a bit I improved the content

00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:07,480
I put it as positive as far as I can I

00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:11,580
pushed the quality I get it through

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,840
people so everyone is happy in the drive

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,179
but the others more than marketing I

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,769
mean you can have a nice book you can

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,600
reach the people but if they if there's

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,529
no reason to buy or if you don't do this

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,700
right it doesn't work but so you have a

00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,669
cell and you have to think about P

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,879
suppose so for me I mean ice

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,009
I started from books and it was kind of

00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:35,110
successful because I mean the to this

00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,620
date I have sold well over 4,000 books

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,110
myself

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,909
I mean soft published books it's it's

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,029
like hundred thousand dollars which is

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:45,159
some wonderful money but I mean yeah

00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,259
writing books it's fun but it takes time

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,669
so maybe there's something else so I

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:54,309
tried contracting at one point so I had

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,250
this table library someone found it on

00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:00,549
internet and from somewhere from San

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:04,330
Francisco that means money so

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:08,529
yeah so they gave me money to develop my

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:10,719
own product my own library so I added

00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:14,289
this reactor power thing for reacts it's

00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:16,179
more like a type of framework I think I

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,769
could monetize this better I'm not

00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,349
making a lot of money out of this but I

00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:22,239
mean people like the component people

00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:25,599
like to libraries so I mean it's

00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:28,029
something for reference at least but the

00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,799
problem for me is that I mean yeah I got

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:33,509
some nice money short term but I met I

00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:36,369
mean I was sacrificing long term success

00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:39,369
and then I realized that yeah I have

00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:43,209
this book and a lot of important people

00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:45,639
read my books so maybe I can use this

00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:48,849
market as a marketing funnel so I mean I

00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:50,079
have this huge net huge reads and I can

00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:52,389
sell something more valuable to these

00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,729
people so I kind of find in the Coulson

00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:57,759
thing I'm training business so this

00:20:54,729 --> 00:21:00,489
means that some big company they have

00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,739
some specific specific need they want me

00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:04,539
to come and help them for a week or two

00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:07,089
and they are willing to pay so I can do

00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:09,039
that and I've done this to mama tomorrow

00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:11,769
amount and I think it's a good model

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,809
because you have this big big net and

00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:16,869
then you have this really expensive

00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:19,539
thing that you offer on top of that so

00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,889
it seems like good compromise so you can

00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,959
make really nice money for our little

00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:24,579
while and then you have something basic

00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:28,379
that makes a little bit bit of money and

00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:31,149
it's like the safety safety in in life

00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:32,529
so at the moment I'm somewhere somewhere

00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,409
in between so I write when I have time I

00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:38,469
write when I get good contract I go to

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:41,499
the client and I help the client so yeah

00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:43,450
books and upsell everything else I go to

00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,799
one more thing I go to courses but I

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,329
mean other I don't have time for

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,729
everything so I have to kind of choose

00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:54,879
so results I mean the fact that I'm here

00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:56,829
it's one result another thing I mean if

00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:59,799
I did this all alone let's say I spent

00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:01,959
one year like hiding in my cave writing

00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,629
the book and published I don't think

00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:06,579
it'll work I think it's important to

00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:07,779
have that feedback loop because that's

00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:12,389
how you get to call it that's how you

00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:14,470
get what people want so yeah some books

00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:17,619
some trance place

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:20,460
paper books and yeah there's some

00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:22,809
readers I'm actually paying readers I

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,999
don't I mean doesn't that was more

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:29,019
uttered outside I mean just three

00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:31,330
readers freeloaders whatever so an

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,950
hundred more than hundred contributors I

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,230
mean more than hundred people gave their

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,210
work back to me because I'm done there

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,869
I'm doing good thing in the open they

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:42,039
want to help me to improve the content

00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:46,119
so why not

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:49,419
and earlier this year in May

00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,730
I got award I mean I got this block of

00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:55,450
wood they gave me a block of wood for

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:57,759
for my efforts and I gave me this title

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,460
finished called ambassador so it's like

00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:04,059
the Oscar of software development in

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,639
Finland so I got this distinct this year

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:08,529
I mean it's not it's just more like

00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:10,210
recognition so I mean it's like yeah you

00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:15,609
did a good job here's a block of wood

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:17,289
thing kind of thing yeah and I've been

00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:20,259
touring I mean I started touring this

00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:23,769
year so I've seen a lot of Europe I met

00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:28,299
a lot of people and I have a had really

00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:30,879
good interesting lines and we did any

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:34,119
pandal I mean this was adding PD dis

00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:36,190
twice the point was that we can everyone

00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,950
on their own thing and reads only one

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,919
slice of the market so the point was to

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,899
get like six orders together and sell

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,899
something for a week I think we made

00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:48,749
like $40,000 in one week because we were

00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:51,129
in the right place in the right time

00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:53,169
so again just something for marketing or

00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:56,559
something to keep in mind because if you

00:23:53,169 --> 00:24:00,129
can collaborate it's always better but

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,570
this missus thing I started like I

00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:03,340
started understanding how business goes

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,519
how I can make money and how I can

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,769
publish prediction so but I mean I

00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:12,549
wasn't really happy happy person so I

00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:15,039
was like I think I had to I mean this

00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:18,220
year I got this offer by reactive conf

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:22,239
that let's do a tour so that gave me an

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,269
excuse to travel in April and I'll tell

00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:26,619
a bit about that in here because it's I

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,060
mean it dis led to changes in my

00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:30,100
lifestyle with this element

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:33,070
fine in Finnish which means the way of

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,610
living yeah so I will move from business

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:38,050
to the lifestyle so how I used to

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,480
Labour's like this so let's wake up

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,780
around 7:00 and maybe I'm like terminus

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,070
in bed because I don't like to wake up

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,560
let's eat some breakfast check check

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,840
some email let's check out RSS what's

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,240
happening in the world let's do some

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,010
work let's go for a quick run on a

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,570
treadmill because I mean it's winter

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,510
it's dark you cannot go outside because

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:02,110
it's my own story so yeah I heard

00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,700
treadmill and then let's put some lunch

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,700
in the microwave eat it fast

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,070
let's do again let's do more work let's

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,430
go for a quick run on a treadmill let's

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:15,240
eat some dinner we ate at 5 so that's

00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:17,800
important now if you go north be it at 5

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,050
then I have some chill time so let's

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,910
play games let's go to Sun I mean sound

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,010
is important that's one thing you go to

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,500
Finland you go zone

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,420
yeah and let's go to sleep and here we

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,020
go again so I mean my life was like this

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,940
for all of mine of course there was

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,160
exceptions I was really lazy during

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,290
summer so I mean summer is like it's

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,410
soap right I mean you have like 20 hour

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:45,850
days so I mean it seems this kind of

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:47,740
you're it says everything so yeah but I

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:52,090
mean I had to escape so I went to nature

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:53,680
and I did strong thing but yeah I mean

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,140
winters they were really really tough

00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,510
for me I mean if you want to become a

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,250
happier person go to Finland spend one

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,590
winter because you will never complain

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,320
up one complain about winter if you

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,490
spend one winter there so I spent 30

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,400
winters so I know something about

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:13,360
Turkish I mean it's not the cold is a

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:17,980
darkness so I was living this minimalist

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,810
style life if it's good anyway so I got

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,760
things done but I mean is there more to

00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,340
life than this I mean again I can live

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:29,200
like this I can make money and I can

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,820
just kind of go into this cycle but but

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,700
yeah then I started like I got this

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,740
opportunity because someone found my

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,660
book and they were like we can use you

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,210
we can use this person for marketing so

00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,010
let's do this and I was like yeah let's

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,890
let's do this because it's good idea

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:48,040
we do see the Europe so we spent like

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,320
April just going from place to place we

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:54,130
did like Berlin and we did check and we

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,020
did Slovakia at last season it was in

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,760
Vienna I mean it was really kind of

00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,140
random thing because I was supposed to

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,530
go to London but I mean the longing

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:08,290
cancelled so I end up in Vienna it was

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,630
kind of a chance for me to do something

00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,000
I had not done before so I mean I was

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,800
living in this little bubble so I was

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,920
like let's go a bit outside of the

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:21,970
bubble so sometimes you have to go

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,590
beyond what you are and it does kind of

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,930
because the plan must spend one month

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,960
and then go back home and go back to old

00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:32,070
life and it didn't go that way because I

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,330
I left Finland like end of March and

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:38,860
since then I've been back to Finland for

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:41,110
two weeks because I mean I was like I

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,510
did this first tour I went back for a

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,160
week and then I did another tour then I

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,230
went back for a week and a liter tour

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,430
this is my third tour I'm going back for

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:54,010
a week in in like a week but it's like

00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,710
it kind of changed the way I think about

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,940
how to live a life because when you when

00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,890
you see what's outside of your bubble

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:06,250
maybe you don't want to go back to the

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:07,960
bubble yeah so but I mean why we Anna

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,860
why why not Berlin or why not

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,270
London or something else let's say I

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,910
made some friends I made some new

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,590
connections and I was like this is I

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:23,830
mean the city likes me and I like the

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:27,010
city so why not you can read my story

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,080
about this I mean I won't go into this

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:33,550
data detail but I mean again we'll do

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,470
later and as it happens we ni Slyke in

00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,420
center of Europe if you want to travel

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,910
it's a good place to travel I mean you

00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:44,890
can get to Barcelona for 80 euros it's

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:46,420
like so cheap and it's so first but yeah

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,900
now my life I don't have the schedule

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,510
anymore

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,340
I sleep as late as I like then I go to

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,870
office hang with my friends I mean I

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,350
just doesn't work then we have one hour

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,000
lunch like Vienna style

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,000
it might be to other lands you know

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,100
because we are not so let's say we are

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,410
not we are into a life here instead of

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,530
doing this microwave lunches we go for a

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,750
proper lunches and yeah

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,090
I still get work done and I'm happier I

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:16,289
have let's say a personal life so it's

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:18,270
not all about fun and games but the

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:20,220
thing is I I got little successful in

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:24,870
business and then it led to change in

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,480
lifestyle and it kind of it was a really

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,880
good thing but then you get questioned

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,669
like now now but now you have this

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,890
chance to change the way you live your

00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:36,480
life so what kind of lifestyle you

00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,860
actually want is it good to travel

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,230
around or do you want to stick with some

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:45,000
CD or whatever what so this is like the

00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:46,740
thing I have to figure out but yeah so

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,840
you have the business thing the changes

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,789
that changes your lifestyle and life

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,039
start it starts to change your personal

00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:56,039
life because now we get this lifestyle

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,860
and then you have to person inside the

00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:04,409
business this really is about 10 o'clock

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:06,960
afternoon yes so yeah it's personal so

00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:10,049
let's say you run this personal

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,309
lifestyle business so you're literally

00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:17,130
the business so this means that whatever

00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:19,679
you how you feel or how you're doing it

00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,929
affects your business so based on this

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,370
logic it makes sense to kind of optimize

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:26,640
your own happiness or you have to be

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:29,760
kind of in a good shape I mean in mental

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,289
terms in physical terms because it all

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,270
affects the business so I have this

00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:35,010
business and it affects the lifestyle

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,510
its effects personal side which affects

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,940
the business so you have this tiny

00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,860
little loop because if you're really

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,299
depressed and not happy with life you

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,070
don't get anything done and then it

00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,230
means business is bad and you get really

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,730
sad because this is bad and yeah you

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,870
cannot maintain your lifestyle and but

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,510
you have to get in this positive cycle

00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:57,480
so this business is it's not about

00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:00,000
making the biggest amount of money it's

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,970
more about enabling good life for me

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,940
because it's really kind of its business

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:09,280
for me it's not for someone else is it's

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,830
just enabling my life in a way

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,500
so this means that I can invest into

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:18,160
myself I have to think what what makes

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,930
sense in I mean so that I can grow as a

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,200
person because then I again get more

00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:26,320
done with the business but there's a

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,850
risk so let's say your personal life

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,560
doesn't go well then business is going

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,450
to suffer or let's say business is going

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,250
to it's not going so well it's going to

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,820
affect your personal life so I have to

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:39,820
be a little careful with this but I mean

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,620
personally I grew this business but then

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,630
I realized that I had some limit because

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,470
I can't go on with this far so I have to

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,720
change but the thing is it it seems you

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,620
cannot your honor never ready so I have

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,740
to learn new things

00:31:50,620 --> 00:32:00,760
like every day what essentially happened

00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:03,100
for me is that I was in this Sun box so

00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,380
I was in this situation I mean I was

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,480
like kind of stuck in life so this meant

00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,300
that I had to change myself so I had to

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,900
learn a lot of things I never knew about

00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,670
and I'm still kind of doing this and

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,590
there's actually Viktor Viktor Frankl

00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,510
Museum I don't know if you see that name

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,850
but there's a Viktor Frankl Museum in

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,610
Vienna it's quite close it's like two

00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,020
kilometers west little coder because

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:31,290
it's going to change the way I think

00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,290
about life so just like logo tip

00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,580
effectively I went from no life to life

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:40,270
I started understanding what no life

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:43,600
means so I mean it's like it's really

00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,370
kind of it's fun to notice that there's

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,870
more to life than what you already know

00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,280
so I step bubbling so we have this

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,530
bubble and you get outside of the bubble

00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,270
when you pick your bubble so maybe one

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,160
day I go outside of this bubble and find

00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,160
him a bigger bubble but I mean we'll see

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,900
so you know this so we friend went from

00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:03,970
Apes to something else and then we went

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,220
to computers I don't know if there this

00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:11,140
is progress but I mean it's more fun to

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:14,440
be here than here and this for me so

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:18,700
what I learned lessons learned of it

00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:22,059
really really simple yeah

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,980
so yeah running books is hard but I

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,119
think anyone can write a book I mean

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,909
writing is not the problem

00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,649
you can get some kind of book done but I

00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:31,359
mean it's the marketing and selling a

00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:32,830
script that are really hard you can

00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,529
write something but I mean if nobody

00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,419
cares nobody cares nobody will buy so I

00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:40,600
will say it's at least as important to

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:42,759
put the thought or focus into marketing

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,950
and selling maybe it makes sense to find

00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,879
the customer first and develop the

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,320
product based in customer and for me

00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:52,539
personally I mean it's the program croch

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,109
because you have to be able to learn and

00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:59,470
change it's it's surprising I mean it's

00:33:56,109 --> 00:34:03,220
pretty hard but I mean it's something

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,649
you have to do when it comes to business

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,619
I would say every business in the world

00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:10,720
is it's based on trust so before you can

00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:13,690
get the big deal you need a lot of trust

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,389
and it begins from something simple so

00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,859
for me it was having that sight and

00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:21,099
making allowing people to find me and

00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:23,859
build a little bit of trust that gives

00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:26,760
kind of opportunity for me to gain more

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:28,960
trust and gain gain deals and so on and

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,250
also this value thing you have to

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,619
provide something malleable for people

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:37,960
because otherwise they won't care and I

00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,450
think for a lot of programmers they are

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,690
in this doing thing they are really good

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:46,659
at doing things but they're really bad

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:49,240
at telling things so you have have

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,480
really big fat value like I don't know 1

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,569
million or I don't know 10 millions

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,640
times 0 which is 0 you won't have any

00:34:55,569 --> 00:35:01,390
luck because if you do great things and

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,609
you don't tell nobody cares we also have

00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,780
these people that don't do anything they

00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:07,119
just dealt yeah I have this great idea

00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,799
let's do this and it's like they won't

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,839
get lucky because they're doing actually

00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:13,450
anything they're just telling things so

00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:15,339
annek you need bit of both so you need

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,380
to be doing things so I mean for me it's

00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:20,349
writing and in need to be telling things

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,569
so just a marketing marketing thing when

00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:24,910
you do both you can actually get lucky

00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:27,270
so I mean you get opportunities so like

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:31,319
one friend put it what I did I built

00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,319
opportunity machine in my for myself

00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,910
and there's always something new around

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,740
the corner so now you get good at

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,400
writing then then you have to get good

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,089
at something else

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,040
so never run out of things to learn I

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:46,190
just want to end this in the one little

00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,200
idea so I mean you have to be able to

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,730
dream so maybe you want to make your

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,640
life better somehow so you have some

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,589
dream and then you have to be yeah you

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,770
need courage to go towards that

00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:00,780
direction and you don't have and you

00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,730
have to remember not to give up too

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,010
easily because you could be going to the

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,650
right direction but if you give up then

00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,799
you never get to the destination so I

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,299
think that that's it for me I think I

00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:15,660
will end this here and then we have

00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:19,100
questions in the end so thank you

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,100
