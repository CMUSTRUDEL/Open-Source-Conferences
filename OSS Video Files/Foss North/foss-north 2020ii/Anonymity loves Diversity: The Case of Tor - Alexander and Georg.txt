tour and anonymity loves diversity

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,840
hello and welcome to a talk about tour

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
this time we are going to talk about

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,280
anonymity loves diversity

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
and why this is a thing which is

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,520
measuring portugal

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,720
we have prepared talking about different

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
parts of tor

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,280
and how diversity plays a role in them

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
but before we are going to do so we

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
start with a

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
short introduction about ourselves and

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
um about what what this tool thing is

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
for those of you

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
who haven't heard of it before

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,680
i'm georg i've been volunteering

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,880
for torah since 2010 and became

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,560
what is called a core tour developer

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,920
in 2013 i was mainly working on

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,560
a tour browser and the tour button and

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,320
reproducible builds efforts

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,110
eventually i started leading the tour

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
browser team

00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,439
[Music]

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,119
into 2016 and

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,840
recently moved on to so-called network

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,840
health work

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,880
my name is alex i'm also a core

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
developer with detour project i've only

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
been around

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,000
since 2017 where i started working

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
full-time on tour

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
i'm heading up towards network team

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
which is a team responsible for the tour

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
software not the browser but the little

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,640
program that is responsible for talking

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
with the network

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,200
i've been a free software developer

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,360
since 2006 i've maintained

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
a variety of small utilities i think the

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
most known one is the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
years the irc client prior to tour i was

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,440
working with various distributed systems

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
written in primarily the erlang

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
programming language

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,879
and i've also done webkit-based browsers

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,160
for the cute webkit team at nokia which

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,280
was the team responsible for also

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
delivering the

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
web browser for the n9 handsets which

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,319
was the

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,680
amigo phone that nokia developed a

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,319
couple of years ago

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
in my spare time i'm doing the annual

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
pornhack hacker festival in denmark so

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
if you're looking for a good hacker

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
festival

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,959
once we're done with this pandemic you

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,720
should definitely check out

00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,080
bournehead.dk for more information about

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
that the first thing we're going to look

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
at is what is tor

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,519
tor is an unknown anonymity and

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,640
censorship circumvention

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,480
toolset we develop a browser which

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,319
bundles a number of different smaller

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
utilities such as the actual tor

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,599
software which is the

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,040
software that speaks with the with the

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
network

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,200
everything we do is free software it's

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,200
available for people to look at

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
inspect figure out how it works help

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
solve box

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
all these kind of things we generally

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
develop it as a free software project

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,599
one of the big things we're going to

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
talk about in this presentation is the

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
torn network

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,920
it's an open network meaning that

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
everybody who wants to participate can

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,519
participate in it

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
additionally tor is also a pretty big

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
community of

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,799
researchers developers users and also

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
relay operators the relay operators are

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
the

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
human beings or organizations that are

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,319
running these

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,680
different nodes in this open network

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,680
we are registered as a 501c3 in the us

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
which means that we are a non-profit

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
with some

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,319
tax deduction possibilities if you

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,799
do donations and you are based in the

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,799
u.s

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
if we start by taking a bit of a look at

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,120
the history of tor if we go back to the

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,439
early 2000s

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
tor back then was mostly nick matthewson

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
and roger dingleton who was working

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,680
together with the u.s naval research

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,639
laboratories

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,759
on getting tore to work and getting the

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,840
first versions out

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,440
in 2004 the eff sponsor tour sort of

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,840
with the ability to start taking

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,639
donations and so on in 2006 tor

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,840
incorporated and became a non-profit

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,479
in 2008 the tor browser development

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
began

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,240
before that you would have to take a

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
browser and

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,600
make it use tor using privoxy or some

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
other tool

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,120
to establish connection to a sox proxy

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,720
this is something georg is going to talk

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
a bit about later when we talk about

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,520
application development

00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,720
in 2010 the arab spring happened

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,880
which was a time where a lot more people

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
became aware of what tor was and what

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,520
torque could provide for people

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,400
in 2013 was the summer of the snowden

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,120
revelations

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,560
where we learned about the nsa mass

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
surveillance

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,080
and snowden also talked a bit about tor

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
back then

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
in 2018 a dedicated anti-censorship team

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,120
was created in tor

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,960
to help with developing new tools and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,440
new strategies for how to circumvent

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,080
censorship in various parts of the world

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
in 2019 we shipped the tor browser for

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,240
android this was a pretty big

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
milestone tor has historically been

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,199
mostly developing

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,360
tools for linux mac and windows

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,440
and for for desktop in general but

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,759
having a mobile browser was important

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,759
because

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
more and more people are starting to use

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
their mobile devices as the primary

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,680
devices

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,120
in 2020 we created the network health

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,360
team which gerard is going to

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
expand a bit upon later the network

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
health team is responsible for

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
monitoring the tor network sort of how

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
well it's doing and

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
is there any issues with it is there

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,280
something we need to quickly look into

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,520
and so on in this photo you can see

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,680
some subset of the tour community who is

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
gathered at a developer meeting that we

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
have

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,000
usually twice a year when we're allowed

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
to travel we haven't had any this year

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,560
because of the

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,720
pandemic we collaborate and tour with a

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,479
large amount of different organizations

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
of course we collaborate with mozilla

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,520
who's developing the

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,280
firefox browser which is what tor

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
browser is based upon

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,120
but we also have some very good friends

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,080
at the guardian project which is working

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,720
on

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
mobile security tools for both android

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,759
and ios

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
we work with uni which is responsible

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
for doing a lot of monitoring

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,960
of internet censorship all over the

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
world we have

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,440
a project that we collaborate with

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,479
called the library freedom project

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,800
which is doing um training

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
of people to the point where they're

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,680
able to train other people in digital

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
safety

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,280
mostly with a librarians in the north

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
america

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,039
one interesting part of developing

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,759
anonymity tools that is slightly

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,840
different from

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
other software that we would develop is

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,280
that we can't really measure how many

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,000
users we have we have some estimates

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,599
from some different

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,440
research papers that says that we have

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,440
somewhere between two and eight million

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
daily users

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
if you were doing software like normally

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
where you are in an organization you

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
would add a lot of

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
instrumentation into the software where

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,479
you're able to measure how many users

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
what they do

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,960
which views they're focused on for how

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,479
long time they're doing it

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
same thing with social media today

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
people are looking at various indicators

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,520
for how their performance is doing

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,280
because we build anonymity systems we

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
can't really add these kind of metrics

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,599
into our softwares we can't really track

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,360
and say we have exactly this amount of

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
users so we'll have to live with some

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
kind of estimates from

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,879
the different research communities that

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,879
we collaborate with

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,160
the first thing we're going to do is to

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
sort of build up a mental model of how

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
the toy network works

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,879
before we do that we're going to give an

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,520
example on how for example

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,319
a single relay system would work this is

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
incredibly

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
similar to how a vpn provider works it

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
might be you have a vpn

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,639
provider privately that you pay for or

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
it might be your company is providing a

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
vpn

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,120
system for you in a vpn scenario you

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,360
will usually have a number of using

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
a number of users using as a single

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,759
relay in the system this is the vpn

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
server

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,039
what they will be doing is that they are

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,240
usually encrypting the traffic to the

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,919
vpn host

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,919
and then the vpn host decrypts the

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,880
traffic and sends it out at the internet

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,680
this protects sort of the user's transit

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,839
of data

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,159
between the user itself and to the vpn

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,640
provider

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,920
one of the things here is that you rely

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,399
very heavily on

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,640
the intents of the provider if the

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,839
provider is for example malicious or it

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,279
might also be that they've made some

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,959
administrative mess ups where they for

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,040
example are storing locks and they're

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,640
able to ship locks to other providers

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,519
even though they claim not to be doing

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,720
it this could be a problem

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,800
but it doesn't just have to be that the

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
organization that is providing the vpn

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,440
is malicious or

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,360
have some other problems it gives us one

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,880
big problem which is that it's a single

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,480
point of failure

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,519
so you only have to attack a single node

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,880
or a single

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,120
set of nodes to gather information about

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,519
a lot of users from this system

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,760
and additionally because most users are

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,360
sending their traffic over a single host

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,760
it would be pretty easy for an adversary

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
to do timing analysis and bridge sort of

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,680
the incoming traffic that is encrypted

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,680
with the outgoing traffic which might

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
not be encrypted and figure out which

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,959
user is responsible for which outgoing

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,959
connections of this system

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
if we instead take a look at how the

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,760
torque design is

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
in this case we zoom in on alice and bob

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,720
which is the

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,040
alice's trying to make a connection to

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,800
bob what we do now is that instead of

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,200
having a single node we add

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
a whole network of nodes which is what

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,680
we call the anonymity network

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,640
or in this case the toy network the idea

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
is that we add

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,000
several relays so that no single relay

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,200
can betray

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,880
neither alice nor bob so the first thing

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
alice does here which is an important

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
thing to understand is that alice

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,360
decides

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
which path through the network that she

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
wants to take

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
alice has through the directory system

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
we have in tour

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
an idea about every note that is

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
available to her in the tor network

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
from this she has access to their

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,320
encryption keys and thus knows what the

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
keys are

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
up front before she tries to connect to

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
them

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,760
alice decides the path and the first

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,399
thing alice does here

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,440
is that she establishes a secure session

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,519
with the first relay we call it r1

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
she then tells r1 to establish a

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
connection to r2

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,160
and does so in an end-to-end encrypted

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,320
manner where

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,680
there's both authenticated and also

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
encrypted traffic between it

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
alice will then continue to ask r2 to

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,480
extend

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,360
what we call the circuit over to r3

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,720
and finally she will tell r3 to connect

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,760
to bob

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,760
she now has an encrypted connection from

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,959
herself to r1 via r1 and encrypted

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,680
session to r2

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,440
and via r2 and encrypted session to r3

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,720
and now she can finally establish

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,200
the tcp connection to bob if we take a

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,040
bit of a look at how this works from the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
different adversary scenarios we can

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,000
think of bob will be able to see that

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,000
there's traffic coming from r3 how much

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,160
traffic that's flowing and so on

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
r3 will be able to see that there's

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,399
traffic coming from r2

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
r2 will be able to see how much traffic

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,040
that is coming from r1 and r1

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
will know um that there is traffic

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,120
coming from alice and that is connecting

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,440
to r2 but what is important here is that

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,240
we can see that only r3 knows about

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
bob r2 and r1 does not know about bob

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
which is the endpoint that alice is

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,839
trying to connect to

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
this means that the multiple hops on

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
this system

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,680
here that they will have to cooperate

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,240
to be able to betray alice and

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,120
that should give us both some anonymity

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
properties

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,959
but also some more security against

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,760
various other observation techniques

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,000
that can happen

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
it's important in this whole thing to

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,279
understand that the anonymity properties

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
doesn't just come from

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480
encryption we have to have this

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,120
multi-hop system

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,480
to gain the anonymity properties if we

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,959
take an example where we have

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,639
alice and bob having a direct connection

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,720
which is enter and encrypted over for

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
example the tls protocol

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,880
what happens here is that the encryption

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,279
protects the content usually we combine

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,120
encryption with authentication so that

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
an adversary cannot actively go in and

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
modify the traffic

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
but if we have an adversary that is

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,279
eavesdropping on the traffic between

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,600
alice and bob

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,440
like in this case what they would see is

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
basically gibberish

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
but one thing they will see that is

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,360
important to understand is that they

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,279
see that there is traffic flowing

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,959
between alice and bob

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
and additionally they get they get

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,360
information such as

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,519
uh when did the session begin when did

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
this session end how much data was

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,040
transferred how much data was received

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,240
from both ends

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
which tcp ports are they using to

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
connect to

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,000
and so on this data is what we call

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
metadata and it's metadata that we try

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,160
to protect

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,600
in detroit network so that you cannot

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,160
collect metadata from

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
the users that are part of it and one of

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,720
the reasons we do this

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,639
is because of this guy this is michael

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
hayden he's the former director of the

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,320
nsa and the cia

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
and he very openly in an interview a

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
couple of years ago

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,120
said that the u.s state kills people

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,880
based on

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,800
metadata one part we won't be talking

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,720
that much about in this presentation is

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,079
our bridge system but it still deserves

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,839
a bit of a mention

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,519
since some of the tour users are in

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
centered areas and because the toy

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,079
network is an open and public network

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
as i described earlier when alice is

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,480
establishing the connection through the

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,399
network

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,720
she knows every single note that is in

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,720
the network that means that it's trivial

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
for an adversary who wants to block

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,399
access to the tor network

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,760
to simply fetch a list of all the nodes

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,519
in the network and then block

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,440
all the ip addresses and this is

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,720
something we do see happen

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
what we have done then is that we've

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,880
built an abstraction on top of this that

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,279
we call the bridge system

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,079
in parallel to the tor network there is

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,880
a more

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,760
closed it's a hidden network sort of to

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,199
say

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,519
which is used to contain tor relays

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,399
that are used as entry points into the

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
tor network

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,560
but since these nodes are not listed in

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,279
the directory documents

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,199
they are not as easy to censor we then

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,519
have various software to distribute it

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,880
out to the users this could be via email

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,560
it can be via

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,880
various web services that we have

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,040
different system for accessing even in

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,360
in central areas if we

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,959
if we take a look at how it works one

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
thing here is that we have alice who's

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,920
in a centered area

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
alice is trying to connect to a bridge

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,800
over the tour protocol

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519
one issue that could be here is that the

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,120
attacker is able to identify at the edge

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,639
between the centered area

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
and to the bridge that alice is

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,720
communicating over the tor protocol

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,399
this means that if you do dpi and so on

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,399
and you're able to say given this

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,120
connection this is probably

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,000
a torque connection then alice is mo

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
will most likely have

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
her access to the bridge blocked and

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,680
eventually the bridge will be

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,959
blocked entirely for other uses as well

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,920
to deal with this issue we came up with

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,959
a system called

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,519
pluggable transports these is again

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,040
a small abstraction where you can have

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,079
your tor client

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,560
use a plugable transport client

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,399
to connect to a blockable transport

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,600
server which is then connected to

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,040
an actual tor daemon which is giving

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
access to the network

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,800
but using this pt system you have you're

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,639
able to use an

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,480
obfuscated protocol instead of using

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,199
just the tor protocol itself

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
these have a number of pretty nice

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,560
properties

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,279
it allows people to build an experiment

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,320
and deploy

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,120
these obfuscation technologies without

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,160
having to modify tor itself tori is a

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,120
c codebase it's pretty complicated

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,480
it requires a bit of time for us to do

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,839
code review and so on

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
so having a faster paced environment to

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,720
build an experiment with this

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
anti-censorship technology is pretty

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,920
critical

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
and the pluggable transports helps with

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
that

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
a cool thing about it is that it's an

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
open system

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
we have a specification for it we work

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,279
with other vendors on it

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
and there are different vpn providers

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,880
and so on that also supports using

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,839
pluggable transport together with their

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,839
systems

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,160
it's important for this pluggable

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,520
transport system to have a diverse set

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,360
of tools that works with it and that we

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,120
can use in different scenarios for

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,000
example it might be that one of them has

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,520
a weakness

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
then it's important that we have other

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
tools that works for different kind of

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
people

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,679
or in different scenarios one of them

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
that we haven't used right now is called

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,240
the obfuscator or ops4

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,280
what it does is that it makes it more

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,400
difficult for

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,840
passive dpi to verify the presence of

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
the ops 4 protocol

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,840
as mentioned in one of the previous

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,640
slides around bridges it's possible for

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,440
an adversary to see that a given

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,840
connection

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
is a torque connection and thus shut it

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,000
down

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,919
another thing an adversary could do

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,080
would be to try to connect to what it

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,600
thinks is a tor relay and try to speak a

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,160
bit of the tor protocol

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,000
if the bridge responds with something

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,039
that is the tour protocol it knows that

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,600
this is a

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,520
torque connection ops 4 protects against

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,160
this by having a shared secret between

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
the

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,760
the client and the user that the

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,919
adversary has to know as well

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,120
this makes active probe being very

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
difficult

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,799
it uses some encryption it uses the

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,440
entour handshake from tor which is an

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,520
x25519 based

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
handshake but it does some tricks to

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
make the

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,799
elliptic curve points indistinguishable

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,559
from uniform random strings

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,200
additionally we have a system called

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,760
meek meek is using what is called domain

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
fronting via http domain fronting is

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,080
very basically

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,320
where the client makes a connection into

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,679
one of the big public

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,200
cloud system in this example it uses

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,240
azure what it does is that it

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,840
seems to be connecting to a site that

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,799
essentially would have no interest in

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,000
blocking such

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,200
as a big cdn site for some javascript

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,960
code for example what it does is that a

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,360
an adversary monitoring alice will see

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,400
that alice is doing a dns lookup for

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,480
ajax asp.netcdn.com

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
and immediately after she receives the

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,720
response she's making a tls

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,640
connection into this cloud and in the

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,160
sni header of the tls connection

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,280
she requests ajax asp.net cdn.com

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,480
but inside of the http

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,799
header she will request a different host

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
and many of these public clouds have

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,160
different load balancers

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,120
at the edge and they will happily send

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,240
you over to

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,360
a different customer in the system where

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,200
we are operating

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,679
a bridge for to access the toy network

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
this is a very nice system it's a bit

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,840
expensive

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
because we have to pay for all the

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,440
traffic in and out of the clouds

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
and additionally some of the cloud

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,559
providers really don't like us

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,400
that we're we're doing this kind of

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,480
stuff so to

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,520
try to mitigate that a bit we've built a

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,840
system that uses

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,240
less traffic it's called snowflake the

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,960
way snowflake works is that we have a

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,559
snowflake broker which is

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,880
also in a public cloud but is used for

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,679
alice alice connects to the snowflake

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
broker

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,880
also using um

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,120
this sni trick and with domain fronting

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,120
but in this time she doesn't have to

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,360
send all her traffic via the

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,520
public cloud what she instead uses the

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,960
broker for is to

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,000
find a webrtc client out on the

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,480
internet ip space that is uncensured

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
alice is now able to make an webrtc

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
connection between herself in the

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,240
centered area

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,799
and this client which is running in some

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
person's

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,000
web browser as a web extension out on

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,640
the internet

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,600
and using this web browser as sort of a

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,760
bouncing point

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,640
she's able to establish a connection to

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,600
a snowflake pt server over a websocket

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
connection

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,880
this has the benefit that we're

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
exchanging very little traffic over the

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,960
cloud provider

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,000
and the game we are playing here is that

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
we hope that the

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
adversaries is not interested in

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,960
blocking the entire ip space where

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,720
people are

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,799
usually having their laptops and their

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
phones and thus where these snowflake

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,120
clients

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,320
exist we're finally at the point where

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,039
we can start talking about

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,120
the torn network as mentioned earlier

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,520
it's an open network it means that every

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,360
everybody can join it and the only thing

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,919
you need access to is that you need a

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,320
pretty stable internet connection and

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,440
ideally in some data center where you

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,520
can run

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,799
a an operating system with the tor

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,840
software on

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,280
we have something between 6000 and 7000

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
nodes in the network

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,039
all of these nodes are provided by

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,600
different individuals some are provided

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,960
by companies who support the tour course

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,240
or also different nonprofit

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,679
organizations that set up

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,520
set up these organizations in their

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,760
respective countries where they can get

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,159
legal advice and so on

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,600
an important thing from the security of

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
the tour system is that we have a

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,159
diverse set

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,320
of these nodes called the directory

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
authorities we have nine directory

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,480
authorities and then we have a special

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,360
directory

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,720
authority which is purely focused on the

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,120
bridge system

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,080
the directory authority's responsibility

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,200
and

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,039
abilities is that they are able to

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
decide which nodes

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
are in the tor network and which nodes

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
are going to be kicked out if for

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,400
example we detect that they are

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,159
doing something to the traffic they're

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,799
monitoring it they're modifying traffic

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,480
and so on

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,919
georg is going to talk a bit more about

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,360
that later

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,200
um these nodes are critical to the

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,520
security of the system and

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,280
they are run by trusted individuals that

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
have been in the torque community for a

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,679
long time

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
they are hosted in different parts of

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,000
the world we have some in europe

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,880
we even have one in sweden we have some

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,080
in the u.s

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,520
and so on the security of the majority

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,240
of these nodes are

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,600
pretty important to uphold and the

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,640
safety of this system

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,960
very much depends on these nodes being

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,960
safe

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,280
if we take a bit of a look at the amount

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,080
of bandwidth that exist in this network

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
we have

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,120
two different things we have to look at

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,799
we have we

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,360
the advertised bandwidth and we have

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:20,480
what is called the bandwidth history

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,880
the advertised bandwidth is the sum of

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,760
how much bandwidth each relay think it

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
has

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,080
and the bandwidth history is how much

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,320
traffic that has been flowing through

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,120
the the network if we take a look at the

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,880
chart here we can see that the traffic

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,320
is generally growing

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,840
we have around somewhere between 500 and

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,000
600 gigabits

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,960
of traffic available in detroit network

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,960
right now

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,799
and we're utilizing somewhere between

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:55,039
200 and 300 gigabits if you look

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,120
at the top curve between 2019 and 2020

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,760
you will see there is a pretty steep

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,039
uh spike in there this was some

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,919
researchers who was doing

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,520
an experiment to see how much traffic is

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,960
actually available in the network where

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
they were trying to push some of the

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
relays to their limits

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,480
so that they were able to see how much

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
traffic that are actually available in

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
it

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,000
and we can see that we're slowly getting

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,200
towards that step

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
if we look at the total number of relays

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,200
and also the total number of bridges in

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,360
the network we can see that we have

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
somewhere between 6000 and 7000 as

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,600
mentioned earlier before

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
it's pretty stable right now we're not

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,520
getting that many more

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,840
um the amount of bridges also seems to

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,159
be pretty stable

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,039
and fortunately it seems like they're

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,480
growing in capacity in terms of network

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,480
but if you're interested in running a

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,120
relay we of course always interested to

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,080
getting more relays

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,799
it's important to understand that the

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,799
safety

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,320
of the tor network comes from its

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,840
diversity

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
one of the things is the diversity of

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,240
the relays the more relays we have

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,000
the more diverse they are the fewer

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,960
attackers in a position to do traffic

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,600
confirmation

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,320
and diversity here means everything from

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
which

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
person is running it which country they

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,760
are which airs number

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,919
they're in which operating system

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,440
they're on even down to which point

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,559
release of the tor release they are

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
running

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,400
it's also important for the toy network

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,480
that we have diversity of the users and

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
reasons and different reasons to use it

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
gear is going to return to that later

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
when he talks a bit about the

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,559
applications of tor

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
but one example here is that we have 50

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,799
000 users in for example iran

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,880
it means that almost all of them are

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,200
normal citizen and most likely not bots

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,400
or

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,799
anything like that one problem we do

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,559
have

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,400
is that we have an open research problem

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:49,360
with is how do we measure

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,360
this diversity in the network over time

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,080
one example of a place where we are not

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,640
doing so well on diversity

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,679
is the relay platforms this is something

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
we store

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,840
in our metric system so we have data

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,000
about it historically

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
if we take a bit of a look at the plot

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
here you will see that we have around

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,360
6000 nodes which is running on the linux

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,760
system

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,600
historically there has been a bit of a

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,400
connection between the debian project

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,559
and tor

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,480
so we believe that a large fraction of

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,960
these linux nodes are

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,760
running either debian or ubuntu or some

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,880
other debian based

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,320
distribution one interesting thing we

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,919
can say

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,480
about this plot additionally is that if

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,919
we look around the change from

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,679
2015 to 16

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,200
is that the bsd relays are slowly taking

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,840
over the number of

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,080
windows relays we are generally not an

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,120
organization that are very good with

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,919
windows on the server side of things so

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,159
that is definitely lagging behind also

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,240
some parts of it is our own fault

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,080
but it's really good to see that the bsd

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,200
community is also picking up

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,159
on on tour in general and are helping to

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,720
provide

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,480
a tour relay hosting

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,080
another place where the diversity could

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,120
be better into our network

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,600
is the number of countries that we're in

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,960
and how big the clusters are in the

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,279
respective countries

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
if we take a look at this top 10 list of

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
where which countries that have the most

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,200
relays

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:30,240
we can see that germany have 1500

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,159
the us have 1100 friends have almost 700

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,360
relays in their countries which means

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,919
that it's

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,960
it's very much centralized around some a

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
very few number

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,760
of of countries i thought it was a bit

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,919
interesting to see sweden was

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,520
in the top 10 here i think that's really

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,960
awesome even though this is a virtual

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,399
conference i thought it would be fun to

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
sort of highlight

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,440
sweden together with norway and denmark

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
in this case

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,360
where sweden is doing vastly better than

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,080
norway and and much better than

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,279
denmark i think if i remember correctly

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,559
then finland is

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,320
number 11 on on this list if we

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,360
if we had that included if we tried to

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,640
to plot this on a world map you can see

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,760
how it looks here it's

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,120
very much centralized around the us and

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,320
central europe this charge doesn't say

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,000
that much because it's so

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,919
centralized but if we remove the top

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,120
three that is

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,720
germany and the us and france it will

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,880
instead look like this

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,000
you can see that there are areas of the

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,960
world where we

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
generally don't have many relays running

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,559
we don't have

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,679
nodes running in a large part of the

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
african continent

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,399
there are parts of latin america where

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,360
we are not running relays antarctica of

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,320
course

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
greenland as well

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,360
we are the relays are generally placed

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,600
in areas where

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,880
there is the least chance of course of

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
them getting blocked

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,080
so it doesn't make sense for example to

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,840
run a relay in iran

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,200
when there is already censorship going

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
on in in this country

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,679
if we if we take a look at the

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,279
networks therein if you remember back at

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,520
one of the earlier slides where i was

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,039
talking about how alice decides which

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,480
path through the network that she's

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,520
going to pick

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,880
amongst these three nodes this algorithm

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,559
for path selection

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,399
has a number of settings that you can

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,120
tune for example you're able to say i

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,039
want to have

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,480
a path where i exit in russia or where i

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,159
exit in germany

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,240
this can be useful if you're using the

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,640
tor network to for example test if a

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,240
website works probably from germany or

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
from russia from some other place in the

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,919
world

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,760
by default one of the properties that

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,960
the default path selection have

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,840
in tor is that it refuses to add two

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,640
nodes

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,360
to the same path which is within the

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,720
same

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,399
16 network of the ipv4 address space

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,480
so if we try to group the number of

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,200
relays we have per

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,720
16 on the ip space we can see that there

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,559
is a number of them that have a very

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,159
large number of relays as well

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,000
but it's still better than at the

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,000
country level we can for example see at

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,080
185.220

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,559
16 that we have 216 relays in that

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,559
network

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,200
if we move on and look at the aes number

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,320
instead we can see that ovh in

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,600
france which is a a reasonably

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,120
cheap hosting provider where you can buy

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,080
both physical and

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,799
vps nodes have around 770 nodes in the

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,039
network

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,120
hetzner which is a big german also

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,679
pretty cheap provider

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,279
has 400 nodes in their network and so on

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,679
one thing that's interesting here is

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,200
that

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,960
some of the networks that exist operates

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,760
in with different um with different as

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,159
numbers

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,919
for example i believe that uh lenovo

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,600
ocean they are available in many zones

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,600
also outside of europe

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,360
and outside of the us so they have

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,279
different as numbers for these kind of

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,679
things

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,679
next up gear wants to talk a bit about

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,000
how we in the tour project handle

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,240
malicious relays in the toy network

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
as we've seen on the previous slides

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,519
having a low barrier for rendering the

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,679
tournament work is

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,760
great for diversity but on the other

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,840
hand it invites malicious

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,880
actors as well to join the tournament

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,960
book and

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,320
mess with users traffic or even the

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,559
anonymize them so

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,519
what are we doing and what are we

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:41,200
planning to do against those

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,640
i have um put two scenarios on the slide

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,399
which we are concerned with so the

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,039
scenario one is you have a malicious

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,200
operator

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,120
which is running a bunch of relays and

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,320
trying to get them both in the

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,880
guard and exit position and

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,519
essentially the anonymized users because

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,320
they know

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
where you are connecting from and then

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,760
they

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,960
they know where people are heading to

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,360
and they can easily

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
correlate those things at least in

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,679
theory

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,679
and try and try to um figure out

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,960
what you are up to so that's that's bad

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
news

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,399
to prevent this we try to pin guard

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
relays

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,240
that means once you start your

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,039
application towards picking

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,440
a set of guard relays and sticking to

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
them

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,120
for for a long time like weeks and

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,240
months making sure

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,559
that um the risk is

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,360
the risk that you are actually picking a

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,399
bad one and landing in this situation

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,720
um is pretty low

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,120
and on the other hand we try to convince

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,120
really operators that they should set

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,960
the so-called my family setting in their

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,440
tor configuration file

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,200
indicating that set of relays belonging

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,399
to the same family

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,279
which in turn allows tor to avoid

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,640
those relays being in the same path when

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,600
it was selecting

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,720
the path through the network but that's

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,720
just one scenario we're concerned with

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,000
a more likely scenario is that a

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,120
malicious actor is setting

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,200
up exit relays and trying to

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,880
snoop on users traffic or manipulate

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,840
even user traffic

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,919
for instance by rewriting bitcoin

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,120
addresses trying to steal bitcoin

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:29,360
so what are we doing against those

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,760
we have a set of tools um which is

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,960
which is scanning access relays

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,200
pretending to be

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,399
legitimate for instance two browser

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,519
users

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:43,600
and trying to attack attacks like uh as

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,559
stripper tags where attackers would um

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,039
strip off the sl protection and rewrite

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,679
the

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,039
points of the bitcoin address on an http

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,480
website

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,919
and then try to steal the money

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,240
this is working kind of it's pretty hard

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,640
to

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,880
write good scanners because as soon as

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,880
you

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,000
just scan for website x being modified

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,119
and the attacker is

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,159
modifying instead website y

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,200
your scanner is not detecting

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,200
this attack so given there are some

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,280
billion websites out there

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,399
it's pretty hard to scan for this

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,879
correctly and

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,960
find all those malicious as tripping

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,079
attacks

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,560
but if but once we find those um we

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
swiftly blacklist on those found relays

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,440
and and

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,200
the families behind this if there's a

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,280
family behind this but

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,200
there's a overall uphill battle so we

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
need uh desperately need to change the

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,960
arms race because we can't keep up with

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,480
that one

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,720
what can we do instead so

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,599
there are at least two areas we can

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,200
improve here

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,599
one is application level improvements

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,560
that means we configure for instance to

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,560
browser in a way

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,240
that is only requesting https protected

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,960
websites and it's preventing

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,720
downgrading to http only on http

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,200
websites

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,079
and there are two ways for this one one

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
way is to

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,200
use built-in functionality of https

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,560
everywhere an extension we already ship

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,880
into a browser

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,119
which can be configured to only allow

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,800
https requests

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:30,400
and the other one is recently

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,000
firefox guided feature called https only

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,599
mode

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,119
which mozilla is still testing and

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,079
refining and we could

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,400
backport a bunch of patches and ship

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,599
this

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,400
ship those into a browser which has the

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:49,119
benefit that the usability is

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,839
is better than in the https everywhere

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,400
case and

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,320
this is an important point you must not

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,680
forget because

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,000
there are likely still a ton of http

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,960
only

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,160
websites out there and there's a big

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,119
risk that

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,320
breakage for for users in in this

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,119
scenario

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,359
leads them to using a different browser

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,079
which is less secure and less safe

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,280
intro browser is essentially making it

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,280
worse for those users

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,240
but apart from those application level

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,720
improvements there's

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,280
the general idea of just limiting the

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,560
influence of of release we don't know

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,599
anything about when uh when tor's

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,640
picking a path

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,359
through the network what what no

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,960
here means is is to be decided but it

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:44,320
could be a thing like a web of trust

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,040
where some folks in the community know

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
those operators and can kind of watch

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,680
for them

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,839
and if if we know them

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,920
they get just more of the traffic than

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:03,119
they would get otherwise and we try to

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,160
decide what good thresholds you are

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,560
and where we should draw the line and

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,000
make the necessary changes and how they

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,480
would look like

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,320
overall in particular if there are

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,079
different goals to consider not just the

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,119
better really

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,280
protection but as well our scalability

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,560
and performance improvement plans

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,760
so there are some tradeoffs to make

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,160
we are currently in the process of um

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,520
of nailing down the plan and then think

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,800
about

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,040
prototyping things to make

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,440
this arms race change in a way that we

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,440
can actually actually win it and not

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,520
just um

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,440
be able to uh to act after the fact

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,920
as we are doing now i think it's fair to

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,040
say

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,920
that most of our users come in contact

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,079
with

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,520
tor through one or the other

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,440
applications

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,599
in the first place but how do we

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,720
actually sell the different properties

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,280
to provides

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,280
to different user groups if you're

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,040
talking to private citizens

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,200
it's pretty easy to say hey you should

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,320
use tor because tor

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,079
provides privacy on the internet

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,400
to help safeguarding your privacy on the

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,440
internet but that might not be as

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,640
appealing

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,560
to say human rights activists

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,800
who might mainly be motivated to

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,640
reach websites they care about like

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,920
facebook or news websites like the

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,359
guardian on bbc

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,960
to inform themselves about things

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,280
happening in their home country where

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,960
they are censored

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,400
if you're talking to businesses on the

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,560
other hand then

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,800
they might not really care about privacy

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,680
on the internet or with ability even

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,680
even though they should but they are

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,200
much more interested in

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,320
tour helping them with their network

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,520
security

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,320
to keep their assets safe

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,119
if you're talking to governments they

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,280
are foremost

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,359
interested in what is called traffic and

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,440
asset resistance

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,240
which given their opponents like nation

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,200
states

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,839
and the resources they have is quite a

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,200
reasonable

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,000
goal so

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,839
having all those different user groups

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,280
why do we actually care

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,560
that all of them are port are part of

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,720
the tour network

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,079
what is actually the goal behind that

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,040
there are a bunch of reasons why you

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,480
want to have a lot of diverse

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,800
users on the tour network first one is

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,800
that

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,599
having a diverse user group is helping

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,599
against singling out individual users

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
you can think of it that way if you

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,280
already know

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,880
that only government officials are using

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,440
the two network

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,240
you already have narrowed down the

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,560
potential

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,599
user you are looking for considerably

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,000
compared to millions of users with

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,440
different

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,319
backgrounds being in different countries

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
being online at different times and so

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,440
on

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:25,040
but there's a tension here right because

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,119
all those different uses we want to have

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,290
connect to the tour network with their

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,480
own devices

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,680
[Music]

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,000
and their own operating systems which

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,800
nowadays at least leak a ton of

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,079
information

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,960
in particular if they are using

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,960
a complicated tool like a browser

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,680
how do we how do we prevent

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,520
users from getting singled out that way

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,440
um so we have developed in the past and

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,359
still developing

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,560
an own browser which is called tour

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,160
browser

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:10,640
which is helping against

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,400
that problem so

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,760
there are different strategies we could

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,640
do here

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,839
one of the strategies is which we

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,200
actually do

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:24,960
is trying to make uses

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,520
of tor browser as uniform as possible

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
that means

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,599
why we still try to provide the best

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,040
browsing experience as other browsers do

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,480
as well

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,240
we go at great length and

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,160
trying to make users uniform for

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,200
instance

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,200
we try to avoid

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,720
things like leaking your screen

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,220
resolution

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,350
or

00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,350
[Music]

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,000
users being tracked across websites with

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,359
cracking cookies

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,240
or leaking your language you have

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,040
pre-configured on your desktop or in

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,440
your tor browser and so on

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,359
so that's one way to deal with that

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,560
problem making users uniform

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,960
the other way is basically spoiling

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,960
fingerprinting efforts by just

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:27,200
returning random values or spoof values

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,640
making essentially

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,839
an unusable means of sending individual

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,920
users out

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,400
but it's a problem which is not only a

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,920
thing in the browser space

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:45,119
but generally an application layer issue

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:48,480
which one has to take to care about

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,000
but there's more i think we as well a

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,640
diverse set of users

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,880
with diverse backgrounds to get our

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,800
basic usability

00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,839
privacy and security properties right

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,400
if we optimize only for one user group

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,280
with one set of goals and one thread

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,200
model

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,119
there's the high risk that we endanger

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,720
other users and other user groups

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,160
because

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,280
they might interact with applications

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:23,359
like tool browser in a way

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,040
that is not taking into account when

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,720
redesigning it

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,760
so then they might make mistakes or just

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,800
use it use the application in a way

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,560
which was not in our mindset and

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,640
this is pretty dangerous

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,839
if you stick to the browser for a while

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,960
what we've been

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,960
doing in the past is doing trainings all

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,440
over the world we're still doing them

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,920
together all those different use cases

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,839
and goals and threat models out there

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,560
and feed them directly into the tool

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,560
browser development bank

00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,599
this has resulted in a significant

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,280
improvement

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,440
in usability

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,359
and thus privacy protections and

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,319
security guarantees

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,599
if you look at the screenshot i have put

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,599
on the slide

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,000
for instance as an example you see in

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,319
the upper right corner

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,280
two icons one is the shield icon which

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,839
is

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,640
showing you easily the securities level

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,839
you are on

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,200
and if you click on it it gives you

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,079
access to

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,960
choose a different one if you wish to do

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,079
so

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,960
and the broom icon is meant to give you

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:40,079
a new

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,079
clean tour session if if the need arises

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,520
and it's just one click away while it's

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,800
been previously buried

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:50,240
in some sub-menus which was clearly not

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,560
optimal and if you want to know

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,280
something about your contour usage you

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,560
can

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,200
easily click on the log icon and your

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,319
current tour circuit is shown and there

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,599
are ways to

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,520
request new ones if then if the need

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,560
should arise

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,880
but there are clearly downsides to

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,400
diversity as well which we should talk

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,400
about in this context too

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:22,400
so with users with diverse backgrounds

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,280
and different behaviors and during the

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,520
tournament work

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,480
you are eventually getting jerks on it

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,200
as well

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,319
this is hardly surprising right but the

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,960
consequences of that are pretty severe

00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,760
so how does this look like this looks

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,319
like

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,920
um users getting blocked from reaching

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,680
the destinations

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,200
points if you're using tor browser you

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,760
are not allowed to enter websites

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,880
anymore

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,359
or you're getting captures you have to

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,680
solve

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,920
and even that is not really helping

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,839
sometimes

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,839
this is problematic because

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,000
i mean if you are a normal user

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,079
prospective user or even a

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,440
normal toy user and you're trying to

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,680
enter

00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,760
the swedish railroad company's website

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,880
looking up timetables or buying tickets

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,880
and you're getting agreed with the

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,079
website i put on the slide saying hey

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,640
you're not allowed

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,359
because of your unauthorized behavior

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,480
then this is

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,800
in the first place ridiculous and then

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
highly confusing because i mean you you

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,760
just entered the

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,240
domain name and hit enter and that's it

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,800
there was no behavior

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,079
like doing real queries or messing with

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,359
the website or something like that

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,240
so what you probably think is oh this

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,280
tool thing is

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:42,720
is broken it's not really usable let's

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,960
do something else like firing up chrome

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,000
and moving on with our lives

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,720
which is understandable as i said um but

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,839
this is

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,720
problematic for at least two reasons

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,720
the first one is

00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,800
it weakens the overall guarantees

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,079
towards providing to all of its users

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,839
because

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,599
if you're jumping off the torchway in

00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,839
other uses as well then this weakens the

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,920
cover for the remaining ones

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,119
against getting singled out or

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,040
adversaries

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,440
and secondly it could even have

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,400
consequences for you personally

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,040
too depending on your depending on where

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,680
you're living

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,480
and the context you're living in because

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,160
if you are

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,319
picking up a tool which is less

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,920
sophisticated

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,520
in safeguarding your privacy and

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,920
security online

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,839
this course this could essentially

00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,440
endanger yourself

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:40,559
so we have to solve this problem somehow

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,880
and how we

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,119
do this we will extra mine on the next

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,240
slide

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,480
so how do we solve this two blocking

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,040
problem

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,119
um you may see all of those question

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,559
marks already on the slide right so this

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,880
should indicate that

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,559
we don't have the silver bullet inside

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,000
unfortunately

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,040
there are different tools we have in our

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,520
toolbox both been using

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,280
we have both been using them in the past

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,319
and the present and thinking about them

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,200
for the future um this might help

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,920
you see it's not sure yet so what i've

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,680
been doing

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,040
traditionally has been reaching out to

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,000
websites and

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,640
trying to convince them that tor uses

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,920
all wall a positive thing to have

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,960
which was kind of a mixed success

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,000
some website owners dropped tor

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,480
blocks some were not convinced and even

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
if they would have been there's the risk

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,280
that you

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,640
would just start seeing blocks again

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,839
like a week later when they changed

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,119
their mind

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,480
um and you would start from uh square

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,240
zero again

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,240
which is overall a thing which is not

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,720
scaling in particular if you look at the

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,400
billions of websites out there and uh

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,160
the constant monitoring you would have

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,000
to do and and

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,440
then contacting all the website owners

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,960
who are blocking tour

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,760
so this is really not a good solution

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,680
if it's a solution at all so we have to

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,079
do something about the core problem

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,680
that we have jerks on the torrent work

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,200
which is particularly hard

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:18,720
in the tour context because tor aims

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,400
to provide anonymity for for essentially

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,400
all of its users not just for the

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,680
non-jerk ones

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,960
and apart from the problem that

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,040
there is no clear definition of what is

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,520
a jerk and what not

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,079
so what can we do we have been thinking

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,359
about

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:41,760
um kind of proof of work schemes

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:44,000
solving small puzzles to um

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,520
to show that you spend some effort here

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,440
and

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,720
this could allow you accessing

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,280
onion services for instance or

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,960
other things this has been mainly

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,680
developed as a proposal

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,520
three two seven in the context of

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,839
solving the problem for

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,720
the night of service against our onion

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,280
services or

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,599
against onion services but it could have

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,720
in other parts as well

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,520
then a more sophisticated things could

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,200
include enormous credentials like

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,319
privacy pass

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,590
where we would issue tokens

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,480
to users and then those tokens can get

00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:27,200
[Music]

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,800
exchanged against access to services

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,880
later on

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:36,480
um another thing we recently

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,040
thought about was allowing paid access

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,839
relays

00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,839
where we would um

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,800
make sure that those exits or the

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,200
operators of those x's would make sure

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,119
that

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,000
the ip reputation would stay high

00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,000
which is usually

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,200
the indicator of getting blocked or not

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,359
blocked like low ipo reputation would

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,800
mean you're getting easier

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:07,839
blocked by by services than

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,359
having a high ip or rotation so paid

00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:13,200
exit

00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:16,079
operators would get get some kind of

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,280
payment and in return would make sure

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,720
that the

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
those axis released would

00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:27,599
be ones with higher reputation

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,200
and those less likely to get blocked um

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,800
those are the things we are currently

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,839
thinking about

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,319
as i said we'll see how how this goes

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,760
uh in the long run whether we deploy any

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,440
of that at all

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,440
or whether they are something that we

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,000
better be come up with it's it's a tough

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,920
problem

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,760
we have to solve we are slowly getting

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,000
to the end of this presentation

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,240
we are we hope that you have gotten an

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,720
idea about what tor is

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,240
why the different diversity properties

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,599
matter to the tourist system where we

00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,599
can do better

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,880
if you're sitting at home and is

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,240
thinking how can i

00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,680
help the tour project in various ways

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,760
we have a number of things you can do

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,359
for example you can if you're a software

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,040
person you can start hacking on some of

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,040
the cool projects we have

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,640
you can help us find and potentially

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,599
even fix some of the bugs that we have

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,440
in the software

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,640
the software we write is by no means

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,280
perfect

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,960
if you run tor on some interesting

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,160
platform that might not be

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,240
what we used normally then helping

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,920
testing tour on this platform would be

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,000
of great benefit to us

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,960
if you are more into research stuff you

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,559
can work on

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,800
some of the different open research

00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,839
projects that exist there is a pretty

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,240
big community

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,599
of privacy researchers that are

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,839
gathering together

00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,960
in some i think there are annual annual

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,440
meetings called

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,240
pets where there is a lot of papers

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,800
about

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,520
a tor presented you can if you have

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,240
access to

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,040
server hosting and bandwidth and a

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,839
server

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,960
that you can run a tour relay or a

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:01,599
bridge

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,800
and you can also go out and teach other

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,400
people about tour

00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,720
and privacy in general

00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,599
another important way that you can help

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,720
is to

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,800
donate to the tour project if you go to

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,800
donate donate.tourproject.org we're

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,040
running our end of the year campaign for

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,280
2020 right now we

00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,520
are very happy to receive the donations

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,319
donation money is excellent for us

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,880
because

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,480
the donation money that we get can be

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,440
spent on things that we think is

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,000
important

00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,200
a lot of the development we do is grant

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,680
based where we write

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,359
a proposal then we go through a number

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,880
of iteration of those and then we get a

00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,960
final approval and then we have a list

00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,280
of objectives that we have to go through

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,520
and do the development for that with

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,240
donation money we are able to look at

00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,319
things that

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,760
are for example an emergency situation

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,720
where we have a problem with the network

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,280
that we would like to do something about

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,359
and the donation money allows us to

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,160
spend developer hours on these things so

00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:03,680
please check out donate.tourproject.org

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,000
if you donate enough you will be able to

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,640
get a t-shirt or some other different

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
kind of

00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,599
tour branded swag

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,839
we're at the end of this presentation we

00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,839
hope you have enjoyed it

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,119
we do have time for a couple of

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,960
questions we believe

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:23,520
so let's have a look at those

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,240
i will yes so shifting over to the

00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,200
questions

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,160
thank you for the talk um i will

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,480
actually take this

00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,200
chance to change the view here so that

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,319
we can see both yoga and and alex

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,720
uh but yeah take it away okay so let's

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,680
begin there's plenty of questions so i

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,680
better stop talking

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,680
does tour work better the more people

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,640
are using it

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,280
uh kind of like burying the important

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,599
traffic

00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,599
in unimportant

00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,799
do you want to go with that one gig yeah

00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,839
i can do actually

00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:03,280
so um i think

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,480
the answer is yes so the idea behind

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,040
drawers as

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,880
we've seen in the talk that we try to

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,680
blend in as many different

00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,319
backgrounds and different uses we have

00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,040
so

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,520
that is harder for people to anonymize

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,720
users

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,440
and and yes the scale is an important

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,720
factor here so if millions of users

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,559
are using tor instead of just 100 then

00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,319
the properties you get the anonymity

00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:32,160
properties you get are

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:35,839
are much better leaving all the other

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,839
things unchanged

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,760
so i think that's that's it for my side

00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:48,000
at least

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:51,040
that was good

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,040
you're muted henrik

00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:57,839
this is not the first time

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,280
this is the only it's the only way to

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,000
use the network

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,119
this one browser or are there more

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,599
applications

00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,599
like secure chat come to mind

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,720
i i can take this um the

00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,319
primary product that we develop is the

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,240
tor browser it

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,680
it uses the little torque process to

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,119
connect to the network

00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,720
but we are starting to see other

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,480
organizations or other individuals

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,280
building different applications together

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,920
with tor

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,040
we have michael lee's onion share which

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,640
is a

00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,559
i think it started out just being a file

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:34,079
sharing tool that you could use

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,400
to share files easily in a secure way

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,000
also for people who are behind nat

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,160
networks

00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,760
and in combination with the toy browser

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,920
we also have people working on

00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,520
secure instant messaging we have some

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,400
people working on a new version of the

00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,720
ricochet

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,040
platform that we will hopefully see some

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:59,119
more of in the future

00:56:51,040 --> 00:57:03,359
want to add something here no it's cool

00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,359
okay uh this time um

00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,760
i seem to have very little knowledge

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,799
about tor so here comes another question

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,839
i heard that there are dot onion domains

00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,839
how are those different

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,359
should i start with this um we um the

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,640
way onion

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,720
domains work is that you get this very

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,000
long sort of random looking string and

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,079
then dot onion

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,079
what this long random string is is that

00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,319
it's actually a public key

00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,240
so it's a special kind of address

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,559
instead of seeing it as a host name

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,440
you should think of it as an ip address

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,240
which is represented by a 256 bit public

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,920
key

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,359
so you have authentication with who you

00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,280
are communicating with when you are

00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:51,040
making the connection

00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,200
the onion system doesn't rely on the

00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,359
exit nodes that is the final nodes that

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,400
is in the circuits that you create over

00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,480
detroit network

00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,839
which means that these services stay

00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,760
within the network

00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,359
so you can see it as there are anonymous

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,119
services that doesn't use

00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,040
this pretty scarce resource that we have

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,559
which is the exit nodes

00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,160
and you can then build application on

00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,680
top of that the

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,200
ricochet application that i just

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,839
mentioned and also onion share for that

00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,240
matter

00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,280
uses this uh these onion domains for for

00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,119
their file sharing

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,839
uh properties wanna add something

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,839
no it's fine

00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,400
should i combine the tor browser with

00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,839
plugins like

00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,400
ublock origin private badger

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,440
etc i seem to remember having seen

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,799
recommendations

00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:42,319
both for and against

00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:46,319
i guess i picked that one up

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,720
so what we are recommending is not to do

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,760
so

00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:53,440
so just take tor browser as it is

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,280
the reason for that is that it's easily

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,319
conceivable that

00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,040
adding um

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,280
adding different extensions like

00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:07,440
ublocker written or privacy badger

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,359
is measurable by network of servers

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,200
like they change traffic for instance

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,520
ubric originating is blocking a lot of

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,720
stuff

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,520
if it's working properly so this looks

00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,799
differently

00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,640
if you visit a website then using a

00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:23,359
normal tool browser

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,079
as we ship it as store project tips it

00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,559
so and this

00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,319
there's a risk that this makes you like

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,520
outstanding of of the group

00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:34,640
and makes you easier to identify

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:38,559
on the other hand i mean there are ideas

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:41,680
um improving toe browser's performance

00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,319
by shipping an ad blocker or a blogger

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,680
like uber

00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:47,680
origin because um that way

00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,960
a lot of crap is not loaded into browser

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,920
anymore meaning

00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,799
um sites load faster and this kind of

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,599
stuff

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,119
so there are definitely ideas using this

00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,640
kind of

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:02,000
ad blocker or even the the firefox

01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,319
built-in

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,880
tracking protection mechanism for

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,799
improving the overall performance

01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,920
but right now it's not really

01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:15,839
recommended

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,839
to add those extra extensions

01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,960
okay can using tor make you become a law

01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,520
enforcement target

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,839
example law enforcement agency might

01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,839
think that user x has something to hide

01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,440
i i can start with this one um so

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,799
this comes down to a little bit the

01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,319
thing we were talking about that we need

01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,480
diversity in the network

01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,400
that we need to have users using it not

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,839
just when they need to be anonymous but

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,640
also use it for their

01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:50,079
everyday tasks such as social media

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,040
reading news

01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,799
doing all these kind of things of course

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,640
if

01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,319
let's say you're trying to do something

01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,640
unlawful or something like that

01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:02,720
in the in your country and you're the

01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,960
only toy user there and you write

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,799
uh to your local pizza place that he's

01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,040
an idiot or something like that

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,640
um then it would be pretty clear that

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,480
you're the only one using joy in that

01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,839
area right so you will stand out

01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,440
but this is where it's so important that

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,760
we get more and more people to use it

01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,400
for

01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,880
the everyday tasks to avoid that kind of

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,880
scenario

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,880
yeah i mean just to add two sentences to

01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,520
this one

01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,480
um thor's not trying to hide that you're

01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,760
using tor

01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,200
right i mean there is um it's not the

01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,599
the idea is not to make it hard that

01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,000
trying to hide that you're using tor so

01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,799
yes i mean you're kind of outstanding

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,680
in a way that folks can easily see hey

01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,640
this one is

01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,280
this fellow is using tor that's

01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,040
everything

01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,680
always to keep in mind um but on the

01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,520
other hand as alex said

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,359
it's important to get um there's a set

01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,319
of users that this is not really a

01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,839
problem anymore

01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:01,359
and then i i think if you look around

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,520
most of the time it's not really a

01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,640
problem i mean you have probably heard

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,440
stories in the news that um that folks

01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,799
got really

01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,359
um like um tracked down because of their

01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:15,599
toy usage but then they were just only

01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:18,480
like one tour user in a certain setting

01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,640
and it was pretty easy to see hey

01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,480
this this crime got committed over tor

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,880
and there was just one toy user at that

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,640
time

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:30,319
um here so that's probably it

01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,839
so yeah there were set of users and many

01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,839
users and this shouldn't actually be a

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,839
problem

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,280
could outreach to avoid blocking be made

01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,480
more feasible

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,200
by communicating with cloud cdm

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,960
providers

01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,920
you mentioned some of them don't like

01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,319
tor why not

01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,839
i think it was in my slide that i said

01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:57,920
that

01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,680
that they don't like tort that was uh

01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,530
specifically around this domain fronting

01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,640
trick we do

01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:04,880
[Music]

01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,839
i think a lot of the companies that

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,880
provide

01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,799
web application firewalls such as what

01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,160
cloudflare provides and also many of the

01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:15,119
ctn providers

01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,960
have a have settings to disable toy

01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,839
users which we think is unfortunate

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,240
because

01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,440
um we believe that not uh there's not

01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,720
that much abuse

01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,960
that should be coming out of it and you

01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,760
end up blocking for real users who are

01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,559
just using it

01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,359
to to use sites we also think the

01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,000
blocking

01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,640
of tor people by default toy users by

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,240
default

01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,680
is a bit of an unfortunate thing and

01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,440
it's

01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,680
they should be able to technically build

01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,839
better solutions for example if you

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,440
on a web block let's say it gets a lot

01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,039
of abuse from tour users

01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,520
one natural thing there could be to save

01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,599
then we just block all toy users

01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,760
but then you let out also the users who

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,440
are not doing any kind of abuse

01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,880
so instead one thing you could be doing

01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,480
is that you could have that

01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,400
every user should be able to read your

01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,559
site but it might be they have to

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,079
sell their capture or do something else

01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,680
when they want to comment on it or

01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,720
register with an email address that

01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,000
works and so on

01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,839
there are various ways where you can

01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,760
sort of tune these parameters for

01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,280
for how much safety it is and we think

01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,400
of course it's unfortunate that you end

01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,400
up disabling by default

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,319
um to add to that um we are actually

01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,119
talking to

01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,160
uh to cdns for instance we are in close

01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:27,200
contact with

01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:29,520
cloudflare um because cloudflare is um

01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,200
seeing so much of the internet traffic

01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,039
and uh

01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,400
what happened in the past was that you

01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,880
got a lot of captures

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,720
because suddenly all all folks got

01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,920
subscribed to clutter and

01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,280
there's an option um enable tour

01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,559
and it's it's an option to

01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:51,599
um yeah to make sure that

01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,960
you're not attacked by folks coming from

01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,119
the tournament work and

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,720
and of course i mean if you are

01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,559
subscribing to clubfair

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,160
and you want to get the full benefit of

01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,319
uh securing against

01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,400
as many threads as possible you are

01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,480
checking the checkbox right

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,319
so what happened was a lot of our users

01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,559
were seeing captures and

01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:11,599
and it did cost us thousands of users

01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,559
because

01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,920
um normal users are not um seeing so

01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,920
frequent captures as

01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,200
they were seeing with tor browser and

01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,880
they were basically

01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,280
saying hey your top browser has broken

01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,680
it i got hacked what what's this crap

01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,599
and they

01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,599
and they were choosing something else so

01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:30,480
we saw this in in the downloads and

01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,559
uses user statistics and we got in

01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,079
contact with gloveflare and

01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:38,079
um they they

01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,240
why they didn't really fix their setup

01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,920
um let me put it that way they worked

01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,680
around it in a way that they treating

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,880
tor browsers especially

01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,880
and now um you're almost seeing no

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,160
no captures anymore but there's

01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,160
obviously there are more

01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,760
cdm providers like akamai and so on um

01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,760
yes talking to them is definitely a

01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,240
thing we should do and we are doing

01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,520
but it's often often it's the case that

01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,720
you're not important enough

01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:08,000
we don't have the right contacts

01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:11,359
to to make really a big change here

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,359
cloudflare being the exception

01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:21,200
what tour alternatives are there and

01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,200
how do they differ from thor

01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,880
oh there is um i personally don't know

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,480
very much about the alternatives i know

01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,280
there is i2p

01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,520
one of the things as far as i understand

01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,839
tor is stream oriented we work with data

01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,680
streams right now we only work with tcp

01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,359
we hope to be able to do udp and some

01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,799
kind of the same way

01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:45,200
that nat routers sees udp

01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,280
packets as sort of a kind of stream as

01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,240
soon as there is a response to it

01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,000
we hope to add that in the future um ihp

01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,799
is more packet oriented as far as i

01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,480
understand

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,400
and they have a big focus they have a

01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,960
lot of uses on

01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,079
i think doing also file sharing and

01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,400
generally staying more

01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,119
inside the network there's also been

01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,280
with the

01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,720
rise of cryptocurrencies there's been a

01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,839
lot of focus on

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,799
mix networks which was sort of what was

01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:13,440
there before

01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,720
tour happened and that has gotten an

01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,440
intention again now

01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,319
for uh doing anonymous transactions but

01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,520
they are more

01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:25,119
high latency um whereas tor tries to be

01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,720
some fairly low latency

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,240
yeah i think we should be fair and

01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,720
mentioned like

01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,280
at least privacy focused vpns as well

01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,000
yeah

01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,599
that they uh try to provide um

01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,799
censorship convention

01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,880
or even privacy protections by saying

01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:43,119
hey we don't like your traffic

01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,880
um and we don't collaborate with the law

01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,400
enforcement agencies or our secret

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,400
services

01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,079
but as we've seen on the slide i mean

01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,720
they are basically a single point of

01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,280
failure

01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,200
right i mean you could just easily snoop

01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,359
in front of the vpn

01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,359
server and behind it and then you can

01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:02,400
correlate the traffic at least or

01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,680
outright compromise the vpn server and

01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,839
then

01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,680
your your privacy anonymity is gone

01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,280
which is why you have the

01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,640
the multi-hop system that toys but but

01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,039
still i mean there are there are good

01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,920
guys in the vpn business it's not that

01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,239
that all of those are trying to make um

01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,279
cheap

01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:23,199
cheap buck out of your traffic or even

01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,960
try to to correlate your traffic and set

01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,819
it to a third parties

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,199
um so but still i mean

01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:31,520
[Music]

01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:33,199
those are single point of failures and

01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,480
and we and we think that

01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:39,520
that's the thing we don't want and we

01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:42,080
can we can do better here

01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,880
okay about fingerprinting uh what is the

01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,199
benefit of

01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:50,880
randomizing spoofing versus sending

01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:53,839
some data for all users

01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,839
hmm

01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,279
i'm not sure i got the question here um

01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,560
that's probably related to my to my

01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,359
slide that there are different

01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,799
techniques

01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,920
trying to uh to combat fingerprinting

01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:13,359
um there are there are ways um

01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,159
where you can send um basically fake

01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,359
data

01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:18,560
to uh to fingerprinting fingerprinting

01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,560
scripts

01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,279
and we kind of do this firefox um

01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,560
recently implemented a thing where you

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:29,600
um where you

01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,560
send the kind of a poison pill to a to

01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,520
fingerprinters

01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,719
making their fingerprinting technique

01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,480
essentially

01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:41,520
useless at least that's the goal

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,560
so we we try to make

01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,839
users as uniform as possible as the the

01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,960
first to go

01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:52,799
away because that's usually

01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,320
easier is costing less resources

01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,320
and there's no risk that the

01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,080
that the fingerprinter is trying to

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,640
reverse your spoofing and or your fear

01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,239
of sending fake data because maybe your

01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,679
algorithm is not good enough and they

01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:10,320
can just revert it and get

01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,440
the actual actual data or this kind of

01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,360
stuff so

01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:16,640
i think we are on the safe side if we

01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:19,760
try to make use as uniform as possible

01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,320
and often if you if you try to send fake

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,000
data

01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,520
there's the risk that is getting

01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,239
computation intensive

01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,239
especially in in critical path

01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,480
in the critical path where latency is

01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,120
mattering

01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,880
like rendering a web page or so if if

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,840
yours if your algorithm has

01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,520
suddenly to compute a ton of stuff just

01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:45,600
to to emit the

01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,719
fake data then it might be visible

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,760
on the website but but still there are

01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,320
research papers

01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,199
which try to to show that it's at least

01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,760
feasible

01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,560
to think about sending fake data for

01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,560
particular

01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,920
fingerprinting vectors so that's a

01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,960
concept which which needs to be explored

01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,960
but but still at the moment we think

01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,320
for most of the fingerprinting vectors

01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,600
it's better to

01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:16,080
try to not prove the day um

01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,920
the fingerprinting parts and make users

01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,960
uniform put them in different buckets

01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,400
and make sure that

01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:25,440
those buckets have enough users so that

01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,560
single ones can't get singled out a

01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,120
thing we recently

01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,239
added in one of the tour releases not in

01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,360
the browser

01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:35,280
is a protection mechanism called wtf it

01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,560
stands for web traffic fingerprinting

01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,600
resistance

01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,120
and it's a one of our developers called

01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,960
mike who's been working on this for a

01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,679
long time also with some researchers

01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,080
in belgium i believe the idea here is

01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,320
that you have an adversary that observes

01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,159
in an encrypted data stream and tries to

01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,800
be able using machine learning

01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:56,000
to figure out what sites is this person

01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,040
trying to visit

01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,440
it has become very relevant in both

01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,760
uh the world we have today where a lot

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,920
of websites is using tls but we also see

01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,360
tls being rolled out for

01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,360
uh dns and so on and in the

01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,560
sort of in the ietf protocol world there

01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,960
is a very big focus

01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,440
on performance that makes a lot of sense

01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,640
both in terms of cpu but also how much

01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:22,960
bandwidth we use to transfer data and

01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,920
adding padding to everything or trying

01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,360
to add

01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,960
fingerprinting resistance into the

01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,719
protocols by default

01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,480
might not be something an organization

01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,000
like ietf wants to do because they are

01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,560
focused on performance and

01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,120
bandwidth and so on but in tour we have

01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,880
built

01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,320
what i think is a pretty cool system

01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,400
where

01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,679
you basically the connection you make to

01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,080
the middle node

01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,880
has a little state machine in it that

01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,920
can

01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,600
make your traffic look like a some kind

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,080
of distribution

01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,600
so that we can change dynamically in the

01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,880
network to make the curve

01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,560
look differently and then if both the

01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,400
client and the middle node tries to

01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,719
honor these things

01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,000
the traffic that the guard is observing

01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,560
will be different from what the

01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,679
traffic um the exit node is seeing

01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,080
because we

01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,960
terminate this uh this additional

01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,880
padding at the

01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,239
at the middle node so this is something

01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,760
that's getting a lot of research right

01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:19,840
now and we're trying to

01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,840
keep up with that

01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,040
so we actually have a last question here

01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,040
so uh

01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,640
is the only way to install the tor

01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,280
browser on ubuntu

01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,400
by to download it from the website as a

01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:37,760
zip um

01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,760
is there an apt or dev package then

01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,360
um so

01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:45,280
there's the there's only one recommended

01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,960
way that's

01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:53,920
downloading it from our website um

01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,840
by by downloading the uh the top all the

01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,480
compressed toggle and then checking

01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,280
hopefully the signature at least

01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,560
we don't have to browser in any of the

01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:07,679
regular linux

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:10,640
package repositories mainly um

01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,280
due to lack of folks driving this idea

01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,520
forward

01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,280
we have been talking in the past getting

01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,400
it into debian but then

01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,440
it's not so easy because there's already

01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,840
firefox in it

01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,840
and what do we do with the tor browser

01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,159
which is essentially a firefox

01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,080
plus a couple of patches so there are

01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:30,800
some policy issues

01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,400
to to ride around and then once we would

01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,199
have it once we have it in debian it

01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,960
would be

01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,320
probably easy to get it in ubuntu as

01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,040
well um

01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,360
we agree that would be the the ideal way

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,520
to

01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,360
solve this problem on linux at least the

01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:46,880
packaging problem

01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:50,000
but right now that's not the case

01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,880
and it's not the case that anybody from

01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,520
the tour project

01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,679
is spending some time on this in the

01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,239
near and middle future

01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,760
so if somebody wants this and is able to

01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:05,120
help please step up we

01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,120
would be glad to to help them help us

01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:10,239
cool so thank you very much for the

01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,600
answers um

01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,280
there are some thank yous in the

01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,840
comments as well so it's

01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,920
not only me uh i'd also like to thank

01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,480
everyone who who participated during the

01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,840
days

01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,840
uh speakers listeners uh henrik and

01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,640
thompson and gina are helped out with

01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,080
the

01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,239
behind-the-scenes stuff and asking

01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,920
questions and so on um

01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:34,320
we will be around we are still trying to

01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,159
plan a physical event during next year

01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,600
we will see when it happens

01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,679
but if nothing else we will run a

01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,239
virtual event this spring

01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,600
if we cannot meet in person so thank you

01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:47,920
very much for everyone

01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:53,840
who listened and joined us take care

01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:53,840
