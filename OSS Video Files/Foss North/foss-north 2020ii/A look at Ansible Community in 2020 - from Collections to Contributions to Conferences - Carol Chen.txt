00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,879
slides

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
so 2020 has been an interesting year

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
hasn't it

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,840
well with any project there are constant

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,879
changes

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
large and small in 2020 the ansible

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,760
project

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,400
saw some major changes in terms of how

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,720
ansible is developed and delivered

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,799
as well as how our events have shifted

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
virtually overnight

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,439
something i'm that i'm sure the foster

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,759
north organizers are well aware of

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
thanks to johan and the force north for

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
having me here today

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
my name is carol chen and welcome to my

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,680
talk on

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,520
a look at ansible community in 2020 from

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,400
collections to contributions

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,400
to conferences

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,119
well let's start with a bit of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,200
self-intro

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,119
i did my graduate studies in computer

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
science in the united states

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,320
and started my career at nokia in dallas

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,040
texas

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,840
i took nokia's slogan of connecting

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
people

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
to heart and began to participate and

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
organized events in the local tech

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,520
and open source community here in

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,759
temporary finland

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
as a way to get to know people when i

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,040
first moved here

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,920
but also seeing the rewarding

00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
connections and

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,520
relationships that are born from such

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
events

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
when i joined red hat that was almost

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
five years ago

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
at first i was supporting the managed iq

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,920
community and i also gave

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,040
a talk on managed iq in falls north i

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
think about three years ago

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,200
about in 2018 i became part of the

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
ansible community team and have been

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
focusing on

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,760
outreach efforts for the ansible

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
community

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
a large portion of this talk will be on

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
events as

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,560
it pertains to the nature of my job

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
i've lived in four different countries

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,879
across three continents and have

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
visited more than 40 countries thanks to

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,519
my job

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,519
as well as a personal love for travel

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
and exploration

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,360
i've been to gothenburg several times

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
mostly thanks to foss north

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,800
and i hope i really hope i'll have a

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,640
chance to visit again in the near future

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
feel free to connect with me in some of

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,280
these channels

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
with the id sidebar

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
so export collections this is one of the

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,040
first major moves

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,040
we did this year and

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
like first of all we asked why why do we

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,159
have to move make such a drastic change

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
uh to ansible here the stats from

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,760
ansible project

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,200
in github you can see that it is a very

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,319
active and popular project

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,560
with almost 20 20 000 forks

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,400
more than 5 000 contributors making more

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,319
than what making over

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
50 000 commits and so on in ansible 2.9

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,200
which is the previous

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,159
version uh it was a big monolith

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,680
monolithic project and contained more

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:50,560
than three thousand modules

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,879
so a bit more history uh the project

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
started in 2012

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
and it grew steadily for a while

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,400
reaching around 1 000 modules

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,120
in the early 2017. so

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,959
over about five years however in the

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
past three years the growth has

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
accelerated and in the beginning of this

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,720
year with the expo 2.9 release

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,680
we had almost 3 3500 modules

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,519
included and then of course if you see

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,000
the drop at the end of the graph

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,600
it's because we um branched out into

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
collections which i will

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,759
go into more details later it does not

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,520
mean that all the

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,520
modules suddenly disappeared overnight

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,560
so with this incredible growth there

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,759
were definitely some

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
side effects from the customer's point

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,479
of view as

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
you know we have subscriptions in red

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,600
hat with customers

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,919
initially all the modules that were

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
shipped with expo were supported

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,639
over time when the popularity of the

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,639
project grew the community contributors

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,080
and the modules that were community

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,240
supported also grew

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
quite a bit since all the modules and

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,400
artifacts of ansible stayed in one place

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
it was not very clear what were the

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,919
supported ones by red hat

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,759
and which content were supported only by

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,479
the community

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
and as assisable is widely used in large

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,160
enterprises

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
there is a need for stability of having

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
a longer

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,360
life cycle for releases when the content

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,840
is part of the main

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
ansible project this would mean that

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,080
customers and users

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,039
would have to wait a long time until the

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,840
next

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,880
major version release for some new

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,000
module enhancements or updates

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,360
the enspo core engine would make make

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
sense to have a longer

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
life cycles as it is mature but the

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
contents such as modules

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,720
and plugins they require a much shorter

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
life cycle so that new features that are

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
constantly being developed

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,639
by the community and partners could be

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,680
updated and used

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,160
in ansible 2.9 when where the ansible

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,600
content was tied to the ansible release

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
this was not possible on the developer

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
side

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
the incoming volumes of prs and issues

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
outweigh the capabilities of the core

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
team

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
trying to address them all leading to a

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,960
lot of open issues and pull requests

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,600
in the in addition one size does not fit

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
all

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
the the requirements for a module that

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,479
talks to a cloud

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
compared to a module that talks to a

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
network device are different

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,360
lastly some contributors from the

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,080
community are more responsive

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
and develop they may develop and

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
implement things more quickly

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,800
while some take a longer time to respond

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,880
to requests thus

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,280
issues and prs take a much longer time

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
to get merged and resolved

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,080
that's the nature of open source project

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,080
contributions

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,280
carol real quick the the the camera feed

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,400
in the lower right corner is just the

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
black box

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,680
yeah so you still turn it off

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
yeah it's up to you just so that you

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,880
know it will come up to you

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
okay i turned off my camera i'll turn it

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,400
back on during the q a

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
yeah cool okay thank you thanks

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:16,240
all right so um now

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,560
to what what the changes are concretely

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,240
so the expo project is basically a

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,080
combination of two main parts the nsb

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,160
core engine which is responsible for

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,840
loading playbooks inventory files and

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
invoking the tasks

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
tasks will call the modules and carry

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,360
out work units on

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,560
the remote hosts the other part is

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
sensible content

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,919
which are the modules and plugins these

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,280
main parts exist

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,319
together in expo 2.9 and earlier

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,960
now known as the classic ansible

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,840
it is what you get when you what you got

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,240
with 2.99

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,479
earlier when you install when you type

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
pip install ansible

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,000
cluster cancel was developed almost

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,840
entirely within the inspo

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,840
slash ansible repository on github

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
so in expo 2.10 we separated the ansible

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
base and ansible content

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
going forward and introduced ansible

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,520
collections

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,000
the code base that is now contained in

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,039
github.com

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,599
is the expo base it contains a minimal

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,840
amount of modules and plugins

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,840
and allow other collections to be

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
installed

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,680
so ansible collections the rest of the

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,399
modules and plugins have been moved

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
into various collections which provides

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
a standardized way to organize package

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,959
and distribute ansible content

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
such as plugins rows and modules in the

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,240
collection

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,519
the components are well defined and

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,480
there is a standard for

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,240
direct for the directory structure and

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,080
it also requires the same

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,880
standard of documentation that the

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
engineer project requires

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
a collection can be released

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,120
independently of other collections or

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,279
the ansible base

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,880
so features can be made available sooner

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
to users

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
you can install a collection

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
independently with the ansible galaxy

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
command

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,399
and specifying the full the fully

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,399
qualified collection name

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
and finally the release package of

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
ansible 2.10

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
will pull in ansible base and the

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
various community collections that were

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,399
previously

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
a part of nsbo slash ansible in other

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
words

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,800
if you use pip install ansvo right now

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,640
it will continue to give you a full uh

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,399
working install of ansible including the

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,000
3000 plus modules

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,560
that previously shipped with ansible 2.9

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
all playbooks that worked with inspo 2.9

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,360
release

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,560
should continue to work without changes

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,600
to the playbooks

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,440
in the 2.10 release as small base will

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,839
contain a routing file

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:05,839
to map the new collection locations to

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,839
load the modules and plugins from

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,519
now let's look at some statistics

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,880
so as mentioned we had a large number of

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,279
pull requests

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
and with time to merge something like 50

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,600
days

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,880
and increasing it was not sustainable

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
the problem was not just about the

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,040
quantity of pull requests and such

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,959
but also the structural nature of having

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
everything in the same repo

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,240
if you take a look at the open pr's you

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,519
get page

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,279
after page of pull requests that may not

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
be relevant to the particular module

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,200
that you maintain

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,040
or interested in what you see in this

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
graph is the forecast

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,800
that our team's data scientist greg

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
sutcliffe

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,880
did earlier this year this was the

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,519
forecast of a set of time

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,200
series models that he built even the

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,880
most conservative models

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
which you can see in the top left

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,399
indicated by the blue lines which are

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,560
the models they showed

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
more than fifteen hundred pairs by mid

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
twenty twenty

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
with most of the other models we will be

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
going over three thousand more

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,720
uh prs by the end of this year

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,000
you can read the details in greg's blog

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
post

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,399
via the link which he goes in depth with

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
project data from the past to really

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,360
highlight

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,320
why we made the change to collections

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
and why it was needed

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
so after the change to collections these

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
are the um

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
graphs showing the contributors to the

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
individual

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
collections that have been pulled out of

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
ansible

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,200
separate from the ansible base these

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,399
graphs show the progress of each

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
collection

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
in regaining the momentum it had in

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,680
ansible slash ansible

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,839
we picked a one-year window back to

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,320
september of last year because after

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,959
this date collections were already

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
starting to be a thing and some code was

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
um

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,760
already moving out of the core and the

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,920
data was a bit more unclear after that

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
so here we have about six months of data

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,360
from collection

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,880
because even those things are moving

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
around september last year

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,120
the majority of the collections only

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,120
started to form around march this year

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,800
but as you can see uh from the start

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
things started getting momentum almost

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,200
right away for most of the

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
major collections

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,560
this is easier to work with oops

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,160
okay here we have um

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,839
maybe more interesting and also more

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,519
relevant graph especially when we talked

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,079
about all the different pull requests

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,120
and how long it takes to merge them

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,440
and you can see that um from the after

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
the move to collections

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
more about 75 percent of the pull

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,279
requests gets merged within

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
a couple of weeks uh we still have to

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,000
work on the issues though because you

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
can see that

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
about half of them gets closed after

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
three months which is

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,920
still pretty long time but um

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,240
you know it's already better than

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
previously and definitely the poor

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
the pull requests are moving at a lot

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,639
faster pace than before

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,200
so again um the details of all these are

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,120
public and available you can go to the

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
dashboard here to see

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
the different collections and play

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,920
around with it

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,160
and greg sutcliffe has a really well

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
in-depth video about all these different

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,880
changes

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,200
which is available to the other link

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,000
here and i will be sharing the slides

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,000
after this as well

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,079
so that was mainly about

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,560
the changes to collections and how it

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,079
has

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,959
been very effective in general and

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,720
allowing more people to contribute

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
easier because they can just focus on

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
one

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,160
particular collection rather than having

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,279
to dig through the whole ansible

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,800
base module which contains 3000 modules

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,920
along with it here's a

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,959
map of the enspo meetup

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,120
and github contributions so of course we

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,560
have

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,040
code contributions which mainly come

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
from github and you can see that mainly

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,800
via the green

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,800
colored indications in this map

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
and the other type of contributions we

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,839
talk about is uh

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,240
events and meetups and things like that

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,399
and you can see that via the blue

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,160
circles

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,720
so this data is gathered from github and

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,639
meetup.com apis

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,399
you can see that there are some hotspots

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,120
where people gather

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,199
and we have contributors in six

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,399
continents and local meetups

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,120
meet up groups in five continents so by

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,880
nature our community is very distributed

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,360
we communicate mainly through mailing

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,199
lists and rc channels

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
and i'm also aware of many community

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,160
driven online user groups

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,160
in various languages

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,480
so um yeah definitely like it's

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
we want to make it easy for people

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
around the world to contribute as well

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,639
as to

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,279
get connected and involved with each

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,600
other

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,519
in the project

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
we actually just had a contributor

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,880
summit two weeks ago

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
along with ansible fest

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,440
in in the second week of october now the

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,440
ansible

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,040
contributor summit is the event for

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,600
those who want to contribute

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
to the ansible project or have a desire

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,759
to do so

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,279
it is a full day or possibly days of

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
working sessions especially for

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,160
community

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,959
community contributors to interact with

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,279
one another

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,959
as well as with the development teams

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,399
such as the core team

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,800
awx galaxy and so on

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,560
at this summit we discuss important

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,240
issues affecting the ansible contributor

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,440
community to help shape the future of

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
ansible

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,839
with a focus on improving collaborations

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,120
with our contributors

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,120
the wiki page link here has

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,560
meeting minutes and logs from previous

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
contributor summits

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,320
as well as video recordings so if you're

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
interested

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,160
you can check them out currently i'm

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,800
still working through

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:36,000
um more than 16 hours of recordings from

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,680
last month's summit and so yeah

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,920
there was a lot of good discussions

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
there

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,000
here is a list of the instable

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,680
contributor summits that occurred

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,800
between 2017 and

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,920
2020. this is where if i were

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,240
giving this talk in person i'll ask

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,279
and do a show of hands you know who has

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,279
attended any of these and

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,959
have a more interactive discussion

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,520
but um with a virtual event i suppose

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,199
uh you can comment in chat which later

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,360
on i will see

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,079
uh i but i do miss the interactive

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,160
nature of live presentations in person

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,160
however even though our contributor

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,799
summits have been face-to-face events

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
prior to this year we have always

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,240
included a virtual component

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,440
to allow participation from those who

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,360
cannot attend in person

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,679
but the last time we had a physical

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,880
summit outside of the united states

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,799
was in june 2017 thus

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
while it is possible for contributors in

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,200
other parts of the world to join

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
virtually oftentimes the time

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
differences mean

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
that they cannot participate in the

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,559
event in

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,039
its entirety and since we have a

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,240
sizable group of contributors in europe

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,280
as you saw in the

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,520
map just now we decided that

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,520
my major task this year was to plan the

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,280
contributor summit somewhere in europe

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,840
for the in the first half of 2020

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,960
and we also set outsides to move even

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,679
further east

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,840
in asia or whatever but well one step at

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,840
a time

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,320
this is a graph that sums up the bunch

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,880
of text in the previous slide

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,400
i'm not really that great with diagrams

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,000
um or visual aids but

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
it's just a highlight that we went from

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,559
having contributor summits once or twice

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
a year depending on uncivil fast to

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,480
three times this year

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,240
after going fully virtual thanks to the

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
pandemic

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,520
there are definitely a lot of advantages

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,039
with online events

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,120
in many ways it is easier to put

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,120
together than a physical event

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,080
let's backtrack a little and take a look

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,080
at what could have been

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
i started sourcing for potential

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
locations already late last year as

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
organizing such an event has a pretty

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
long lead

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,559
time securing venues and catering

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,360
ordering and shipping

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,120
swag and so on plus i was really excited

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,760
to bring the contributor summit back to

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
europe

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,880
where i am based although we were not

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,039
attached to ansible fest for this

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
iteration we thought about co-locating

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,760
with another relevant event

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,240
for mutual support and exposure after

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,600
considering several great conferences

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,080
we decided upon force north

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
uh a great free and open source event in

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,000
northern europe

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,480
and you know um one that i attended

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
three times myself

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
i tried to confirm all the details as

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
early as possible

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799
in the beginning of the year with help

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,320
from johan actually

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,320
who provided a lot of suggestions

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,240
so that our community contributors could

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,120
make plans to attend

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,799
as well as to arrange travel for once it

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
seemed that most things were on schedule

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,679
and

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,080
going according to plan and i was really

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,080
excited

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
and then kobe 19 hit

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,760
so in the beginning of february at four

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,080
stem and config management camp

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,559
we started hearing about the coronavirus

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,760
being spread outside of asia

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,000
there was a slight unease at foster

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,120
if some of you were there you might have

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,080
known

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,679
it attracted thousands of attendees and

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
the stories about how contagious the

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
virus

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,080
is seemed unreal throughout the month of

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
february

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,240
more and more news about the virus

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,520
outbreak started to take shape

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,360
how serious the situation was and we had

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
to make the difficult decision to cancel

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
the in-person portion

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,679
of the contributor summit early in early

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
march

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,960
there was a financial penalty to this

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,320
cancellation

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
and we also did our best to help

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,600
community members who were unable to con

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,760
to cancel their travel arrangements um

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,840
to cover that for them

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,280
and we even said like oh this is such

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,960
bad timing what if

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
you know if we plan this for june or

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,919
july maybe we would

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,760
have been fine but well

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,840
it seems that you know it will be

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,320
earlier sometime next year before we

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,280
could

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
meet in person

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
all right um i had to put something

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,360
funny here

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,799
so to change the tone uh we had to make

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,400
some major changes

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,159
virtually overnight while um we've had

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
as mentioned we've had an online

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,280
component in our previous contribute

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,360
summits

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,960
now we have to do everything fully

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
virtual how would it look like

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,640
what platform should we use how do we

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,520
make it engaging

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
without being in person what time zone

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,559
should we host hosted in

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
now that a number of speakers and

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
attendees who were planning to fly over

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,039
from the us

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,440
will be eight hours behind it was a hard

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,440
pivot

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,080
okay so this was back in march um as you

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
know false

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,000
north was supposed to happen at the end

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,679
of march so when lockdowns were

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
happening around the world and all of us

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
were trying to adjust to do everything

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
virtually

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,679
from working to schooling from grocery

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,919
shopping to attending

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,720
events some were definitely more

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
challenging than

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,799
others i explored several virtual

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
platforms

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,799
but decided to stick with something

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,799
familiar

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,760
we've been using blue jeans video

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,960
conferencing at red hat and

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,480
a lot for our previous events so now for

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,400
a full virtual event

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,400
we decided to stick with blue jeans

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,720
i think um part of it because blue jeans

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,720
is fully supported by red hat i.t and

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,000
also a familiar

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,760
platform can bring some comfort

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,559
we also make sure the tools are

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,679
accessible to as many people as possible

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,760
for example it's not os specific or

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,840
platform specific

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,960
and you actually have also mobile

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,039
clients to use blue jeans

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,159
the upside is that everyone is on a more

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,000
equal footing

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
whereas sometimes at a face-to-face

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,039
event an online

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
audience may feel less integrated in the

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,000
event

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
so we wanted to keep the interactive

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,480
feel

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,320
and we use the meeting feature rather

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,600
than the broadcast feature in

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
the march event and everybody can talk

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,200
and chime in when they wanted to

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,799
instead of doing a one-to-many broadcast

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,280
this works well for the group sites we

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,039
had in march

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
as for the schedule instead of starting

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,880
at nine in the morning of central

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
european time which gothenburg was in is

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
in

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
we shifted it to start at one in the

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,360
afternoon so that we could accommodate

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,120
the participants across the pond

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,480
who are not able to travel to be in the

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,240
same time zone

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,320
um so yeah we try to encourage also

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,320
if possible because the contribution is

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,559
more of a discussion based

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,520
event rather than just presentation of

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,400
the presentation

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,000
we had people with cameras on whenever

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,880
they wanted to

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,679
so to get a more kind of connected and

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,679
interactive feel

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,919
i think the march even can be considered

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,720
a success given the constraints

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,240
that we had however a successful event

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
is by no means a perfect

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,480
event we sent out a survey after the

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,679
summit and received some valuable

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,320
feedback

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
in generally in general we had pretty

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,159
positive ratings

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,240
for the presentations technology and

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
accessibility of the event

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,000
some have problems with the event being

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,600
held on a sunday since

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,760
it's different when you're traveling to

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,279
an event versus when you're

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,640
attending from home with family and

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,159
other other obligations

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
suggestions for a better organized

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,080
agenda was also mentioned

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,919
and i agree having things more

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,039
structured is crucial for an online

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,400
event

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,679
even if it's a discussion based event

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,679
especially for something that's in a

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,120
completely new format and arrangement

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,919
this will help to set the right

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,919
expectations

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,679
after having the positive vibes from the

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
first fully virtual

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,080
and simple contributor summit we try to

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
make it more regular

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,640
taking advantage of the online format in

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,520
the second edition we had more people

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
attend

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
and i'll share some numbers in just a

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,600
minute

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,480
we kept the format roughly the same

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,240
and most of it seems to work fine

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,159
although we changed the event today

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,600
to a monday since people complained

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,720
about the sunday the

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,480
the time the in the previous event we

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,039
stayed in the in between u.s and

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,200
european time zone as we anticipated

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,279
that the

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
the following contributor summit which

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,880
is the one in october

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,720
would be in u.s eastern time so we had

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,919
people joining throughout the day

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,159
and we did several rounds of

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,159
introductions which i i could

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
encoura i would encourage if you have a

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,600
manageable group size

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,480
so that people get to know everyone in

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,039
the group we did the presentations live

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,840
and monitored blue jeans chat and rc

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,039
channels for questions

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,279
for some topics we had um yeah

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,880
so some some types of topics we just

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,360
encourage people to turn on their mics

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,159
and

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,320
join in instead of being one person

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,600
speaking all the time

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,720
and you can watch back

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,320
other videos from the

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,320
events in our youtube channel

00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,720
[Music]

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,320
all right so once again we set up the

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,080
survey uh as

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,159
with the march event we send out one

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
after the july event

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,080
by the way these prettier and fancier

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,400
graphs are again thanks to greg

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,600
sutcliffe the data scientists which i

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,039
mentioned earlier

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,799
in any case the mps score is quite high

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,279
still still quite high from for the

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,000
second event but

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,000
in the free comments section we received

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,080
mixed feedback about the unconference

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,600
format which we were trying out to

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,880
facilitate more engagement and

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,880
discussions

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,080
i guess it's not too surprising that an

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
online

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,919
unconference is more even more

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
challenging

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,640
given the feedback about agenda

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,640
structure in the previous one

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,399
so talking about attendee numbers

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,200
um prior to 2019

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,520
i think we've had around 40 to 60 people

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,760
at the summits in person i don't have

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,039
the exit numbers as i've only let

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,520
the event planning from this year

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,360
so uh in 2019 we were pleasantly

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,320
surprised to have close to 100 people

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,840
show up at

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,840
last year's uh in atlanta and uh

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,880
keep in mind that these are contributors

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,120
so not just

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,880
uh general and superfast attendees

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,240
even though the numbers went back to the

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,720
50 to 70

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,240
range early this year we were encouraged

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,640
by the level of engagement

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,159
that maintained throughout the day which

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,600
is a lot harder online than

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,720
if you're in person for the march event

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,679
in gothenburg

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,080
we ended up with only 30 registration in

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,640
in the midst of the corona news

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,000
but at the end 50 attended the virtual

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,880
event

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,200
so that was quite encouraging um that

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,640
the virtual event actually helped

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,279
to uh allow more people to join

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,440
for the july event we were back to more

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,679
than 100 registrations

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,760
and 70 showed up i think by this time

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,679
people were getting used to

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,720
uh online events and uh

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,440
what the problem of the rsvp account as

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,039
you know like

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,960
out of a hundred people who registered

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,760
maybe if you are lucky if half of the

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,039
people show up

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,039
especially for free events

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,039
so when i was preparing for the third

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,360
contributor summit this year in october

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,360
i was expecting to do everything quite

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,279
similarly to the first two

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,799
um because you know we're getting about

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,880
50 to 70 people

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,799
a couple of hundred people signing up if

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,880
we're lucky and so on

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,720
however because thanks to the push from

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,919
ansible fest we had

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,159
more than one thousand people

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,440
registering for

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,760
the third contributor summit and we had

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,360
to

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,080
withdraw sorry scramble to try to decide

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
what to do

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,640
because um we were not expecting this

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,320
many people

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,159
so based on the interest we pivot again

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,000
with a different format we ended up with

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,840
two days of content the first one

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,720
targeted towards new contributors

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,640
because i think most of them are having

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,440
heard about this only through ansible

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
fest

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,440
and the second one for regular and

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,559
seasoned contributors so it's more akin

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,760
to what we had

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,480
in the previous contributor events

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,559
and this time we used prime time blue

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,760
jeans primetime which is the broadcast

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,440
format

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,159
because we had such a large audience and

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,440
we were not able to have everyone

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,720
with their videos and microphones on

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,120
so at the end of these two days

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,919
about 700 people attended over the two

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,799
days

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,399
from 67 countries the number of

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,200
countries is almost as much as the

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,520
number of attendees in the past event

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,279
so that's almost 10 times the previous

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
event

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,919
of course um 10 times the attendance

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,000
does not mean 10 times the participation

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
and we are still analyzing the event

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,240
data such as

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,760
frequency of the chats and the questions

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
us and so on

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,440
and there will be a post event survey uh

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,039
i actually know that the post event

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
server went out last week we were still

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,320
collecting data from there

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,000
and we will share our findings in our

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,000
newsletter the bull horn

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
which you can find from the link here

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,080
but based on the post and during the

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,480
event and the preliminary feedback

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
it seems to be pretty well received even

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,679
though we had to cater to

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,679
a 10 times larger event

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
so um yeah here's just some data that we

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,320
managed to

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,279
to get uh right after the event uh

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,200
through blue jeans about the number of

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,159
participants from different

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,399
parts of the world as you can see uh

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,279
they're people joining from

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,960
pretty much everywhere from from asia

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,159
pacific to

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,919
north and south america to even africa

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,960
and europe this graph is adjusted

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
for time zones so again you can see in

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,600
the u.s

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,120
most people join in the morning because

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,120
that's when

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,640
it's mainly in the morning in in the

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,519
daytime in the u.s

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,840
and for europeans it'll be mid-afternoon

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,240
to

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,320
a bit later in the evening and quite

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,799
late for those joining from

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,679
asia and we actually had a lot of

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,679
participants from

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,200
india who stayed till maybe two or three

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,840
in the morning so that was

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,000
really touching and and encouraging to

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,679
see

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,080
um i i need to revisit this

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,440
uh mexico because mexico should be in

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,000
the same time zone as the u.s

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,000
but here it says it's in the evening for

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,200
them so something's wrong there

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,880
you check that but anyway um lots of

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,960
uh great participant participation and

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
encouraging to see so many people attend

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,000
all right so um i hope you're following

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,399
along

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,240
still so far and i would like to

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,440
incentivize participants

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,200
whether it's for uh

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,039
virtual events we host and also for

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,080
talks i give at other virtual events

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,919
so if you're still here with me or if

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,080
you happen to watch a playback of this

for false north

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,679

i receive will get to choose to

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,399
either get a pair of ansible socks or a

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,840
nice

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,159
tack case shown here the tech case is

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,200
has like different compartments and also

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,760
adjustable

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,720
bands where you can organize your wires

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,799
and cables and

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,799
tech accessories so it's really handy

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,200
so yeah we hope that the interest and

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,799
contributions keep up and

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,760
we're definitely happy to share

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,880
swag and use that to incentivize

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,559
participation

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,760
i think it's a you know not that without

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,919
um in-person events a lot of people

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,599
complain about not being able to get

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,599
little things and even simple things

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,159
like stickers you know we kind of miss

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,399
that

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,359
and we're just trying to find ways to be

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,800
able to

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:24,639
share back with the community

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,320
meet up um while events like ansible

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,119
fest and the ansible contributor summit

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,320
provides

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,480
an opportunity for global users

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,240
uh and global user and contributor

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,560
communities to get together

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,399
meetups serve an important purpose in

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,560
building local communities in different

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,000
cities regions and also in various

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,079
languages

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
contributions can come in many forms

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,200
other than code

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,119
and organizing meetups is one of these

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,879
ways

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,960
we have numerous meetup groups around

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,520
the world

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,119
as you can see from the

00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,760
ansible.meetup.com link

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,119
and many if not most of them are led by

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,720
community members

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,280
include yeah so and if you want to know

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,839
how to

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,200
start a meetup group in your region or

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,480
language or whatever

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,359
click on these um ansible.com

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,400
community events expo meetups link will

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,400
give you more information

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,640
as with conferences and summits most

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,040
meetups have gone virtual since

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,839
around march this year there was

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,640
certainly an

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,079
initial period of what do we do now

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,440
maybe we'll wait and see

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,200
and resume meetups in a couple of months

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,720
but i think we all realize quickly that

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
in-person meetups won't be happening

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,240
again anytime

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,320
soon and we might as well make the best

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,760
of the situation

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,680
especially when knowledge sharing and

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,680
networking is so much a part of who we

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,960
are in the community

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,960
between the march and september um

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,839
dates which happened to be equinoxes

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,720
from the time i took this

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:04,800
data we see that in 2019

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,640
there were 83 inspo meetups

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,480
around the world this year the number is

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,599
60 in the same period

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,359
after in the initial drop meetup pace

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,640
has picked up again in the last couple

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,480
of months

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,839
some sponsors that used to provide

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,760
venues and snacks

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,520
now share their virtual conferencing

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,839
platforms

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,920
the familiar faces of a local group

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,880
might might now include a few new ones

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,320
from different parts of the world

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,280
we had like a meet up in virtual meetup

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,560
in ensembl

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,839
india group from so you know that

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,760
we used to have like a dozen or so

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,400
different meetup groups in india

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,040
and they can all join in one big virtual

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
group

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,320
and we even have people from north

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,440
america joining in

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,440
who are interested we will continue to

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,000
assist local meetup groups but i think

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,839
for the most

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,320
part they have made the transition

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,320
pretty well

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,920
i actually have done a separate talk

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,320
just on meetups

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,800
and including how the adjustments to

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,160
virtual meetups

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,119
was affecting everything and if so if

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,960
you're interested

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,800
you can take a look at this youtube

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,320
video of my talk

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,599
at the open source summit north america

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,800
north america but actually was virtual

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,000
instead of in austin as we go forward i

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,079
do wonder when we

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
will be able to resume face-to-face

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,599
events

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,880
but i do find that virtual events

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,640
provide new opportunities to connect

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,320
and today is one good example

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,480
as long as we have the desire to

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,720
establish and stay connected

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,200
i think we will find ways to do so we

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,839
will try different tools and formats

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,480
fail many times along the way and learn

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,480
from it all

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:05,839
thank you for your time and i'll be

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,839
happy to take questions and comments

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,440
right thanks a lot carol uh we have some

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,040
questions from the youtube audience

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,040
all right let me find my camera first

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,880
okay

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,160
all right so should i should i'll stop

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,000
sharing okay

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,839
can you see me now yeah this works fine

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,680
yeah so the first question is do you

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,079
have any expert tips for people hosting

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,839
online conferences or hackathons

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,839
expert tips

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,240
i i i will not call myself an expert

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,320
even though i've hosted quite a bit of

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,880
virtual events this year

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
but um a lot of it was by trial and

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,680
error you

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
i really i didn't have anything to you

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,160
know we didn't have any models to follow

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,280
so i i tried different formats different

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,680
platforms

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,760
um and uh i think one big thing is

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,040
a lot of times we usually have a budget

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,280
to start with right like

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,040
we you know one big thing is the venue

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,400
costs a lot of money and then

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,040
having people fly over so in that sense

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,200
the whole mindset has to be shifted we

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,280
don't think in terms so much in terms of

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,720
money but although that we still have

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,760
some costs involved

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,359
but we really think about um how

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,280
how to get people more engaged

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,160
especially the virtual platform

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,680
and another thing i think is we don't

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,520
necessarily have to

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,320
try to re replicate everything

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,240
about an in-person event sure we have

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,320
the hallway track that we say is one of

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,920
the best things about in-person events

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,480
and it's really hard to replicate in a

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,079
virtual event but maybe

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,240
you know the goal of the virtual event

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,440
is not just to

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,359
try to have everything at the same as a

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,200
uh in-person event but to take advantage

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,400
of what the virtual platforms can

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,720
provide

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,000
um that an in-person event cannot and

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,960
make use of that

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,400
as as more more advantage to for having

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,200
virtual events which one of the

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,480
main things we have seen is so many

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,680
people from around the world can

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,079
participate

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,760
and ask good questions and you know

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,480
these people we usually can't reach

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:17,680
with physical face-to-face events

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,040
yeah we were kind of surprised both me

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,800
and some people in the in the youtube

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,920
chat with the the numbers you got on the

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,160
october event

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,720
yeah did you do something extra when it

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,839
came to like marketing for the event or

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,960
like why why did it suddenly show up

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:36,800
700 people yeah right yes okay so

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,560
um as mentioned previously the

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,319
previous contributor summits have been

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,200
kind of tied to associated with the

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,880
ansible fest

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,560
which is more of a general event that

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,680
has users and

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,240
customers and partners so

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,599
but even as a physical event because

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
people have to book travel to the

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
location

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,839
and if they want to join the contributor

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,800
summit they book an extra day

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,440
of hotel and accommodation and and you

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,680
know

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,200
preparation for that so it's even if

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,040
there were like you know ten thousand

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,680
people at ansebo fest

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,960
we still get like a hundred percent

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,680
around 100 for the

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,599
contributor summit however this year

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,599
everything went virtual

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,720
expo went virtual and had like you know

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,400
two three times the sign

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,839
ups and because in the registration days

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
we had a question if you're interested

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,760
in a contributor summit

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,520
um we will send you more information and

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,319
like almost half the people said yes

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,560
we're interested

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,920
maybe they wouldn't realize what

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,599
contributing was about

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
which which when after we shared more

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,760
information uh

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,839
only a fraction of those actually

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,280
registered for the contributor summit

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,599
but then again even though it was a

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,640
fraction it was still like 10 times the

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,760
numbers we had in previous events

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,040
so so we had to to to think okay who are

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,240
these people why are they suddenly

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,480
interested i think well

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,880
again probably because now that the

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,440
virtual events are so accessible

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,319
um anybody can attend from anywhere in

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,480
the world so

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,560
you know we took this as an opportunity

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,960
to reach out and then hopefully get more

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,560
new contributors which we did we

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,000
not in huge numbers but we had people

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,680
start submitting prs

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,920
right from the day itself and things

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,359
like that so

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,160
i think it's partly thanks to the

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,040
virtual sense of it all and also

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,240
um usually so fast get a bit more

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,800
exposure than

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,599
a small contributing event so it's

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,960
thanks to those

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,560
factors all right yeah maybe even though

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
there haven't been that many new

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,040
contributors maybe you planted a seed at

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,040
least

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,079
exactly exactly once i mean you you

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,560
can't get the numbers

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,160
without initially reaching out to these

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,640
people

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,000
yep all right thank you very much that's

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,079
the issue that's all the questions

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,839
we had i think all right that's all

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,839
oh actually there was a new question

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,520
just arriving right now

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,200
so renat is a company that's working

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,440
mainly remote how has

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,480
kobe affected you in your role at red

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,160
hat

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,319
okay so yes i actually like officially i

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,920
work from home i i live in tampere

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,079
finland we have an

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,599
office in finland in aspo which is like

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,960
you know two hour train ride away and

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,560
everything so i

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,200
even from the start i was working

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,680
remotely um the main thing that has

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,920
changed uh was that i don't get to

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,880
travel anymore so i get to

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,359
um because i was traveling around 40 to

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,200
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,720
of my time for events and conferences

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,119
and things like that so

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,760
that part is completely gone at least

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,160
for the

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,599
foreseeable future but you know now

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,440
everything is

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,280
online and good thing about virtual

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,480
conferences is i can do it anywhere as

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,119
long as i have a good internet

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,440
connection

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,400
so that that's mainly how it has changed

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,040
right yeah okay yeah thank you very much

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,880

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,280
