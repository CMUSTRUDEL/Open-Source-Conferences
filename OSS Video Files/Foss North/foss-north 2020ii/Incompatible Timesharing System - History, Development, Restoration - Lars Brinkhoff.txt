	00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
welcome to another

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:30,480
virtual frost north event big thanks to

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:32,640
our sponsors and partners

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
welcome back and now we have los

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
blinkoff who will talk about the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
its think incompatible time sharing

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
system so lars

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,360
the stage is yours thank you

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,800
hello everyone my name is lars sprinkov

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,239
and i'm here to talk about the

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,000
incompatible time sharing system

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,520
so first first of all what is its

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,559
a little overview on my presentation

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,920
uh what is its and

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,479
what i'm going to talk about its history

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
and some of the special values and

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,840
features

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,799
and a little bit about what's going on

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
today

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,799
first of all what is its the

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,560
incompatible time sharing system

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,600
it's an operating system for the pdp

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,040
10 family of computers

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:34,479
it was created at the mit

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,360
university in 1976

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,840
and it had a pretty good run it was kept

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,960
running

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,200
until 1990

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
and it's especially known for its

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,680
openness

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,680
and lack of security

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
many people ask me why am i doing this

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,920
yeah it has a long background

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,880
i started with the home computers and

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,240
basic programming as a kid

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
and i got really interested in computers

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
and

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,720
read all the books in the library and

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,400
among those the one picture here the

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,280
hacker's dictionary

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:23,599
which has a lot of information about ids

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:28,000
and later i added

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:31,040
pdb 11 supports to bin utils

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,640
and after that i also added ptp 10

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,680
supports

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920
to the gcc compiler so

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,400
i got started on the this pdp 10

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
computer

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,000
and i also do it because i

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,519
i think it's its has a very interesting

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
history and

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,480
it has something important to tell us

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,360
even today

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,319
and last but not least i think it's

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
basically more

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,400
fun than playing a regular computer game

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,280
and because it's all about learning

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,840
interesting things

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,840
and exploring and solving puzzles

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,480
so the pdp 10 computer

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,680
this was made by the successful company

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,879
digital equipment corporation which no

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,440
longer exists

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
but when they were being in the 60s and

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,720
70s

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:36,319
and 80s the pdb10

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,239
it started at the pdp 6 in the middle

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:44,159
of 1960s and

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:48,959
new generations kept coming until

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,959
the family was shut down in the late 80s

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,959
so it started with the p26 and then

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,640
there were

00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:00,080
four versions of the pdb10 um

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:05,040
which usually are called ka10 ki

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,040
10 kl10 and ks10 for the processor

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,040
this computer it was designed

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,320
with the lisp in mind which was

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
a little bit special for this time in in

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,919
one sense

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,240
you can even call it like the first lisp

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,360
machine in a way

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,919
because uh those are no lisp you will

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
know that

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:34,880
there is the important concept of a cons

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:38,960
cell which has two addresses in one item

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,639
so the pdp 10 has an 80 bit address

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,199
and two of those fit inside the 36-bit

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
world length

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
it has a very nice instruction set

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,520
so all the programmers really like this

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880
computer

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,440
and it was also a very popular on the

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
predecessor to to internet today which

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,360
was called arpanet

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,360
which began in the early 70s

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
and it's uh it's really a big iron mine

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,400
frame

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,199
mainframe kind computer i

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
squeezed in a little photo at the bottom

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,759
this is

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,440
a small configuration of a pdp-10

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,880
and the cpu alone are these

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,639
two boxes in the middle

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
so it's not a small machine exactly

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,280
a little bit the background

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,720
about what

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,280
what existed before its and why its was

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
created

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,080
mit had a famous artificial intelligence

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,199
group started in the late 50s

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,039
and they met you also researched

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,319
time sharing there is computers which

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,720
you can use many people simultaneously

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,759
before that most computers used batch

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,240
processing by handing in a deck of cards

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
to an operator the operator loaded the

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
cards

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,000
and maybe all got a result back the

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
other day or so

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
so this is a really awkward way of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,639
working

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
so this concept of time sharing was

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
introduced

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
which is basically what we all are using

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,840
today

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
so the first time sharing system at mit

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,520
was called

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:43,520
ctss compatible time sharing system

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,520
and was developed in the early 60s

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:52,000
to develop this further

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:55,919
the project mac was started at mit

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
which was created to

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,319
make a new better operating system

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,440
called multix

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,319
and researchers were

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
planning this operating system for many

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
years and

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,800
started implementing it for even more

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,360
years

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,360
so the artificial intelligence group

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
they were

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
impatient and wanted something for their

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,240
for their own computer

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,199
so they this ai group they were part of

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
project mac

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
and they got a pdb6 computer

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,599
uh at first they just used it uh

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,720
one one by one so you have to

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,440
allocate the time share time slot for

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
your

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
work it's maybe one or two hours and

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,759
then the next

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,680
person came along and did his or her

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,479
work

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,120
so they decided that this is too awkward

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,400
we

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,400
also wanted time sharing system

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,840
so they basically took my many of their

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,720
single user tools and they created a new

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,639
operating system from scratch and this

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,120
happened in 1970

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,120
67 sorry 1967.

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,520
this was in their view a better

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,639
alternative to the previous

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,280
ctss operating system and also to multix

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,280
and i included a photo of this very

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,680
pdp-6 computer

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,440
to the bottom left and another picture

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,479
i found in the its file system

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,120
which says happiness is

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,880
not using multiplex so this is this is

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:54,480
kind of hardly how the people

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:58,640
felt about ctss and multix

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,080
uh iks is uh quite special because it

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
was created by

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
hackers and by hackers i mean the

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,839
original

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,839
hackers which came from mit in the

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,760
beginning

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,720
this is not the computer criminal

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
criminal of today

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,800
but they are enthusiastic programmers

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,480
and to the right is one of them richard

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,240
stallman

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
pictured in the computer lab

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,839
the hackers they they wanted to

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
get access to group computer get work

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,399
done

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
they didn't make the operating system as

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,560
an academic

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,920
exercise which they felt was more

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
like what maltix did

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,959
it was very interactive

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
typically when you use a program when

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,040
you type one key

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,040
something happens this is in uh

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,560
opposite of what's multi-x did very neat

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,920
typically use an entire line of text to

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
interact with a program

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,640
they also had no passwords and no file

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,760
permissions so

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,200
anyone was allowed to log in and see all

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,839
the files

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,880
again this was because i wanted to work

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,760
and not have

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
any obstacles

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,000
there is also source code for everything

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160
so everyone could improve programs if

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
they wanted

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,839
and i also allowed the guests from

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,360
outside

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,160
both people living nearby kids

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,480
sometimes and also people logging in

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,600
from over the arpanet

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,000
some of those grew to become

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
hackers and its programmers themselves

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
after its was first created in the late

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,040
60s there was a period of

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:12,399
early development they

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,720
got a pdp 10 computer for the ai group

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,720
which the pdp 10 is a better version of

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,200
the pdp 6

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
basically

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,079
they added hardware for virtual memory

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,399
in 1970 they connected the machine to

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,240
the

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,600
arpanet to interact with all the other

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,560
researchers and programmers

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
and they two more groups got their own

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
pdp

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,880
tens and installed its the dm

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:50,480
and ml groups dynamic modeling and

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,040
math lab so these are

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,760
at the bottom there are the three only

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,600
photos of those machines i found

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:03,360
so that's the ai pdp 10 to the left

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,160
the dm in the middle and the mo

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,160
to the right

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,920
its and the pdp 10 machines they were

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
actually used for

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,800
real research not just for hackers to

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,079
play around with

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,560
of course they use them to

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,560
do artificial intelligence research

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,079
also robotics and computer vision which

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,839
is

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,839
part of ai

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,880
the logo programming language was

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,880
largely developed with ids

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,320
lisp and scheme were heavily influenced

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
by its

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
they even made a specialist machine for

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,519
running lisp

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,839
and two more programming languages that

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,800
are less well known are model

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,800
and clue which i'll talk about some more

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,040
and there was also a very important

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,079
application called maxima which was used

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,920
for

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,760
mathematical calculations

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,399
and they were also researching

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,839
networking because they

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,839
were attached to arpanet

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,720
the pictures are a logo turtle

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,079
which were used by kids to draw lines

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
on the floor and the thing in the green

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,639
room is

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,199
an imp interface sorry interface message

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,560
message processor which is kind of the

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,560
router for arpanet

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,240
so a little bit more about lisp

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,760
it was created in the late 50s by the

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,760
professor john mccarthy

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,519
it was initially implemented for an ibm

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,160
machine

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,880
but it quickly moved to other machines

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,399
like the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,920
pdb6 at the project mac

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,399
so this special project mac version of

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,440
lisp was called mac lisp

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,800
which influenced many other lisp

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,920
programming sorry uh list

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,920
dialects later

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,800
they had a lisp compiler which was

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,199
really

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,519
did a really great job of generating

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,519
code

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,959
and like i said before they made a list

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,079
machine which is

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:47,440
pictured to the right in the middle

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,120
also the famous lisp dialect scheme

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,120
was created with ideas

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,519
so maxima mixing was also implemented in

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,680
mac lisp

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,680
by this professor professor joel moses

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,360
it was very important for many

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,079
researchers on arkanet because they used

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
it to

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,839
do mathematical calculations and

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,760
symbolic

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:21,040
manipulation since this was

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,839
written in mclisp they received a lot of

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,079
money to

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:29,680
develop mcle spend its compiler further

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,800
and just because of the maxima they

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
bought two more pdp 10 computers for

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,000
hosting the

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,959
development and running maxima

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,440
so it's all in a way very important for

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
its

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
uh another important necklace

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,759
application

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,880
is called true glue

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,279
it's a kind of a robot simulation

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,360
where you can see a rubik's arm picking

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,480
up blocks and you can

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,839
tell it things in a natural language

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,040
and ask it questions and tell it

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,839
to solve puzzles like

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,519
if you need to tell it to put a block on

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,240
another block and it's already occupied

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,079
by a

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,519
pipe pyramid it will figure out for

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,920
itself that it needs to

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,959
first remove that pyramid so this is a

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,959
important

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,959
early application of ai

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,440
a little bit more about the logo

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,560
programming language

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,639
it was created first at the bbn

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,800
company in the same city as mit

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,800
but early on it moved to mit

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,959
the implementation was ported to its

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
and later ported to the smaller pdp 11

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,519
machine

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,720
and they wrote many other versions

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,759
for one was implemented in mclis and

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
they

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,720
made a version for the apple ii which

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
became quite popular

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:16,000
and it's quite famous for this turtle

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,000
the small

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,559
semi-spherical device which is a robot

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,600
that

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,600
draws lines on the floor

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,880
and they also made a special logo

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,840
machine to run

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,840
logo which they try to sell to

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
schools

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,160
the model programming language it's

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
quite similar to lisp

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
actually it's more or less a dialect of

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,000
lisp

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,440
it was used just used by the one

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,080
dm pdp 10

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,760
but it's quite famous for being the

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,520
language in which the game's

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,919
work was written

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,440
this game led to the formation of the

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,799
infocom company

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,200
and later the boom of

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,039
text adventure games on microcomputers

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,240
in the 80s

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,679
and was also used to bootstrap the next

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,960
computer language called

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,559
clue clue

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,919
is short for cluster which really means

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,919
class or something like that

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,919
this is a very influential

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,760
programming language which few people

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,880
had heard about

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,440
but if you ask for example the

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
people who made c plus or pearl or ruby

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,320
they

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,919
will tell you that they knew about this

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,280
programming language and they were

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,520
inspired by it it was

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,799
the first programming language to

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,039
introduce data abstraction in a big way

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
which is something that which we take

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,799
kind of for granted

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,520
these days but this was a quite a new

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,919
idea by at that time

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,280
and it also has all the things you

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
expect from a modern

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,640
programming language today like

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,080
exceptions iterators

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,280
even parametric types so it kind of

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
feels like

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,280
something made in the 1990s but it was

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
created in the early 70s

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
and the woman on the photo is

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,240
barbaliskov she's the one

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
who invented its language

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:40,000
so in the middle 1970s

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:43,120
were the heydays for ids

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
they created a network file system which

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,640
at first as far as i know is the first

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,880
network file system

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:57,280
they also created raster displays

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,280
which were quite new at that time

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,039
and these fancy they added these fancy

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,960
keyboards

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:08,880
with the meta control top and all

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:12,480
those strange keys which are

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,919
typically used with list machines

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,440
in 1975 they bought one more

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:24,400
pdb 10 the latest and greatest kl10

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,400
processor which is pictured to the right

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,159
the famous editor emacs was created on

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,080
its

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,080
in 1976

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:41,039
and in the early 80s when the arpanet

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:43,600
switched to tcpip the

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:49,840
its networking stack was also updated so

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,840
they kept up with the times

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,320
people usually like you to play games so

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,400
we have many games running on

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,360
its we have the famous space war game

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
that first ran on a pdp-1 computer at

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,640
mit

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,360
but it was also ported to the pdb6 and

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,480
10 computers

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,400
we have the mac hack chess

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,600
program it was written by

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,440
an its programmer actually

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,159
by the its program by the programmer who

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,679
was most mostly responsible for writing

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,440
ideas

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,919
richard greenblatt he's also a

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,480
avid chess player himself so he created

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,200
a chess program which was the best

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,200
chess program for most of these 70s

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,000
there was a flight simulator the

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
adventure

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,720
text game was sported twice

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,280
uh maze war in the middle

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,760
where you it's one of the first first

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,840
person shooter games

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
and like i said before that was the work

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,240
its it's not just about the pdp 10

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,720
computer

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,679
there were was a lot of smaller

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,080
computers

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:17,039
around around the central p10 computer

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,400
so they still had the old pdp6 it was

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,679
running standalone kind of like a

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,679
microcontroller of today if you will

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:32,480
there were many smaller pdp 10 computers

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,559
to offload the main pdb10

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,919
uh the first list machine was called

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,159
cons

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,240
it was directly attached through shared

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,440
memory to the

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,679
ai lab computer

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,880
there's also a special key ops chess

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,880
machine accelerator

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:57,200
there was a gt40 which is small

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,200
pdp 11 picture to the upper right

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,039
uh the imlac to the lower left

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,600
is the one that was used to play the

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,000
maze game

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,840
and the logo machine is to the lower

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,360
right

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,000
and all tools and software for these

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,039
machines were hosted on ids

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,840
so its was the development environment

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,840
system for these machines

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,360
ideas has some special features and also

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,360
limitations

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:39,760
one of the most important feature

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,760
is called pc losering

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,400
that means that the

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,919
the process the user program pc

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,039
program counter it's never inside the

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,760
middle of a

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,640
system called whenever another process

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,240
wants to

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,440
access its state so if one

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,360
program is doing is executing an

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,799
operating system call

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,600
it will either back it out or quickly

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,039
complete it whenever another program

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,559
like a debugger

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,559
wants to see the program

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,880
we have processes and even processors

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
available as files like today

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,240
one of the most prominent features which

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,039
you see immediately

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,640
when you use its is that the user

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,799
interface

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,159
which you see when you log in is that

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,960
actually a debugger

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,960
called ddt

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,880
uh many people find it strange at first

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,360
but it's actually a very

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,200
very nice user interface because it's a

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,559
debugger after all is

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,720
a perfect program for loading other

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,799
programs and starting them

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,000
and examining them if there's something

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,279
wrong and so on

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,720
like i said before most programs are

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,200
very interactive

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,520
and actually if you used emacs before

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,440
they kind of have this similar feel to

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,880
it because i use a lot of control

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
and meta combinations

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,760
then they had also used space device

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,360
device drivers

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,159
like we have today and for

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,200
robotics they had real time scheduling

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,679
to control

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,000
various machines they had one of the

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,279
first terminal independent text output

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,200
systems

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,200
to adapt many different terminals

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,720
but on the limitation side there was

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
just one level of directories so you

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,960
can't have

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,159
a directory inside another directory

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,799
and file names they have two parts each

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,520
of which

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,559
can be just six characters so that's

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,559
that's kind of limiting

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,200
so in the 80s there was a decline period

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,279
for its

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,640
the old pdp six and ka tens

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,799
they were getting harder and harder to

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,279
keep up running so they were eventually

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,279
scrapped

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,240
they were replaced replaced by newer

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,440
ks10 machines

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,440
in the mid-80s

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,640
even the newest greatest kl10 was

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,679
shipped

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,919
actually to sweden in 1988

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,000
where it was kept in storage for many

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,080
many years until it was shipped to

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,080
seattle a few years ago

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,400
and eventually all computers running its

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,440
were shut down

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,919
in 1990 mostly due to disk and memory

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
problems

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,080
here's something that illustrates the

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,840
use of its over the years

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,919
they are all the unique timestamps from

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:16,559
backup tapes so we can see it sharply

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:20,399
increased until the mid 70s

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:24,480
the peak in 1976 i think this is

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,279
due to the new kl10 machine which hosted

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,480
many more

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,480
people at the same time

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,440
and uh throughout the late 70s

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,399
where there were was a relatively stable

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,679
period

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:43,200
and then a decline in the early 80s

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:49,840
this one a much smaller peak in 1986

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,840
probably due to the new ks10 machines

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:58,799
another set of data from timestamps

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,799
are all the its version numbers

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,440
as you can see it starts in 1971 which

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,480
is when the first backup tapes

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,600
were written and at that point

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,000
the ids version number was

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:20,960
in the late 600s

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,399
this grows steadily over the years

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,679
we can see a jump in 1984

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,200
five ish this is probably due to the new

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,960
ks10 machines

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
which is probably where the a lot of

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,760
development were made and new versions

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,080
were released frequently

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
and then in the late 19th we can see the

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,200
versions are tapering out

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:49,840
to finally end at the

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,840
mid 1600s in 1990

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,919
so its has some kind

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,200
that's a bit of historical important

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,559
importance and

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,559
still has a legacy today

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,039
the new project was started

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,120
by one of the ita's its hackers

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,799
richard stallman emacs the editor is

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,399
still popular today

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,600
and gnu projects uses the info system

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:27,279
which uses the exact same same files as

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,600
on ids the hoeis

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,480
network information system took its name

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,840
from an ids program

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,120
and two major lisp dialects emacs list

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,279
and comma lisp

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:44,320
are heavily influenced by mac lisp

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,320
the mita key on found on some keyboards

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,679
today

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,640
are probably due to the emacs editor

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,640
so can trace

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,159
it it's back to its uh unix didn't have

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,440
any kind of job control

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,279
in the beginning but it was added by an

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,600
its hacker

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:10,240
who mostly copied the features from its

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
and the little more utility program on

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,799
unix

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,640
is very much a re-implementation of the

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,640
built-in functionality in its

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,520
a little bit more about the new project

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,200
it was started as many of you will know

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,279
by richard stallman

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,399
who was an important its hacker back in

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,360
the six

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,360
back in his 70s

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,679
he was inspired by the its values with

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,919
free software

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,919
free information and sharing

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,640
and actually on the photo is a dover

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,399
printer

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,440
which it's kind of an ignited stallman's

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,080
uh sense of uh

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,720
importance for free software because he

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,240
wanted to

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,679
adapt the dover software but

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
he went to the company who made it and

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,360
they said no you can't have it so

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,080
he was quite mad at that which is why he

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,120
started the

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,120
new products more or less

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,559
well after its was shut down quite a lot

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,200
of people were quite sad but

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,760
something new happened which raised a

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,799
new hope

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,440
for its uh

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,600
an igs hacker wrote a pdp-10 emulator

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,840
and got ideas running on it in the early

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,840
90s

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,840
eventually there was an emulator with

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,640
network support

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,320
so there was a public ids machine

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,200
running on an emulator

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,200
in the early 2000s

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,519
there was some work to make a ready-made

00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,840
disk image to run ids

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,840
called the public ids distribution

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,240
and many tools for working with its

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
files and

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,320
special networking protocols were

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
created

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,000
and on the photo at the bottom is a

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,519
homemade

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,640
fpga computer running and a pdb

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,120
10 implementation which runs

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
ideas

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,600
and finally i started a restoration

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,880
a few years ago which i will

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,880
talk about some more

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
i had access to some its files and later

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
got

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:46,320
access even to the mit archive

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:50,320
of the pdp 10 backup files

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,960
it started small as a project to just

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,640
make a script to install ideas but this

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,760
kind of snowballed and cover

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,799
all aspects of ideas now so i've been

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,120
searching these

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,760
files and tapes to find interesting

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,760
programs

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,080
locate the source code figure out how to

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,360
build it

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,760
and debug them to get them fully running

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,360
which sometimes also means i have to add

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,360
more hardware to the ptp

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:24,320
10 emulators and the photo is an actual

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:28,240
picture of the tape from mit so that's

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,240
how they backed up their files back then

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:39,519
the projects it builds

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:43,120
an its disk image from scratch

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,640
so it starts by boating a few small

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,039
programs

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,760
from a tape virtual emulator tape

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,080
it creates a file system on the disk and

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,679
then

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,039
loads ids itself and a few tools

00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,240
to that disk image

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:06,000
and then the script boats ids

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:11,040
and uses the assembler and compilers to

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,040
build over 300 programs from source code

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,720
myself and a few others volunteers we

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,280
fixed many many bugs in programs

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,919
for example they didn't expect them to

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,960
run in the

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:30,560
in this millennium so we fix many y2k

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,879
bugs and we use modern issue tracking

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,720
and continuous integration

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,720
and put the source code on github

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,480
we still have some important items which

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,079
are not done

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,119
the most important maybe the original

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,560
pdp-6 version of its

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,560
we haven't found it anywhere

00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:02,160
uh the robot simulator through lu

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,520
isn't running yet

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,560
there was this a kind of a real

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,839
sorry re-implementation of its on small

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,240
pdp 11 computer called small its which

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,400
also is not running yet

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,000
and there's always work to do to emulate

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,920
more hardware

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,800
for example there was a kind of a video

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,880
camera and a rubik's arm and some

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:31,200
some some things like that that we'd

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:34,640
like to see running eventually

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:38,079
um the there's a museum in seattle

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,599
called the living computers museum

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,079
uh they contacted me to

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,440
install its on one of their pdp 10

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,400
computers

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,359
so i did some work for them a few years

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,200
ago

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,960
to install its on their computer

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,560
and actually we got it running

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,160
eventually and

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:03,119
it was available from the internet

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,640
until the corona crisis when they shut

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,200
down the museum so it

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,760
it's not running on that computer right

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,680
now

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:17,440
but on an emulator instead

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,119
so that concludes my presentation

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,720
i included some pointers to more

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,440
information

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,480
if you want to learn more there's first

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
of all the

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,000
source code on github there's a

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,839
wiki made by another swedish person

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,320
and my its site is called ids

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,359
pdb10.sc

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,040
and there's a book called hackers which

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,320
has a lot of information about

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:54,960
ideas i'd like just

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:59,680
like to point out that this webpage

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,440
does have some access to its here so for

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,520
example if

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,880
this works now yes so here is one of the

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,320
bitmap raster displays being emulated

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,359
so i can actually log in and use ideas

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,359
from here if i like

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,560
it's a bit slow because it's running on

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,839
a raspberry pi but

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,839
it's working

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,480
so that was all for me

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,000
okay thank you thank you very much so

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,760
uh fascinating and thanks for talk a

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,119
personal note here from me

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,599
uh large introduced me to uh

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,240
the new project ng bill i think in the

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,880
90s

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,000
and it had a huge impact on me so thanks

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,119
for that that

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,280
was a personal reflection on my side uh

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,320
so a couple of questions uh have popped

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,880
up here so

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,040
the first one is uh which i'm going to

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,640
split into a couple so

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,400
bear with us you you're going to stay

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,560
with us for a while here lars

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,119
so what is the best way to get started

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,280
with pdps today

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,720
uh well there's a lot of information

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,839
about pdb10s

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
generally i have some pointers here

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,960
about

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,079
more about ideas specifically and i'd

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,040
say that

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,359
ideas is a very nice way to get started

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,040
with pdp 10 computers because they're

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:31,040
actually very friendly open easy to use

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,280
once you get over the initial hump of

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,760
learning all the new commands of course

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,920
but it's kind of uh it's there for you

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,599
it doesn't have any obstacles

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,920
you can see your files you can change

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,560
your files it's really a

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,839
play thing for anyone who is interested

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,839
in this

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,520
as a follow-up question there what

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,440
emulators to use do you have a list

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,359
somewhere

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,720
um i don't have a list ready-made but

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,520
there are a few and we support its

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,280
running on them

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,280
all so that's

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,320
first of all the kla kl810 computer

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
sorry emulator it's very good for

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,839
running

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,839
its and other operating systems

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,359
and then there's the cmh

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,200
project which added support for pdp tens

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,079
now it actually has support for all the

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,400
processors now so you can have your

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,720
choice

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,240
and and there are also a few fpga

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,800
projects and so on if you're really into

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,800
your hardware

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,800
okay um okay that was a follow-up

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
question there

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,320
about hardware so it's a list for for

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,040
hardware as well

00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:02,160
i guess uh sure there are a lot of lists

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,319
but for

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,440
there's of course information on

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,000
wikipedia

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,960
because it's an uh well-known computer

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,839
so they have a lot of

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,400
information there and i also like to

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,680
mention

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,960
the junkies.org

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,839
sites it sounds strange but maybe i can

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,839
show you here if you would see my screen

00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
share

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,200
i have this wiki a lot of

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,200
information

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,160
so they of course have a lot of

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,880
information

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,200
about pdp 10 computers and hardware

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,319
versions as well

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,960
so there are some intensities who enter

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,359
a lot of

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,839
good information here more than we will

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,760
find on

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,760
wikipedia so i cannot recommend that one

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,680
okay it says here flga

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:08,400
based hardware question mark

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,079
so that's kind of free hardware i i

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,400
don't know what license

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,680
the uh fpga products use

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,680
uh so there are about uh two

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,720
three different ones i can

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,560
i can send out information later so you

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,079
can find out what license i use but i

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,480
don't know

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,480
right now

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
you've been doing a lot of like

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,440
archaeology work here for a while and

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,960
by the way i can highly recommend you

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,480
following large on twitter

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,720
i will provide links uh later on so but

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,000
lars out of all the stuff you've seen

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,640
hardware and software

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
what have impressed you the most like

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,760
considering it's done

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,240
60 years ago officially well there are a

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,440
lot of

00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,560
things that was invented

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,480
with its that we kind of take for

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,000
granted today

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,200
but um i wouldn't

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,280
say anything really stands out as

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,599
that impressing but it's just very

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,160
friendly system

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,079
that's open to exploration and

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,480
programming so that's

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,560
it's very if you like programming it's

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,119
uh very nice to get

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,040
straight access to the hardware even if

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,119
it's just emulated but it's

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
it's kind of a dream machine for

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,079
programmers to play

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,119
around with and a lot of quirky hardware

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,760
that works in

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,640
strange ways that they can explore and

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,640
try if you like

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,160
okay um if the 18

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,839
of the bits were address space what did

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,119
the other 18 bits contain

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,839
instructions and data question mark

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,480
right so the ptp 10 instructions there

00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,800
are always

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:04,160
36 pins there's 36 bits wide

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:08,720
and 18 of those are always the address

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:12,000
and the other 18 are opcode and

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,680
register information so that's kind of

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,680
how they how they designed their

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,359
instruction set back in those days they

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,680
wanted to have

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,280
the full address range inside one

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,240
instruction we don't know that anymore

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,839
because they would be

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,599
very awkward with 64 bit instructions

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,359
always

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,920
but that's that's how they work back

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,680
then and with 18 bit small

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,680
address space it's it still works

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,599
okay and that sums the entire thing up

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,079
so

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,760
i will leave head over to you one so

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,800
thanks and goodbye

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
thank you big thanks and we will be back

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,839
at four

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,839
so see you then

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,480
