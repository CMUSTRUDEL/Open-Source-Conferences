welcome to force north the virtual

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,130
edition we would like to thank all our

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,330
sponsors and partners in this difficult

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,830
situation our gold sponsors look soft

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:20,000
and ansible by Red Hat

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,220
our silver sponsors ITRs group and make

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,900
it right

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,960
our base sponsors

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,150
our partner projects the open source

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,239
community and the region of Gothenburg

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,309
and a huge thanks to our awesome

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,329
community this would not have been

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,329
possible without you

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,610
so this talk is going to be about some

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,230
advice for people who suddenly find

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,949
themselves working from home

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,839
perhaps not voluntarily it's not exactly

00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:00,050
they working remotely talk I would have

00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:02,449
given three months ago but with the

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,330
current circumstances I thought maybe

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,220
this could be helpful I've been working

00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,250
from home for seven years now

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:14,090
more or less and I don't know if I would

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,440
call myself an expert but at least maybe

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,320
I can tell you about some of the

00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:24,800
pitfalls I failed to avoid so first of

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,429
all don't panic working from home can be

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,350
frustrating but it can also be fantastic

00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:32,020
and how you and your team approach it

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,190
makes a huge difference

00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,009
hopefully this advice can make your

00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,899
remote life a little bit easier some of

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,300
this advice is aimed in particular at

00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,819
managers who may find themselves at a

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,179
loss is how to manage people who aren't

00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:49,670
in the same places them and most of it

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:53,989
is actually about someone working in a

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:58,629
team and how you will work and make

00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:58,629
things work in the team

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,540
before I start I also want to mention

00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:09,020
what this talk isn't about I'm not gonna

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,250
give you a list of tools to use

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,990
personally I think it's possible to work

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,850
remotely without relying on any

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,450
particular tool and I don't think

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,750
there's anything that I could say that's

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,150
really critical in fact I think some of

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,100
the tools that are commonly used can be

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,100
a bit detrimental to having a good

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,940
remote working experience but I'll get

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:37,430
more into that later

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:40,110
okay so tip number one get dressed

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,010
start each day by getting up and getting

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,930
dressed this maybe sounds silly but if

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,770
you ever work remotely before I think

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,470
you know what I mean

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,500
it's way too easy to end up staying in

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,030
bed all day staring into a laptop to

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,670
avoid this and a host of other

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,440
potentially awkward situations make sure

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,350
to get dressed as if you were actually

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,360
going to work once you've graduated to

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,180
master level remote worker you can start

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,830
doing the bathrobe and slippers thing

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,830
but I wouldn't recommend starting there

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:18,100
number two commutes started today by

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,930
taking a walk in case you're quarantined

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,990
do some stretches or meditate or

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,820
exercise but get your blood pumping and

00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,840
make sure that your body is awake before

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,840
you start working

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,090
tip number three eat breakfast

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,550
don't start skipping meals or living on

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,950
snacks in candy since you're not having

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,650
to commute or go out for lunch make this

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,610
an opportunity to cook proper meals make

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,230
a meal plan make food and above all take

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:55,580
the chance to get away from the computer

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:58,200
when eating number four plan your day

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,560
sitting at home with lots to do and no

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,940
one to talk to you can be overwhelming

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,860
one trick that's worked wonders for me

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,860
is to start each day by writing down a

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,080
to-do list for today just a simple list

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,340
of things I want to need to do that day

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,940
each day a new list this really helps to

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,169
calm you down

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:25,440
and focus on fine take breaks set a

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:28,380
timer get up and stretch again take

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,780
walks or exercise I think you can start

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,460
to see the theme here the tricky part

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,440
about working from home is that the

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,870
breaks that happen organically when

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,669
you're in an office you now have to make

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,140
happen yourself take a full lunch break

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,660
take a double lunch break and go for a

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,690
walk and get some Sun while you have the

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,690
chance

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,690
make rituals build habits when having a

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,390
coffee take a break away from the

00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,680
computer don't end up drinking 15 comes

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,390
to coffee while hammering away as a

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,790
keyboard ending up with an ulcer

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,350
I bought a French press and starting

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,140
grinding my own beans just to make the

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,520
process a bit slower and to give me some

00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,460
time away from the computer

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,350
I'm calling this make rituals because I

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,960
think we're under Elling the benefit of

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,960
patterns to help us building good habits

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,130
seven time to come connect working from

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,410
home can make you invisible to others

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,810
and it can make you feel invisible it

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,600
can be a lonely experience but it

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,040
doesn't have to be make sure to check in

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,350
with your teammates regularly and

00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,600
schedule one-to-one meetings or chats

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,940
not too many you don't want to waste

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,100
your time or their time make sure to

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,630
spend some time each day exchanging

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,630
small talk with someone on your team

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,080
a dedicated space if you can make sure

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,180
that you can close the door to your

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,580
office and shout out any other people

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,800
who might be at home with you if you

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,360
can't have a discussion with those who

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,610
share your home about respecting each

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,320
other's space use headphones and

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,740
curtains whatever tools you have

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,330
available this isn't always doable but

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,340
think about what you can do to separate

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,820
your home office from your life outside

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,820
of work

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,210
but except the distractions if you are

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,670
sharing your home

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,490
there will be distractions just accept

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,950
this don't stress not so you won't be

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,200
100% productive look you weren't that

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,580
productive at the office either but the

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,700
interruptions used films like work

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,340
because you're at work take a break play

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,900
with the kids it's okay

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,870
working from home also means not having

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,940
to adhere strictly to office hours maybe

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,560
9:00 to 5:00 just doesn't work when the

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,900
kids aren't in school and you're sharing

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,520
your home office maybe working a few

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,580
hours in the morning and a few hours in

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,320
the evening would make more sense remote

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,060
work allows you to experiment with

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,070
fitting your work schedule to your life

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,070
instead of faking your life around work

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,090
think a synchronous it's tempting to

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,219
become overly reliant on team meetings

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,779
when working from home at first this

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:15,270
seems like a great idea but it can

00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,860
quickly get stressful allow your

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,520
colleagues to go off the radar to

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,779
actually get work done and do the same

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,699
this I think is the biggest difference

00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,189
between working in an office and working

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,870
remotely if your colleagues are spread

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,229
across the planet and time zones it

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,270
becomes even more crucial at first it's

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,430
easy to feel guilty about not being in a

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,009
meeting what if everyone else thinks I'm

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,159
slacking off I mean what if I am

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:43,199
slacking off for managers letting go can

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,889
be a challenge what if everyone is

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,889
slacking off trust me this isn't as much

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,240
of a problem as it may seem at first

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,039
after a while you realize that it's

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,719
actually just as he's disliked off in an

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,719
office if that's what you wanted you

00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:04,599
really no meetings video conferencing

00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:06,550
really isn't that great it's not the

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,099
same as a real meeting and it eats up a

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,840
lot of time and energy one of the great

00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:12,539
benefits of working remotely is being

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,849
able to control your own schedule

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,979
embrace that having a focused meeting to

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:19,240
work out a particular issue is fine but

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,900
daily status for example

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,370
I don't recommend it now this point in

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,930
particular is one that I think is going

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,020
to be difficult for people used to

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,509
working in office to accept managers

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,550
love meetings scrum is all about

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:36,519
meanings how can me this be something

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,169
netiquette negative it seems to me like

00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,459
everyone's first instinct is starting to

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,050
work remotely is to reach for a

00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,550
videoconference solution and schedule as

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,019
much meeting time as possible in a

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,720
desperate attempt to make remote work

00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,940
seem just like being in an office this

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,820
is a bad idea it's gonna stress everyone

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,829
out I'm not saying you kind of meetings

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:59,529
at all but consider other possible

00:08:53,829 --> 00:09:00,880
solutions make sure everyone's heard all

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:03,220
right sometimes you do need to do a

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,870
conference call in virtual meetings it's

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,829
easy for some people to disappear and

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,209
just sit quietly due to delays and

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,220
latencies interrupting each other is

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,399
either happy non-stop or no one dares to

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,220
speak because everyone else is afraid of

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,870
interrupting therefore every meeting

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,420
should have a moderator who makes sure

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,940
everyone gets to speak this takes all

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,670
practice to be honest online meetings

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,120
just aren't great it's better to try to

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,120
avoid them

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,179
make it pings and naked ping is when you

00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:36,769
come back to your chat client after

00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,879
being out for lunch and you see one of

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:43,009
your colleagues who left your message

00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:45,230
the message is are you there or hi now

00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,609
this is basic chat hygiene but it has a

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,470
lot more important when working from

00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:49,999
home if you want to ask your colleague

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,919
question don't you say hello

00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:56,029
don't say ping don't say are you there

00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:58,669
just ask the question they will answer

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:02,290
when they see it again embrace the

00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:05,449
synchronous nature nature of remote work

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,040
over communicate let your colleagues

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,999
know what you're doing and make sure you

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,939
know what they are doing

00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,889
check in and check out make sure to

00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:15,319
notify them if you take a break and when

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,299
you sign off for the day keep connected

00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:22,279
but without requiring everyone to be in

00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:23,869
sync and finally stop working when I

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,970
started working from home the comment I

00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:27,589
got most often was oh I couldn't do that

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,809
I just stand up playing video games all

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,720
day or I wouldn't get anything done

00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:34,699
something like that in my experience the

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,439
opposite is true when working from home

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:38,660
the boundary between working time and

00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:41,089
personal time gets blurry make sure you

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,040
stop working in the evening don't fall

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,259
into the trap of working non-stop

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,769
turn off your work computer and step

00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,769
away from your desk

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:58,040
and that's it okay so I have a question

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,800
this is Henrik so thanks for now the a

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,170
questionnaire when it comes to meetings

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,710
we have a rule in my team to do

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,480
stand-ups in a dedicated chat a sync is

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,130
important when working from home

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,260
do you agree it can be so my experience

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,870
is with a remote team where everyone is

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,140
in a different time zone and that makes

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,840
having a stand up every day especially

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,960
challenging but it's also the case so

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,410
right now it's kind of a special time

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,990
for working remotely where everyone is

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,890
kind of at home instead of traveling but

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,930
if you're working remotely other times

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,580
people would be travelling perhaps or in

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,200
different locations and having everyone

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,000
ready to sit down for a meeting at

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,300
exactly the same time becomes a

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,490
challenge so personally I found find

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,550
that the daily standup

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:56,750
becomes less valuable when working

00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:05,500
remotely but again right now is kind of

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:08,930
a special difficult situation thank you

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,750
so we're getting this screen set up for

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,210
the next speaker I can tell the the

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,010
speakers that we get applauses is one in

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,080
the in the comments on YouTube which you

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,830
unfortunately cannot see live but you

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,590
have to go in there and get an ego trip

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:29,330
I see we have more questions up do you

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:32,120
want to do them Henrik questions slash

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:36,200
tips okay

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,810
sorry I had miss here so should you use

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,230
the phone if you quickly need questions

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:47,330
answered Oh what would be the equivalent

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:50,600
to walk into to their desk yeah I think

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:53,270
using the fall or just a video

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,960
conference call or a call over the

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,150
Internet

00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,810
between two people can be very valuable

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,640
where you can have a direct conversation

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:04,399
face to face and speak

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,790
of course I think it's valuable to try

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,440
to limit that because if you need your

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,940
question answered you need to interrupt

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,310
what someone else is doing and maybe

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,010
they're not ready to handle that at the

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,810
moment so I think this is not that

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,279
different from the office it can be very

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,779
frustrating if you are the one person

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,310
that everyone needs to ask questions so

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,690
you constantly get people coming in and

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,990
knocking on your door to your office

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,000
so just you see a common sense but yes I

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,040
think if you're gonna have meetings

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,870
having this focused one-to-one meeting

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,870
