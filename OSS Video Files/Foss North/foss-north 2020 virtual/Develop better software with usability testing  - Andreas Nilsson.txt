welcome to force north the virtual

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,130
edition we would like to thank all our

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,330
sponsors and partners in this difficult

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,830
situation our gold sponsors look soft

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:20,000
and ansible by Red Hat

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,220
our silver sponsors ITRs group and make

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,900
it right

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,960
our base sponsors

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,150
our partner projects the open source

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,239
community and the region of Gothenburg

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,220
and a huge thanks to our awesome

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:42,100
community this would not have been

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:45,390
possible without you hello my name is

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:49,420
Andreas Nilsson I work as a UX designer

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,190
Red Hat's and today I want to talk about

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,030
something called use a bit of testing a

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,330
short introduction so I often get asked

00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:01,900
what is the number one thing I can do to

00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:06,930
make my open source projects better

00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:10,510
design and a key in in my mind is

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,750
usability testing so yeah now I'm gonna

00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,250
give this up for 10 minutes and talk

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,840
about how you can start doing these

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:22,510
tests in your own source project so use

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,570
a bit of testing at its core is simply a

00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,909
test of your software where someone who

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:32,980
hasn't used your software before sits

00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:35,500
down and tests it while you take notes

00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,880
and while the rest of your software

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,950
development team observes but let's take

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,640
a step back first and talk about the

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:53,010
sign and what is that and for me design

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:59,020
is the rendering of intense and you know

00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:02,170
and a good design is to communicate them

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,150
intend well and in order to do that you

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,330
have to give people the tools that

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,000
allows them to make good decisions and

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,209
use your your software rates which

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,530
enjoyment and ease and as little

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:23,879
frustration as possible and I would say

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:26,500
this everybody designs it could be the

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,780
simple things in your software it could

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,819
be you know it's everything it's the

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,830
order you design if you display things

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,310
and it's every single little color

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,620
choice every individual word in your

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,209
software it could be things like

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,069
how much time does it take to load a

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:48,080
screen and what do you communicate

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:50,030
during the loading time or it could be

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,970
able to be other things maybe you design

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,680
a you build an API like how how do

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,420
people use up what kind of learning view

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,739
using that API is it internally

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,420
consistent so in my mind everyone on a

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,180
separate development team needs to get

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,370
better at the side and a really quick

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,250
way to get better quickly better better

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,200
fast is to get to know your users and

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:20,209
one of the best methods of doing that is

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:22,519
which uses things like so the free

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:26,720
formations of music better testing are

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,150
the one and a half and in a test we have

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,480
three distinct roles we have a moderator

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,700
we we have the participant and the

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,280
moderator gives some tasks stay silent

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,670
most at a time and helps out only if

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,650
needed

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,440
the participant is the person that tests

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,799
the software and do so while thinking

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,540
out loud again it's testing the software

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,940
it's not testing with people it's

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,489
testing the software and then the team

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,680
is there to observe only but it's

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,139
critical that they are there because

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,450
again everybody decides everyone on the

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:03,739
team takes the small decision that ends

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,900
up being this offer so who are we in the

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,879
test weights again we're testing the

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,180
soccer or not testing anyone's

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,410
particular skills about using software

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,989
and everyone needs to be reminded about

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,359
that part in particular to participants

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,250
you need to tell them we are testing the

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
software we're not testing you because

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,250
people are very self-aware I love their

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,449
skills and you know they work done with

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,060
public and making a fool out of the

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:32,479
cells so in order to do that we need to

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,210
recruit participants and these could be

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,669
you know future your source of your

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,010
software you know the people that ask

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:48,289
closely matches the target audience to

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:49,370
does Hocker as possible so ideally you

00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,060
want people who haven't used your

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,630
software before who doesn't come in with

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,430
predetermine ocean and it's usually okay

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:03,160
to start with only a handful of people

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:06,820
we use assess a five six people and you

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,530
can run these tests you know as with as

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,620
many people as you want but as it soon

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,180
as I start seeing repetitive that you

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,970
know like people keep running into the

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,620
same issues over and over again it's

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,350
time to make a change it's time to

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,950
change your softer a little bit and then

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,750
test with new people after out and you

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,290
need to be smart with who you test to it

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,420
so for example my project that I spent

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,670
most of the time working on the cockpit

00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,640
perfect interactive web console for

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,400
reddit Enterprise Linux and other

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,800
linux's our core audience is system

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,050
administrators so we want to test widows

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,510
and we we do want to test a subset of

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,730
those administrators so for example we

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,790
will test with with new system and storm

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,580
system ins that are maybe senior sis

00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,990
administer their mutual Linux so if we

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,330
can get one of those that's the very

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,950
best well we could also test wait

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:05,830
developers we would get not as good

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,560
results but we still get some answers if

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,040
we would test with postman we would

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,380
begin you know kind of a good results we

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,660
would get some stuff out of it but you

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,750
know we wouldn't get as good aerosols as

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,430
possible we counts we would get terrible

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,740
results because you can't make them sit

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,810
still or interact with a computer but

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,570
it's one group that is worse than cats

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,520
and that is your co-workers because your

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,610
co-workers have the same disadvantages

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,770
as you do which is that they know too

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,660
much about the backend so just like you

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,740
it can fill in the blanks way too often

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,110
and they also know that we're to go to

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,280
jargon of the language and that

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,560
particular quirks

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,330
so you do not want to test with DOS you

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,760
want like final new things so that's why

00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:00,460
I need to keeping in mind who who you

00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:02,620
test to it so then when you test so you

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,810
test it as early as we can because

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,650
that's when it's least expensive that's

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:12,370
when it's

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:15,100
as with as little risk as possible if

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,720
it's only idea it's way too early if

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,290
it's already in production it's way too

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,290
late but anywhere in between you test

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:27,639
these things and you can get different

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:30,639
things of the test depending on when you

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,160
run it for example when you only have

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,800
wireframe you can test that interactive

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,139
ability but you also haven't put too

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,490
much effort into it so far so it's

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:44,110
you're quick to change and when you have

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,530
a group get branch you can start testing

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,570
things like building times you know when

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:55,900
when do people look at that at a screen

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:58,960
and say oh I think it's crashed and then

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,870
the we come to know how how do you test

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,220
test it if it's something like web

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:08,970
surfer it's easy because with open

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,820
source projects that are usually like

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:15,070
remotes you have distributed teams you

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,590
can actually just do a video call you

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,800
can ask the participant to share their

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,200
screen I remember it's participant the

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,310
dusta talking but how do you how do you

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,590
make sure that they get the right

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,500
software if it's something like web base

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,450
offer it against and just how I work out

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,070
it's a web-based thing so I get to just

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,070
host it somewhere and then give them a

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:39,190
URL ask them to share their screen and

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,839
get going but if it's something like a

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,190
client that maybe it's SEO like tool

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,529
well you can strip them a docker

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,950
container and ask them to run that or

00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,110
maybe it's a piece of EXO suffer you can

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,520
[Music]

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:57,010
ask them to run a application container

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,959
such as a flat pack or something similar

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:04,959
so then we come to the extra tests just

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,320
like I do now they share their suite and

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,450
do the talking and the moderator the

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,600
person that asks the questions gives the

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,079
tasks to carry out would you to talk in

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,190
and also has their video on same for the

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,329
participants but they also have their

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,459
screen sharing

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:28,439
than a team stay silent because it's

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:31,660
very easy for a team to to break in to -

00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:34,329
yeah you know they need to say solvent

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,610
and only observed so far and then that's

00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:40,179
very young they have the opportunity to

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:43,269
ask questions so again the moderator

00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:45,429
does the asking can be the help ping if

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,980
the participant a sick scream is stuck

00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:50,319
then you know they just know de down and

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,660
say maybe you should try this one so we

00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,879
can get move on move on with the test

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,269
and try the other things the participant

00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,819
does most of talking speaking out loud

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:03,249
but should not ask for any help and if

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:05,259
they do the moderator should not help

00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:08,399
them and then steam should mostly be

00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:10,899
listening and they should be talking and

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,929
then how many times should you run well

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,850
you sure don't were on a handful there's

00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:18,610
no magic number you should draw more and

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,230
more tests you should fix the issues

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,230
they come up and usually run the tests

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,059
again and you will learn more about the

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,290
stuff you're doing where you able

00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:33,369
actually able to find the stuff that was

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:36,790
in there you know keep keep building new

00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:40,269
stuff test them build something new test

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,619
it again that's my 10 minutes awesome

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:49,059
thank you very much

00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:49,839
so Henry yes hi this is Henry a question

00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:53,649
from the audience

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,860
are you using tools to do tests remotely

00:10:53,649 --> 00:11:00,009
or do you do all in all testing in

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,879
person ah sorry this was a little bit

00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:06,249
unclear so I only ever do all my testing

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,579
remotely as I have a remote team which

00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:12,850
is the same setup that a lot of open

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:17,049
source project tab so we always do a

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:20,999
video meeting and then we have the all

00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:22,720
the people dialing in all the all day

00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,999
muttering that I'll say in the

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,709
participant thylacine and the entire

00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:29,079
team

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:31,440
Dallas in for observation so we always

00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,910
do it remotely and

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,970
it's also good because then we can also

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,760
record it and someone is unable to make

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,440
that meetings very simple but it's

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,120
definitely possible to do it in person

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:48,360
as well then you just you know you set

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,710
things up in a room you invite someone

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,550
over and okay you know it's a suit

00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,550
