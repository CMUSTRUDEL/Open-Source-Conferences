welcome to force north the virtual

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,950
edition we would like to thank all our

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,000
sponsors and partners in this difficult

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,500
situation our gold sponsors look soft

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,670
and ansible by Red Hat

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,900
our silver sponsors ITRs group and make

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,570
it right

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,630
our base sponsors

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,789
our partner projects the open source

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,910
community and the region of Gothenburg

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,980
and a huge thanks to our awesome

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,960
community this would not have been

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,790
possible without you so welcome back I'd

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,769
like to introduce you to Ashley and

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,250
gotten from make it right who will talk

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:53,470
about robotic process automation so the

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:56,410
stage is yours good afternoon it's

00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,160
actually quite early for me here in

00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:04,809
California in the epicenter of chaos in

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,649
the world for now I wanted to talk today

00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:11,039
about the history of application

00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:15,550
automation and the relationship between

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:17,110
open source and closed solutions my name

00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,860
is Ashley rich Airy I'm here with my

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:24,750
colleague plq Jerome who is the director

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:29,670
at make it right and I am the newly

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,650
joined CTO I am a serial entrepreneur

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,590
with multiple startups in my history

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:42,250
some successful some not so much

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:45,340
but I am new to the RP a part of the

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,930
business with make it right but I do

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:52,710
have a significant amount of history and

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:56,380
I was there kind of feelings about

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,979
testing and test automation early in my

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:02,860
career I wrote airplane controller

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:05,409
software aircraft engine controller

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,729
software and other types of safety

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:14,530
critical systems and so my relationship

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:17,010
with QA as an engineering discipline is

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,280
a little bit different than a typical

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,220
web platform developer we had to have

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,900
100% test coverage in the host

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,380
environments and a way in which we

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:33,180
tested was prescribed by government

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,760
standards but those standards actually

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,459
made it possible to innovate and build a

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:44,400
lot of really cool technology around

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:49,390
the tests and automation of those tests

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,900
but as I joined make it right and we

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,720
began to develop a new version of our

00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:02,280
platform one of the key insights we had

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:06,400
was that both the RP a market and the

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,280
test automation market are very similar

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,579
and they have a very similar set of

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,370
technologies at the heart of them and a

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:19,659
similar set of use cases at the heart of

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,819
them and for us the thing that makes the

00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:25,359
future of RP a and test automation

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:30,400
exciting is the way in which it will

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:32,319
enable a new application of skills that

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,709
have been developed in one area of

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,920
engineering the test automation fields

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,019
but bringing major impact into another

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,449
area of the business which is a business

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:50,129
process automation so let's take a

00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:53,709
little tour down memory lane if we can

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:56,739
but in the early days of applications

00:03:53,709 --> 00:04:00,579
we're talking about ms-dos it's still

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,379
not actually the earliest days but we're

00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,980
talking in the time period here of

00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:09,760
Microsoft having some dominance windows

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,549
coming out not long after and there were

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,150
vendors that develop very closed

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:20,380
proprietary systems to do automated

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,659
testing and you know back in 1990 there

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,370
wasn't really this history of

00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:29,020
collaborative community style

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,199
programming there was collaboration but

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,560
it really was kind of closer in the

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,300
academic communities and not so much in

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,490
the commercial communities I think in

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,210
1990 the idea that you would give you

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,539
software away in a commercial setting

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,370
was still considered a little bit

00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:51,800
radical

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,520
one of the little tidbits that I

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,560
uncovered as I was doing some research

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:03,949
to prepare for this talk was that the

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,680
selenium name which actually in in real

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:11,539
life the element is uh is a cure for

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,870
mercury poisoning and so when they were

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:17,810
working on the selenium open source

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:21,380
browser testing framework they were

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:25,070
making kind of a swipe at the very

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:30,860
dominant closed solutions that were on

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:35,270
the market at the time and then we move

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:39,050
forward in almost a decade and what an

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,449
application is has changed entirely we

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:45,229
moved from applications that are hosted

00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:48,110
in operating systems that have very

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:51,110
closed environments you can't run a an

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,930
application that was built for Linux or

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:58,789
for other operating systems on Windows

00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,650
and you can't run the same browsers to a

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,039
world where everything is in the browser

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:08,030
and the browser is king and the internet

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:11,690
is driving functionality all throughout

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:16,130
the early years of the 2000s but as we

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:19,219
know by late 2000s the the phone became

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:23,539
our primary source for application

00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:29,030
interactions and the phone systems also

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:32,479
had closed test frameworks being built

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:37,310
and test tools being built but in 2011

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:41,150
we have the launch of fully open set of

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:44,570
tools referred to as appium and this

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:50,870
really begins to enable the ability to

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:53,750
do frequent and long-running regression

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,900
testing managing the the test

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,360
environments on multiple devices is the

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,739
real challenge and trying to do that in

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,529
closed

00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,999
system really limits one's ability to

00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,819
support all the different types of

00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:11,179
devices and environments if those

00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,179
devices

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:20,070
and at the same time we saw an evolution

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,950
in the proprietary markets over the

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,380
course of that decade many mergers and

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,410
acquisitions later some of the earliest

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,640
players in automation and test

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:38,070
automation have their products evolving

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:43,050
into the beginnings of this market that

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:49,520
we now call our PA and as Hart what our

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:53,300
PA is is a way of sequentially

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,100
automating away the rote tasks that

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,660
humans in call centers and customer

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,090
support centers and claims processing

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:05,880
centers are doing which often involve

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:10,170
very direct interpretation of input data

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:13,380
and then following a written script to

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:15,780
determine where to put that data and how

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,550
to fill out some other system another

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,870
use case we've come across quite

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,080
frequently is literally copy pasting

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,720
data from one legacy IT system into

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,630
another legacy IT system so you might

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,850
have one system that has some kind of

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,040
ticket and there are pieces of

00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,950
information in that ticket but this

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,810
system is not continued to be evolving

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,310
and so there's no way to build an API

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:48,060
from that system to your new CRM and so

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:52,170
you have folks agents who are reading

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,440
data or tickets or input paperwork and

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,650
then entering that data into another

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,130
system and the tools that had been

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:05,880
previously used primarily to test all of

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:10,320
the different ways of entering data are

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,050
now being asked to using AI and other

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,710
object recognition techniques to

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:20,160
automatically record those processes and

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:25,770
generate user behavior and

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:29,190
for us we see this as not so different

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:34,050
than the revolution that began to occur

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:36,540
as applications move away from hosted

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,140
environments where you operate your

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:43,290
entire infrastructure and you have

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,560
regular releases to a model where we

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,900
have continuous deployment into the

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,850
clouds and so we have an entire

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:55,340
discipline of site reliability

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:59,610
engineering begin to open up into

00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:03,090
building tools to automate automate away

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,580
the chores of their work everyone in

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,200
engineering tends to like to do the

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,870
creative work and so if we find

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,740
ourselves doing repetitive work we start

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:19,020
to write scripts to solve that for us so

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:23,370
there's this convergence of DevOps style

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:26,940
technology test automation continuous

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,970
delivery and an opportunity to take

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,080
those tool sets and integrate them into

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:37,380
the shadow IT environments the legacy IT

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:40,860
environments the the the large contact

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:44,880
center environment but we believe that

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,510
the the only way that the markets for

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,810
this technology and the the opportunity

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,300
that this technology represents both to

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,420
optimize costs but also to to reduce

00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,620
errors when you have thousands of

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:04,560
individuals using their fantastic

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,330
ability to make decisions but they're

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,310
making the same decision over and over

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,200
again it's very easy for a small error

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,450
to be introduced and for that to have

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,880
significant financial consequences so

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,900
when you can automate those types of

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:23,520
tasks obviously you're going to be

00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:27,240
reducing that error but our key focus is

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,640
on having a platform that enables the

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,040
open source community to be able to take

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,290
the skills that they already have we

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,079
have these

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:39,259
new dominant open source frameworks in

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,829
test regression environments and in

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:46,250
automation environments and to leverage

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:51,800
those skills to provide value in the

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:54,800
rest of the business so as we evolve our

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,350
AI capabilities we have a commitment to

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,220
make sure that we continue to be

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,529
compatible and perhaps to work with

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,470
other companies on a standard that

00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:10,790
enables robotic process automation to be

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:14,949
as open as technologies like JavaScript

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,949
and HTML and HTTP

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:23,300
yeah so I would just add a few few notes

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,580
from my side here so I move my key right

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,390
from almost the beginning of the company

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:33,100
so Ashley went through the history of

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,630
tools and we see how how this history

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,580
impacted the place where we are as a

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,839
make it right right now but also where

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,420
the market is so when we talk about the

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,510
robotic process automation I don't know

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,460
how much this this is these name

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,680
resonates on the open-source community

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,570
right now but when you talk about when

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,430
you talk with the business people they

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,500
hear they hear it like all the time

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,440
because it is like hundreds of millions

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,600
spent on the Google arts and other means

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,680
of marketing to get to the business

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,940
people not open-source community we've

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,040
even used that there is like a new

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,830
technology and something something

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,440
amazing happen that can solve all the

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,660
pains for business people with the

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,990
legacy technologies and with the

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:23,029
complexity of the systems and from

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:28,670
business perspective lack of quick

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:30,800
progress of of IDE teams so that's their

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,830
perspective but our perspective has

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,750
actually shown a bit a history is that

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,110
actually we are talking about the tools

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,880
that are there like for 20 or 25 years

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,700
and open-source community especially

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:51,650
selenium users or or auto IT users or

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:54,080
this this kind of tools users community

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:57,290
they're like doing that for years it's

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,390
like nothing new it's just it's a

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:03,200
different place where we put our scripts

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,209
that do the job there is some a bit more

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,890
stricter rules about deploying the

00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,720
scripts and testing and everything but

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,529
in terms of technologies exactly the

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,560
same so when we look at their p market

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:20,120
it's it's crowded with the commercial

00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:22,850
tools dedicated for a specific set of

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,860
skills claiming that people from the

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,710
business can create the robots but

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,060
actually when and that's what we do with

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:33,140
right and with with our teams of

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,950
experienced people in open source

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,380
community open source tools they're like

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,470
you know they are rock stars when we

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,300
come to air PA deployments those guys

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,930
that have an experience doing test

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,510
automation things they're like you know

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,850
really killing killing killing the

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,580
challenges and just doing great great

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,680
job on the robotic process automation

00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,339
typical deployment so what we find out

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,050
with with our with our experience that

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,600
actually there is no tool on the market

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,480
no platform the market or even no mean

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,670
on the market to put the best tools we

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,270
have in open source communities on this

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:18,860
typical commercial like commercial light

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:20,930
deployments and well actually join our

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,110
team to create the new version of the

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,050
product and the current platform we have

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,300
is like giving this opportunity giving

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,720
the giving this capability to open

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:35,959
source community to actually open for

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,560
your for yourself and completely new

00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,589
area of using your skills your expertise

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,029
and talking the business language

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:49,250
delivering a completely new new value

00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:53,300
out of something that actually we all

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:57,110
are proficient at and we are doing that

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,860
for four years so I think the the thing

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:03,760
we want to reiterate is this idea that

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:06,709
you know the interoperability of

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,589
different RPA automation systems is

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:12,500
going to become the central most

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:15,110
important element of any automation

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,740
system having a closed environment where

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,040
your automation software only works on a

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:25,100
specific tool set then means that the

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,800
development community who is supporting

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,899
the maintenance and creation and

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,209
operation of all of those different

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:34,640
robots whether the robots job is to

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,860
simulate user behavior and generate

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,560
regression test data or whether the

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,449
robots job is to actually perform work

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,019
for a

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:48,019
this contact center the the need to have

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,720
three or four different technical skill

00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:54,169
sets in order to be viable in that

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,419
marketplace it limits the the pace of

00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:58,339
innovation that we can have in this part

00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:01,009
of the industry so we're heading for

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,869
this point where without

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:04,880
interoperability standards between

00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:07,309
automated solutions and the only way we

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,539
can do that is through open source you

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,939
know we've seen it time and time again

00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:14,899
in every part of technology advancement

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:17,870
that the benefits of remaining open that

00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:21,260
you know it's not just a lofty idea it's

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:23,870
not just for the good of the community

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,089
it's actually the only way that the

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,570
community and the technology can thrive

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,340
and grow you can imagine there was a

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,110
time when you had to write five

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,600
different versions of JavaScript in

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,750
order to guarantee that your application

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,070
could be used on the Internet

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:45,590
and we can't have that happen in the

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,870
automation market is very important that

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,200
all of the vendors continue to try to

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:55,870
focus and support the development of

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,870
standards and open solutions

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:06,950
thank you very much okay so this is

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:12,830
Henrik so there's a couple of questions

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:15,920
are you prepared are you ready now the

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,160
most interesting part yeah talk I

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,320
managed to actually unmute myself before

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,420
starting with the questions okay how do

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,820
you communicate and/or work together

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:30,890
with the open source project you're

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:35,270
using so we're in the early days I

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:37,850
believe that by open sourcing our own

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:41,600
software and establishing community

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:44,750
additions of that software trying to

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,200
create open communities through weather

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:52,390
as you know user slack or discord

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:58,280
environments which be even more open or

00:18:52,390 --> 00:19:00,530
providing free learning resources you

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,650
know we're we are an older company that

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,990
has been very successful in our corner

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,110
of Europe and we have a large number of

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,870
financial and insurance oriented

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:16,340
customers but we're now kind of doing an

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:18,440
internal startup reboot of both our

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,370
platform and our service offering

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,860
so this traditional history we you know

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,990
we come from a community of open source

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,320
developers the robots themselves have

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,960
always been in terms of the delivery

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,050
that we do have always been written in

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,480
open source frameworks and now we're

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,060
trying to make our platform capable of

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,860
enabling that support for open source as

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,330
well so you know that that really just

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,960
comes down to making sure that we're

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:51,200
compatible and that we contribute to

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,030
that community hopefully by you know

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
contributing to the source code as well

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,840
in the base

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,400
okay next question

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,380
do you see cost savings from using open

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:10,010
source or is it more about time to

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:12,970
market or perhaps both because that's a

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:16,190
very good question and we face it like a

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,700
lot also when talking with with the

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,160
customers so in case in in specific use

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,850
case when we're talking today which is

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,730
robotic process automation open source

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:32,800
like straightaway using open source

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:35,930
gives you the savings in in the way of

00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,750
actually getting proper people

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:41,150
experienced people to do to do the work

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,730
actually so when we talk about their PA

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:48,350
the main cost like 80 percent of the

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,720
cost sometimes even more is is actually

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:54,050
actually the work you need to do to set

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,730
up the robot to maintain the robot and

00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:00,170
make sure that it's working properly and

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,840
if we use open source for it and we use

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:06,230
the the for example the experts for a

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,960
selenium to do it we get that job done

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,820
like you know sometimes it's even three

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,090
or four times faster so that's like

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:17,480
immediate safe and of course the second

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:20,090
part is related to to the cost of the

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,920
lines so when we compare the cost of the

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,100
open source to the commercial tools of

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,010
course we the dancer is obvious but then

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,380
you know especially enterprise customers

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,240
they are asking for some kind of

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,740
enterprise grade support and this is

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,700
something that make it right is

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,680
delivering with its platform so

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,980
definitely there are big savings in

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,040
terms of pure money but long term it's

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,470
is also in terms of you know costing

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,810
maintenance the the quality of the

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:55,010
results we deliver all those things we

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,360
see that it's it's by far superior to to

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,560
let's say the typical commercial

00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,560
approach to the subject

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,139
okay and with that I leave the

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,539
microphone to you one the virtual

00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:12,879
microphone yeah thank you thank you

00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,879
everyone for for talking em for viewing

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,599
and with that I would like to thank our

00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:21,049
speakers our sponsors and all our

00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,049
viewers
