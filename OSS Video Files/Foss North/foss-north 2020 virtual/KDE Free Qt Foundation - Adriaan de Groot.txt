Adrian the stage is yours Thank You

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,330
Johan

00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,230
it's good to be here although I'm

00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:02,430
missing being there in göteborg with you

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,160
all - everyone tuning in live hi have

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,780
you here my name is Adrian and I'm gonna

00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,480
be talking about the KDE free cute

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,610
foundation I'm going to keep this fairly

00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,409
short it's maybe a half hour or so and

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,940
I'm gonna start my talk with a whole

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,680
bunch of disclaimers see this is sort of

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,450
kind of a licensing talk I'm going to be

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,200
talking about licenses and permissions

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,670
granted but on software by various

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,350
entities but I'm not a lawyer and if I

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,840
was a lawyer I wouldn't be your lawyer

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,149
so this is not legal advice and any

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,430
licensing decisions you take are your

00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,920
own responsibilities please be

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,409
responsible when dealing with licenses

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,479
and speaking of licenses you should have

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,310
listened to the previous talk by Gabriel

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,640
which was all about getting your

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,460
licensing information right so that's my

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,719
legal disclaimer then I'm gonna tell you

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,329
this is gonna be a little bit of a

00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,710
history talk I'm gonna talk about good

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,680
the good old days and maybe tell people

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,359
to get off my lawn remember the past is

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,490
a different country and the way we look

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,320
at free software nowadays is somewhat

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,490
different from the way we did 20 years

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,830
ago and as we've noticed this month the

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,709
world is never changing place you never

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,549
know what's going to come next

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:27,109
I'm also talking about other people's

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:31,890
work this isn't stuff that I personally

00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:34,319
put a lot of effort into don't think

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,590
that I'm taking credit for other

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,139
people's work really the people to thank

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,810
around the KTV free cute Foundation are

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:48,750
Martin and Olaf I'll mention them again

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,579
later so those were my disclaimers let's

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,730
move on to the title of this talk

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,970
because it's got a bunch of words in

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,879
there that's probably bear a little

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,040
explanation let's start with KDE it's

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,349
the KDE free cute foundation well KDE is

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,889
a community a worldwide community that

00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,419
makes a whole bunch of software

00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:10,049
frameworks plasma applications we used

00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,650
to call it

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:15,239
KDE as a desktop environment we don't do

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,840
that anymore

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,419
we have slightly more nuanced names for

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,889
the software we do but we're a large

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:28,739
free software community that makes free

00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,590
software remember that's free as in

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,209
freedom and not free as in beer

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,319
we believe in the four freedoms as

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,090
defined by the free software foundation

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,989
and supported by the free thought

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,829
Software Foundation Europe KDE builds on

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,019
all kinds of free software foundations

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:50,659
and mostly it uses a free software

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,799
toolkit and that toolkit is cute cute

00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,959
probably well known to many people in

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,840
göteborg because it gets used in so many

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,699
industrial applications cute is a

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,489
toolkit for creating user interfaces

00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:06,629
it's both cross and multi-platform

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,659
cross-platform in the sense that it runs

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:12,259
on all the free software operating

00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:15,229
systems that you want like freebsd linux

00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:18,750
opensolaris it also runs on a bunch of

00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:21,720
proprietaries operating systems and it

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,240
runs up and down the stack desktops

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,400
laptops and mobile devices as well and

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,169
embedded

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,870
the Katy free cute foundation is moving

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:36,150
on the last word in the title here it's

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,250
a foundation that that is to say it's an

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,510
independent organization independent of

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,150
KDE itself independent of cute it lives

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:49,880
on its own and the reason for that is

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:53,570
that we need we don't want it to be

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,320
- Oh anything - kte or too cute it

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,210
should be beholden to neither and live

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:04,460
its own life because it has its own

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:07,730
purpose this free cute foundation why

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,520
and what is this well we need to look at

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:15,130
the old days a little bit of history of

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:18,560
cute and this is this is condensed down

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,020
if you want more details Wikipedia

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,570
always is exhausting

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:30,470
in terms of historical details but it

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:33,440
comes down to around the mid 1990s there

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,860
was a toolkit being built for x11 UNIX

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,920
remember that was proprietary unix's

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,260
basically sun OS hp-ux i was also being

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,910
built for Windows and then when Linux

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:49,640
showed up on the on the playing field

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,440
cute for x11 and Linux was first

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,060
released under the cute free edition

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,990
license and that kind of ran into two

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,200
issues because the cute Free Edition

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,560
license was not an open-source license

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,110
it wasn't free software it was intended

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,479
as such

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:15,460
but the letter of who law was different

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,099
so then cute was released two years

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,710
later in 1998 under the Q public license

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,500
the Q public license is an open-source

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,389
license it meets the definitions or

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,870
meets the requirements of the open

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,849
source definition but it's still yet

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,909
another free software and yet another

00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:37,569
open source license and since we don't

00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:41,229
like open source license proliferation

00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:43,180
it took another two years and then huge

00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:47,620
4 X 11 Linux was released some of the

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,379
GPL v2 so at that point it was

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,460
straightforward free software no

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,759
questions asked

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:57,639
five years later moved on to GPL v3 and

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,539
the windows code was released as well

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,599
four years later it was made some might

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:10,719
say freer by being released under the

00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:13,409
LGPL a lot of people still use cute

00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:15,729
under the LGPL because it's a nice

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:23,889
unrestrictive license unless you do a

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:26,650
lot of embedding and yeah let's just say

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,360
you can embed it in into stuff and not

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,310
need to worry about old provisions of

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:37,000
the GPL in 2011 the commercial licensing

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:40,389
r-remember cute is during all this time

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,460
being developed by a company and so it

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,409
also has a commercial licensing arm the

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,860
commercial licensing arm was sold to did

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:51,490
you so there's a lot of back and forth

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,110
on the licensing situation it's being

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,870
licensed under a number of different

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,300
free software licenses and it's also

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,180
been licensed all this time under

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,529
commercial terms and so all that time

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,180
the KDE community building kt software

00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,909
which has always been released under the

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:14,080
terms of the GPL version 2 some live

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:19,360
version 3 kt has been around all that

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,560
time so it's gone with the times so all

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,639
the time we've had this

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,560
free software based on cute and there's

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,550
this continual back and forth between

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,450
KDE and cute code moving one way or the

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,690
other

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,640
KDE writing fixes four things in cute

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,969
and cute producing new features that

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,029
then get used in KDE software so there's

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:47,140
this strong back and forth on the free

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:53,200
software front if we move into modern

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:56,380
times after the the sales Digia in 2012

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,529
we've got cute 5 which is now triple

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:03,760
licensed parts of it are gplv3 parts of

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:06,570
the LGPL v2 and there's also some bits

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,520
that are only commercially licensed

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:12,520
there was open governance created in

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,120
order to carry on the free software

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,520
development of cute and nowadays there's

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,000
a number of products coming out of the

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,220
cute company that are not exactly cute

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,190
some of them are labeled cute

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:32,279
for instance cute embedded I believe is

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:35,279
a product that looks like cute but isn't

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,240
so if we look at the current licensing

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:43,019
situation acute 514 is one of the most

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:47,730
recent releases I think 515 is scheduled

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:51,259
for May you can get that under the GPL

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,420
v3 the LGPL v2 and also commercial terms

00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:55,829
not all of the components of cute' are

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,720
available under all of these different

00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:03,870
licenses there's cute essentials sort of

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,620
the core and the widgets and things like

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:11,300
that those are available under specific

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:17,129
free software licenses and then there's

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:20,129
add-ons and interoperation bits some of

00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:22,470
which fall under commercial terms the

00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:26,029
KDE community of course cares most about

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:30,029
the free software parts so the free soft

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:33,120
the stuff the parts of cute that are

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:38,180
released as free software that get used

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,180
by KD e by kte software

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,560
that means that there's parts that we

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,870
don't particularly care about but

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,519
looking at the entirety of cutes

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,519
offerings all of it is important

00:10:51,560 --> 00:11:01,129
I should add somewhere during this talk

00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:03,860
if you use cute contribute to recurring

00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:06,680
theme in free software development is

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,879
how do we fund this stuff how do we make

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,149
sure that development continues and it's

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:17,060
really important to distinguish free

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:19,279
software users from free loaders free

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,350
software users can contribute by

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,600
contributing patches writing

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:29,449
documentation doing promotion and free

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,250
loaders don't do that and if you can't

00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:33,019
use it as free software and contribute

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,490
through free software you should

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:40,670
probably be paying for the software in

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:44,689
some way so if you use cute contributes

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:47,180
don't be a freeloader and carrying on

00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:49,339
with the current licensing situation

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,829
there's a really good talk by Burkhart

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:57,560
Stewart on making sure that your systems

00:11:53,829 --> 00:12:00,350
comply with the LGPL version 3 when

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,569
you're using cute it's not that hard

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,470
then you are a free software user of

00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:10,209
cute and if you do that he should

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:12,620
contribute through patches code etc

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,509
watch Burkhart stalk it's on YouTube

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,509
there's a link there will be a link in

00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:19,370
my slides eventually so returning to the

00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:21,230
history right we just talked a little

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,750
bit about the current situation

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,470
returning to history cute was originally

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,750
intended to be released as open source

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,880
he got screwed up then it was released

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,339
as free software it's still free

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,480
software it's important to note that

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:40,879
cute has been around for these 20 years

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,120
more than 20 years and it's still free

00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:48,910
software

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,269
but early on because of these these

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:55,449
issues with licensing and hate we got it

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:58,269
almost right there was an an early

00:12:55,449 --> 00:13:00,459
recognition that doing it as free

00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:04,720
software doing it in an open-source way

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:07,269
was the right thing to do with cute but

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,389
also that we needed some mechanism to

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:13,180
keep it free software remember if you're

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,040
free software is owned by a company then

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,459
that company can

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,589
well basically run off with it look at

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:25,769
what Oracle did with opensolaris for

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,769
instance you

00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:31,849
when you depend on free software from

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:36,859
some specific company you should keep in

00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:39,589
mind that it is the power of that open

00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:44,359
source of the open-source license that

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:46,939
keeps the company honest but you need

00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:50,049
more and that's where the KT freak huge

00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:54,139
foundation comes in because this is a

00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:56,629
foundation it holds a contract and the

00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:00,649
contract basically says that if cute

00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:02,779
stops being open source then the last

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,939
available version of cute' is

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:11,859
automatically released under the bsd to

00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:14,899
clause license there's details there

00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:20,449
that contract was originally signed with

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:22,849
trolltech trolltech was the company that

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:29,989
that was building cute back in the 90s

00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:32,539
and this underscores their belief in the

00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:35,509
power of free software the contract

00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:38,179
carries on to trolltech and all of its

00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:44,839
successors so when Nokia bought

00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:46,729
trolltech in 2009 I think that was the

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,669
the contract carried onto them and it

00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:52,189
continues to be handed on to each of the

00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:55,489
corporate holders of cute and their

00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:59,389
successors so this contract I'll go back

00:14:55,489 --> 00:15:02,299
one slide tells whoever is building

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,699
whoever owns cute right now and whoever

00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:07,129
is building cute that if cute stops

00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:11,229
being open source it is released under

00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,229
the bsd - clause license

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,950
that's an escape hatch it means that the

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,000
entire free software community that

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:30,620
depends on cute I remember that's more

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:34,640
than just KDE there's a lot of free as

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:37,430
in beer commercial software that uses

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,330
cute there's virtual dogs there's

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,070
musescore those aren't free software

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,410
musescore I think rose-garden does as

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,550
well plenty of free software out there

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:53,120
that uses cute and all of it has this

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:55,250
same escape hatch the same escape hatch

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,210
that that means that depending on cute

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:02,900
is not a risk because if something goes

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,860
wrong with the free with the free

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,710
software Ness

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,900
of cute that is if cute stops being

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,300
open-source it gets released under a

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,510
very liberal free software license and

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,330
we the free software community as a

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,320
whole can carry on with it so there's a

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:23,350
fork path if needed

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,490
but clearly this is a nuclear option

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,550
right

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:32,160
you don't want development to stop you

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:35,800
don't want the owners of cute to stop

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,730
cute being free software you want to

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,889
encourage the owners of cute to keep it

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,319
free software so that's why I said

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:48,339
earlier if you use cute contribute

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:52,600
because that's how you help cute remain

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:54,910
free software but if we need it we as in

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,079
the free software community we can be

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:01,779
weakened we can deal with it because

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,650
what is covered by this contract are the

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:10,209
core platforms x11 Android there's

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:12,900
additional platforms and this reflects

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,299
the well let's call it be traditional

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,120
interest of the community is our

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:25,020
interest is the free software operating

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:28,510
systems running x11 bolts cool stuff

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,250
there's an update clause in there the

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,440
KDE free cute foundation has the right

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,980
to update to a supported successor

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,040
platform basically this is saying when

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,429
x11 is no longer interesting but Weiland

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,970
is we can switch to Weiland no questions

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:49,210
asked and then the cute for Weiland part

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,230
becomes the covered part under the

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:56,799
contract that means that moving forward

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:59,980
when the whole desktop world the old

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,280
Linux world moves to Eiland eventually

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,440
you know they said this is like the year

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,860
of the Linux desktop there's the year of

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,790
the Weiland desktop is always sometime

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,730
in the future but when we get to Weiland

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,380
this contract can be updated to use

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,360
Weiland

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,500
and that means that if cute ever stops

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:30,130
being open source all the Weyland users

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:38,110
of cute are still covered the license

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:40,690
terms are so of the contract say that

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:47,410
all the parts of cute must be available

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:52,930
under specific licenses the core

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:55,690
libraries need to be LGPL LGPL alongside

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:58,390
their commercial licensing options and

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,120
this just means that the contract forces

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,030
the owner of cute to keep developing and

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,800
releasing it as LGPL software so that

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:12,640
depending on it is not a risk the other

00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,190
bits and pieces of cute can be LD gplv3

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:20,830
they can also be l gplv3

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:22,180
or sometimes gplv2 because the software

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,010
has been developed over a long time

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,530
there's there's plenty of variation in

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,680
the license again look at look at

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,810
burkhardt's to Burt's talk for help on

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,770
figuring out exactly what is needed

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:40,000
where and look at Gabriel's talk from

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:42,460
Faust north this morning on how to keep

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
track of all the metadata for your

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,000
licensing

00:19:50,550 --> 00:20:03,450
so to backtrack and summer is what we've

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:05,370
got is a 20 year old belief in cute

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,290
should be open source cute should

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,440
continue to be developed as open source

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,320
and we've got a hammer

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,970
well a nuclear option really that says

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,670
if it ever stops being open source then

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,040
there's an escape hatch and that means

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,940
that the entire free software community

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:31,620
can depend on using cute as free

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:34,770
software of course there's there's

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,200
issues there right there's there's

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,110
always some tension between freeloaders

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,760
and contributors between freeloaders and

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:47,250
free software users we in the KDE

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,690
community feel pretty strongly that you

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,950
should be writing free software anyway

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,590
and contributing through free software

00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:00,799
and if you want to write proprietary

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,799
software well go ahead but pay for it

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,840
yeah this basically wraps up my

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,960
description of the KDE free free cute

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,529
foundation it's out there it's still

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,679
running

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:21,210
it has websites and there's a specific

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:24,360
legal agreement I've summarized in my

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:29,460
talk about under what conditions the

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,919
whole thing triggers I said it a couple

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,730
of times if cute ever stops being open

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,169
source then it is released under the bsd

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,090
to clause

00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:46,169
there's the specific terms are rough

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:50,760
this is a confusing sentence the terms

00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:52,830
are approximately this if no new free

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,340
software release of cute shows up in

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:59,809
twelve months then three months after

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:03,140
that the nuclear option gets triggered

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:05,520
but it doesn't have to be triggered

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,020
there's a great deal of talking back and

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,520
forth between the KDE free cute

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,669
foundation and the cute company to make

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,370
sure that we're we keep each other

00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:17,690
honest we keep each other on track to

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,970
develop things as best we can

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,950
when my slides go online you will be

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,740
able to click on website and the

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,330
agreements bits there to get to the

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,580
specific text if that's what you're

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,799
interested in now I'm going to move on

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,990
to questions and I see that I finished

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:39,210
quite on time

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:43,620
questions okay come here can you hear me

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:46,980
lovely lovely hi so it's the first one

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,350
what is sorry I need to move a window

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,190
here well what is your view on the

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,679
latest developments for example that the

00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:00,899
cute company won't back port fixed to

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,110
older open source versions of course I'm

00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:05,850
gonna get this question so I'm gonna

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,190
stress that I am NOT a member of the KTV

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:13,789
free cute foundation and I'm going to

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,789
answer this question with my own hat on

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:24,779
last I heard is that security fixes

00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:28,049
would be going into the LTS branches but

00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:38,179
it continues to be an item for

00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:43,110
discussion I think that people using LTS

00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:47,279
versions under the free software license

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:50,909
should should write in here here's

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:56,690
mostly a moral obligation should also be

00:23:50,909 --> 00:24:02,039
contributing to maintenance thereof so I

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:05,429
can find it in my heart to forgive the

00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:09,480
cutes company if they decide not to back

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:13,919
port fixes - LTS themselves

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:18,510
I can also totally imagine a foundation

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,850
being called into existence under the

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:25,830
Commons Conservancy or under I don't

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:28,380
know some consortium that does that LTS

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:31,260
maintenance itself it would be weird I'm

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:36,809
not sure whether there's any software

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:39,330
products where LTS support is done by an

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:43,100
association outside of the original

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,100
pretty producer

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:51,100
that would make that would sort of make

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:53,260
sense for me okay Katie and norm has a

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,970
lot of contributors what are the most

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,690
important things to think about when

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:06,370
starting a project well that's a that's

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:09,310
an amazingly broad question the most

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:12,940
important thing when starting a project

00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:15,820
is to know in your own mind what is the

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:20,650
problem you want to solve and then just

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:24,820
pick the best tools and pick a good

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:27,000
license as well this is this is me

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:35,830
stepping sort of onto onto Gabriel's

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:39,880
turf I guess make a good license either

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:45,340
go for choose a license suitable for

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:49,120
broad adoption for broad contribution or

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:54,420
for revenue maximization I won't say

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:57,580
those are mutually exclusive but if you

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,940
pick BSD to clause for your license then

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,410
you're going to have a different time

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,940
getting contributions than if you do

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,940
pick the gplv3

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,570
short answer no okay problem is do you

00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,820
think the cute license and your

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,030
relationship with the company is having

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,900
an effect negative or positive on your

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:34,490
community

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:38,130
I think it has effect in that it's it's

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:43,920
it's bit of an ADD first adversity

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:46,679
breeds unity right as as we sort of

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,940
wrestle with the current changes in the

00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:55,559
cute licensing landscape the KDE

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:59,760
community comes together with okay we

00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:03,630
need this stuff doing and as the largest

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:11,059
free software consumer of cute

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:15,030
we feel that we represent the larger

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:17,750
sufficiently large population to get

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:22,800
stuff done so I'm going to call it

00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:25,470
positive even though it feels feels like

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,690
we're wrestling with negative with a

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:33,570
negative situation right now the

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,150
contract mentioned in the talk is

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:41,730
currently between the cute company and

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:43,830
Katy Evie question mark no the contract

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,610
is between

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,830
the cute company and the KDE free cute

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:54,480
foundation like I said at the beginning

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:59,910
this is an independent organization it

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:03,030
has board members who are who come from

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:06,290
Katy ee-vie it has board members who

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:11,250
come from the cute company but it is

00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:14,760
independent of KDE AV and if the

00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:18,080
contract triggers then it is the

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:23,070
foundation that receives the right to

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:26,400
release cute under the the BSD - clause

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:30,260
and it is not KDE evie that release

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:34,320
perceives that right so it's independent

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:39,350
and the final question that how much is

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,350
Katy contributing to the QT source code

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:52,260
that that's a that's an excellent

00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:56,270
metrics question one that I don't have

00:28:52,260 --> 00:29:01,260
concrete numbers for but just watching

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:04,320
IRC like KDE plasma IRC and the number

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:12,360
of upstream bug reports and upstream bug

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:15,450
fixes that come from that I would guess

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,490
and in this case guess basically means

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:23,010
I'm gonna make up a number and say oh

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,560
but a quarter of a huge contribution

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,800
comes directly or indirectly through

00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,800
Katy

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:36,539
but like I said that's yes okay with

00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,450
that last question I think I'll leave

00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:41,879
over to you one yeah and I would like to

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,919
extend a really big thanks to to agent

00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:45,929

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,989
viewers to to attending and asking good

00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,989
questions

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,710
and with that I would like to thank our

00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,160
