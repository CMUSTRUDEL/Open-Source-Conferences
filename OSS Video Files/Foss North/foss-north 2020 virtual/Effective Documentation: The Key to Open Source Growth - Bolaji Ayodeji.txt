welcome to force north the virtual

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,250
edition we would like to thank all our

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,300
sponsors and partners in this difficult

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,809
situation our gold sponsors look soft

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,950
and ansible by Red Hat

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,210
our silver sponsors ITRs group and make

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,870
it right

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:28,930
our base sponsors

00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,119
our partner projects the open source

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,210
community and the region of Gothenburg

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,190
and a huge thanks to our awesome

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,580
community this would not have been

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,150
possible without you welcome back

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,760
everyone

00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,890
so next up is Balaji who will talk about

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,830
effective documentation and why that is

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,610
important in open source project so the

00:00:47,830 --> 00:01:37,110
stage is yours

00:00:48,610 --> 00:01:40,679
welcome hello everyone so yeah so yeah

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,080
the photo developer and getting to like

00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:45,610
yeah I'm also community manager as a

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,220
research community after that it's

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,369
expanding sauce and success in Algeria

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,860
and also instability in jump start with

00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:56,259
in Enochs and free and open source

00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:04,590
aperture advocates so that's pretty much

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:04,590
my god that's pretty much it about me

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,800
okay so just a quick introduction to

00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,360
what will be rolling through today so

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,930
I'm first of all we'll run along to

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,630
introduction to open such documentation

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,819
the leads of open source understanding

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,880
user personas the effective

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,830
documentation strategies bad

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,500
documentation checklist good

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,330
accommodation checklist and some

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,030
documentation tools are the community

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:36,040
child's and that what next so arm so

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,629
basically local source documentation is

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,580
an information that describes the

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,590
project to its users

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,830
contributors so I'm there's an emphasis

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,840
here on users and contributors

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,820
redefinition first to oppose there is

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,220
the competition for your users and there

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,690
is a one contributors so we're talking

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,250
about open source en I'm sure you're

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,110
familiar with what contributors would

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,730
mean and what users would mean this is

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,810
basically a quick introduction to what a

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,910
permutation is in general um so before

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,340
Percy there's no meats in open source

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,640
out ones outline now and I'm sure might

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,370
be familiar with that and one of these

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,700
needs is open source is responsibility

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,350
of the Queensway alone so like this but

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,000
this is this is everywhere where people

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,130
feel open source is just about the

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,910
Creator arm and there's a streets from

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,500
Angie Jones like a couple weeks ago and

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,050
she said someone asked me if it's true

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,850
was open source and I excitedly said yes

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,510
and we got to tell them how they could

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,580
contribute

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,340
they looked puzzled and they didn't

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,500
actually care if it was open source what

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,000
it means was it is free and funny how

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,580
everyone wants free but didn't wanna

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,870
help you it's selected several engineers

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,340
and developers using open source

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,110
projects they just believe it's free a

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,489
free open source project or they don't

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,560
really want to contribute to it and

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,290
that's an it open source is just not

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,860
about to create alone it's open source

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,170
so forget that and secondly does it meet

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,120
that open source is just about code and

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,980
this is really really forced because

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,440
open source is not about quote there

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,540
Compass's all the planning that goes

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,060
before writing the code you don't just

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,739
sit under CRI want to be an open source

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,900
projects from nothing you have to do

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,580
some final or I have this idea and then

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,019
I want to put it down to something so if

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,090
the process that goes even before

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,650
writing they put itself and there's a

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,180
process that grow while rightly put on

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,640
the process after right in the groups

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,560
the pencil is about school we have

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,510
design there is documentation there is

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,790
so much more that moves into open source

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,010
even market scene unfolding so much more

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:37,570
so you open source is not just about

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:41,110
code and so yeah so today we are talking

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,640
about the facts in documentation and how

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,400
it is a key to the growth of the open

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,870
source project so we'll be doing

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,330
something like the first one is

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,860
understanding user personas like one key

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,279
to building great open source

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,229
implementations understand

00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,969
you're right Elizabeth intuition pork

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,979
because this varies across different

00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:59,719
budgets I might have an open-source

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:02,389
project like very small projects will be

00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:03,109
alive Lee or just a package something

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,359
small

00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:07,489
I understand that my persona is just

00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:10,819
maybe a developers just wanted to try

00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:12,409
something out or something my audience

00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,989
is just very little and you might have

00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:16,909
very complex food that's like let's say

00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:20,179
a book and then the audience is very

00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:21,679
much larger than just developers so the

00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:23,599
first thing to do the effective

00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:26,539
documentation is understanding your user

00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,309
persona and I outlined a couple of

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,459
possible ever going to look around today

00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:33,709
and the first one is end users so or end

00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:36,139
users and the final consumers people

00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,729
usually a project and once you should

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,159
know that an end user doesn't have to be

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,289
a developer you might subscribe the X

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:44,809
that is eventually going to be used by

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:47,029
just random humans one action you know

00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:49,399
developers perplexity I don't know if

00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,739
you're familiar with sugar or using

00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,509
blocks from sugar labs so it's an open

00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:55,189
source project that's being used by kids

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,049
so those kids under development like

00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,299
data end users so if you write any

00:05:57,049 --> 00:06:01,009
documentation users understand are over

00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:02,779
and we have an end user at the end of

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,869
our project so you should consider them

00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,699
also write it in a documentation and the

00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:09,679
next one we have is developers like I'm

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,449
sure this is the one we eventually am

00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:13,429
saying we imagine our documentation for

00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,439
we focus a lot on rights and Campello

00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:16,939
passed on this calm when you get

00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,069
thinking about having contributors so

00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,869
then a becomes a student you have data

00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:23,360
to us and then we're writing the

00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:24,949
documentation for developers and this

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,629
can cut across different range of

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:30,349
developers beginners in the media and

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,699
all that houston more on that v-neck

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:35,329
slides

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,099
designers this defiles around several

00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,919
projects or your project will determine

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:42,259
if your user persona we include design

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,909
as like I said earlier and this parcel

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,009
as I'm listening before projects I'm

00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,389
giving you a general list you can look

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,299
at it and say ok which is customer

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:52,069
supplies my project for small projects

00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:54,409
you may need to write any documentation

00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:57,019
designers will complete your project

00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,429
have some sort of design contribution

00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:00,139
and then we should also write some

00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:04,429
documentation for designers how did they

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:06,510
set up how do they contribute the Lodox

00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:10,260
so you need to consider them

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,240
so next we have technical writers people

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,890
Muslim Wanda and see how can technical

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,970
writers and contributes to open source

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:20,700
and a backwards the communication itself

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,260
is open sourced and then it's been

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,580
managed by some people and dispute by

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,020
going to the rights in and obviously

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,180
will be a technical right that's what

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,500
also contributes to a project so we also

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,990
need to understand that you would have

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,910
to provide us how do you create your

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,220
projects that which is welcoming to them

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,100
ok let's imagine your documentation is

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,080
written in markdown so what guy do you

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,840
have for the providers to understand how

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,890
to introduce to your conscious mind if I

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,350
maybe I would love to be markdown

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,550
possibly I just mean I would fighting

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,500
them all text and I didn't know about

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,360
markdown documentation has to be

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,790
welcoming for me to understand oh it's

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,620
not down this is how Magnum works and it

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,330
should be so much beginner friendly we

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,410
will approach that into ampere for next

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,190
item so arm Google manages so we had a

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,390
program managers fit in your project

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,100
developer program manager is obviously

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,690
just managing a project and they can

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,580
share everything runs from start to

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,590
finish so as the program manager I am

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,300
looking for tools that would make my

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,640
engineering team skill I'm looking for

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,400
tools and products that would increase

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,990
like our workflow right so when I'm

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,760
scanning sugars and projects I'm like oh

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,040
how can we simplify these how can we

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,370
automate this stuff and then I just let

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,900
me just make a search for an opportunity

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,410
one or two things and then I find the

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,740
projects and the product manager I am a

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:39,870
user and then I have my own I would

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,990
explain my around these users and what

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,540
he wants understand the program and also

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,850
common projects and next we have

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,070
financial contributors we have like an

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,140
awesome and amazing community in the new

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,060
system right now whereby we are also

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,070
possibly Tschida in terms of learning in

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,930
terms of open source so much more we

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,030
have so many companies so many

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,550
individuals or supports in open source

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,580
projects financially and so we have some

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,040
financial contributors to 6 1 trying

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,570
products to sponsor and so how do you

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,340
create your product in a sense that is

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,630
work woman for financial engineer just

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,370
this once it would also look around

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,950
because they are also one persona and

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,020
yeah that's pretty much it so and this

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,820
is interesting part now so what it is is

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,800
a personas

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,640
what did we actually want work on with

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,380
your project you need to understand

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,980
first of all what do they want to get

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:35,120
out of a project what solutions does a

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:38,560
project offer to them what could be

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,560
initiation mindsets and

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,029
okay so let's move to the street

00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,230
buoyancy the question is what do they

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,570
want to get out of the project I

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,310
mentioned for an end user name user just

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,920
wants to use the project ID really care

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,100
about what technologies you used to

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,660
really care about installing your base I

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,430
just want to see the finished work so

00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,589
the documentation I deploy into that

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,570
student how to use a project how do I

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,820
use how do I use that and that's all

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,410
that matters to an end user so develop

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,850
are you explaining how to set up it

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,740
could be a Zhou to install there is how

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,570
to run these alpha set of these and all

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,029
that so you know competition to develop

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,640
is fight depend on an end user and then

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,170
I'm just about to use SMS and for

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,700
designers it's quite different I mean a

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,100
designer doesn't really care about the

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,750
hood beast listens to understand the

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,680
design accessories put it there needs

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,240
contribution how do I set of Sigma or

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,890
what so you're using how do I can she

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,260
reach to your designs how do you use

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,510
github and all that stuff or what you're

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,959
writing designer protecting plight or

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,339
you're excluding the extreme in what

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,230
pertains to them technical and in this

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,149
case about whether or not Co protect

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,620
this man down and all that how did it

00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,079
mean she needs to the technical parts of

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,520
the project and program managers just

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:53,020
want to see how tribally put it is so as

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,010
I put the manager I'm looking for it to

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:59,170
live without or for my company and and I

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,690
just I just searching week on some fun

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,390
improv its massage for this slightly and

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:07,000
then I find yours so I'm scrolling shape

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,370
who they try to see if it's worth trying

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,020
out to my continent so my go at appoints

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,430
needs to really try your particular you

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,440
pull it out so I don't want to try out

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,360
several if I want to understand all the

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,860
affiliates is what it's for me to try so

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,089
you need enough information to tell me

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,130
I'm on this you know all of these

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,959
projects is this this is what it was so

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm in the next cup of slider with

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,500
spillways and do around that and then

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,230
for financial contributors we all know I

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,730
didn't really want to know how you peel

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,370
it is dude wants understand the history

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,829
behind that projects and what exactly

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,890
you are doing it and how tribunal simply

00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:41,620
come back now but statistics do you have

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,149
what I get sheets and I need to

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,709
understand the wow this place is doing

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,420
well enough like we need a sponsor then

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,250
because the creators are spending their

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,380
time their money get energy no this less

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,060
for them and then just wanna see all

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,570
that information so when you put out

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,190
some

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,960
use ice removal operation on show

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,850
contributor we all want to see records

00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,610
and statistics around a project and all

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,040
that and so you need to put in mind that

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,390
they want to see you need to understand

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,100
what you want to get how did you put it

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,960
a success mindset economies and then

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,520
what solution does your product offer I

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,680
means you predict a light wave doesn't

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,270
help people to automate something then

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,270
how they do this and all that you need

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,930
to understand that first of all and then

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,730
misunderstand what will be the initial

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,350
mind so like I mentioned each is a

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,810
person atones the different mindsets to

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,010
your projects

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,050
the next thing is understand is where

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,960
and this user personas coming from like

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,910
how did you find your projects like I

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,560
mentioned earlier all these plans you

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,120
make before back to you that maybe to

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,380
understand a ship and make sure you have

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,940
enough flexibility nutrition so

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,890
understand where your users are coming

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,920
from so first of all I recommend on

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,630
search engines so politican CEO open

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,700
source player from search engine for me

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,160
such engine because the main I have a

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:52,660
mind sets so I did not just go to Google

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,730
and just scratch let's say story book

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,560
and open source Marmara and I didn't

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,240
just randomly just five random words and

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,100
this combo only put that little B that

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,630
can happen so I obviously winds to be

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,690
able to search for there could be x-ray

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,090
vision it's possible I'm looking for

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,920
what so when I used to do some UI

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,430
components in isolation and then I just

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,710
found like so I I was a query that

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,390
brought me to your projects so

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,310
understanding where the users are coming

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,410
from the first one is from search engine

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,240
and second it can be from solution this

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,610
is very very common so when you create

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,710
open source products they usually will

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,800
be Tweety's and say oh I get to store

00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,900
for the post on Wendy's or other social

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,460
media platforms or they posted on hash

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,100
Lord and say alright in the school store

00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,380
and in a distributor oh nice so I can

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,940
just go move on they put it for my

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,010
timeline and just click on it and then

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,560
are not proteins I don't have any

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,570
mindset so I'm just clicking to try and

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,150
figure out what's up with the project so

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,250
what is different is in such-and-such

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,480
engine there was a query I was trying to

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,490
find something I've been a nice normal

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
day and put it some special media I was

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,330
just pulling to my timeline and let's

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,770
say so on I am someone I know which eats

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,900
them retreats that's rich and I'm like

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,450
let me check it out I just click on it

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,890
on others but these and what's all that

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,540
I just

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,310
so at that point I will do have it in

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,560
mind sir but funny enough the project

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,570
might be interesting I would want to try

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,280
out and then my schooling I might listen

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,500
to my god we has a spoiler grid all

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,630
alone I been looking for this and then I

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,750
just try it out understand

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,670
next we have social media and then next

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,440
we have backlinks from other sides so

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,470
this is very common and basically a

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,010
matter is just a link that's a link on

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,990
one side to another side so let's assume

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,020
ideal open-source projects called X

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,150
rights and then in another website with

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,730
Jim on article or something

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,010
I can reference that attitude in the

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,990
sense of saying oh I wish same disc open

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,420
source which can help you do this and

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,130
that and that and then it's listed in

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,570
your attitude let us zoom on written a

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,640
positive and then I get to the points

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,950
where that link is exactly I just click

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,540
on it my mindset is quite similar to the

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,700
person coming from social media I just

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,080
stumbled on this and what is the

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,690
difference in social media and

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,490
Backlund's because for you to click on

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,860
that link it means you've read out chili

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,900
article and that link it's sort of

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,750
related to what's your reading about so

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,250
when I checked you and I see ok this is

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,920
quite some you know and I just click on

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,960
it and then I just put it I have like

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,490
half my instead on what I am looking for

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,110
I'm looking for something if you late

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,810
and something related to the article

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,310
Avedon and then I just put it so that's

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:32,770
the told your next is we have package

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,830
managers so we have tons of open source

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,950
to determine back in packages JavaScript

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,260
or Python and other languages so with us

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,660
we have NPM select engines in package

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,060
manager that pulls all JavaScript

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,860
packages so I'm very calm only for me to

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,050
stomp you on your productivity packages

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,660
by stratagem package manager Sam let's

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,970
say I just wanna find you can help me

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,560
automate something I just go to end game

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,780
and just search mouth starts and then I

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,760
find it so this is quite similar to

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,230
search engine but spy detailed I

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,940
understand that I am looking for a

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,460
package and they're just looking for any

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,260
random open source product I go to a

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,000
particular to find a package so my

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,980
mindset there is to stretch with the

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,970
particular play just like search engines

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:18,340
both for packages so these are for ideas

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,270
run be a Regis might become uniform so

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,680
nationals understand

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,350
how much time we really did it is

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,090
documentation and this is very crucial

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,560
in helping you prepare for an effective

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,780
documentation because when you look at

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,410
it and any user doesn't really have so

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:34,750
much time like it's possible so under

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,870
comments that personal essay music blogs

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,160
for example which is amputee or kids I'm

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,320
a kid I really don't know anything about

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,810
your project so I just seen this product

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,630
out like and my develop ideas taken out

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,810
in the pool awesome but like here that

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,190
point is just using your projects so any

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,320
become additional sheet to pay for me at

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,870
that point should be as neat soon as

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,340
possible because I really don't have so

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,750
much time to read so much the

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,690
communication I just care about the

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,610
product so you should prepare

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,050
documentation may be any notifications

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,970
you see and all that kind of stuff it

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,990
should be very brief to show you a let

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,580
me join and very common facts I'm

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,640
shocked oh I'm all this kind of put it

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,860
is products that have end results like

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,540
an open source like a music blog like

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,040
it's an open source project but like

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,200
there's an end result that people use

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,670
but and the process really likes to

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,560
ebook it's more like so developer

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,330
soliloquy from our own personal products

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,210
rights its no really consume my end

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,680
Jesus Christ so while I'm coming to your

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,150
projects I really don't care about how

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,040
you beauty products I just want to use

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,300
the projects so whatever documentation

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,100
you prepare for me an apple and should

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,040
either be inside the application itself

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,590
or like before I fancy your application

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,270
didn't have to redirect me to it page TV

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,910
documentation if I come and download

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,310
your application or and all backs so

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,740
next is how fast they want it and any

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,870
other ones you can as fast as possible

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,520
for development they won't eat as fast

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,380
as possible all simple like it doesn't

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,320
mean you should increase the speed of

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,790
how does it read it like a developer

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,980
wants enough information about how to

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,570
sell their product right so while

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,070
considering the speed at which you want

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,050
them to read here the Commission will

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,650
also need to provide enough information

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,120
so this speed varies across the length

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,440
of the information are provided so if

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,810
you're the communication is an issue

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,880
project set up you really should

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,410
calculate some how long does it take

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,320
from the syllabus product and how long

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,570
how can i optimize that so it would

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,580
differ by project so you will see

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,669
because this product and suit me three

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,799
minutes understand how to setup and then

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,019
yes three minutes also here's my happy

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,820
longer setup and then I think you like

00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,769
let's say five minutes that's fine so

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,359
understanding it put it is one first

00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:44,159
keys and a standard width and height

00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,470
works and then you can now determine how

00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,909
fast we wants it and flexion I should

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,499
contribute to how fast they want to read

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:52,879
the books you should national container

00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:55,559
doesn't really care about how to set

00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:57,539
context using the billeting here they

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:01,289
only care about okay and what is useful

00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,659
and do what made it lead but I didn't

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:05,309
super and how try again is a community

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,869
and all that and then we just wanna see

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,519
the statistics and then that's all I

00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:10,289
just decide oh I click on your patiently

00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,090
all Europe and collectively and I

00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,919
suppose you see on the foundation I

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,509
should continually have enough times

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,779
with so much amounts all your

00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:22,049
documentation and then next is how fast

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,669
time and then so nestin is like it's

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,809
more like a personal analysis you do be

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,590
providing documentation now you

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,779
understand that your users once you

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,489
documentation in like three minutes now

00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,109
you understand that so how fast can a

00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:36,210
recommendation from then it's nineteen

00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:38,340
to up to my zit admonition three users

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,200
and that seemed to ensure that she

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,379
documentation something because for

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,179
let's say we developer writes what I

00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:46,499
want to get an enemy put dates to team

00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,090
with either I'm trying to contribute

00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:50,039
steer predator I'm trying to use your

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,840
prudence for my own personal project so

00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,970
we are trying to install your projects

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,279
to mine or trying to set up your could

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,559
be so I can to the right so I have two

00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,210
mindsets there and Molly attorney stab

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,119
me now is providing solution and how I

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,919
can install your cookies or install the

00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,960
finished product that's continue to

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,029
understand me so now you understand how

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,649
fast I wants to get us really Percy you

00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,539
understand I just wanna set up right and

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:14,489
then you now understand how fast can my

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,019
documentation fair intention this can

00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:18,210
also work if you already have some sort

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,919
of documentation sets so you need to

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,960
like three I to it and understand how

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,899
fast is my documentation serving my

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,249
users or my developers and the great one

00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,080
for you to understand this is by running

00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:29,639
some sort of survey they can do some

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,259
documentation so they understand okay

00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:33,539
get some developers well

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,690
axial won't be using it projects like a

00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,409
or few months ask them how fast the this

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,809
documentation

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:41,519
help you you can even gets people who

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:44,220
are Norfolk you can you can get these

00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,110
user personas each of them and ask them

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,670
so like one test my recommendation

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,830
you can get an end user you can get a

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,570
developer you can get a program manager

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,280
if I know I want you to try out to

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,950
documentation and give you feedback on

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,570
what you should improve so like you

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,000
don't know how you don't know them oh I

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,679
wants to check it X or Y you just go

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,630
then go to use documentation tell me

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,250
what you think how do you decide you

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,230
have the questions ready how fast our

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,880
first wasn't able to answer your

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,210
question stuff like that you need to be

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
able to run some analysis on so V before

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,780
statistician and this is one minute

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,790
we'll fill to put those open solidify

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,230
this 5,000 store blah blah blah we're

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,669
done and then we just ship it out and

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,290
then you never can tell you if it is

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,669
actually strapped in your users or not

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,440
you just believe it have some sort of

00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,419
documentation and Maxine is the defense

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,140
between routine intuition and

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,910
documentation and that's why I think in

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,950
addition they might have a documentation

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,299
but it's not effective enough so how do

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,020
you name it respectively love is what

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,669
we're discussing right now so a fact

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,559
they need to consider also is how fast

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,390
can you get documentation respond to

00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,900
your user issues so one thing you should

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,400
understand in in this sense now is when

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,290
it comes to contribute to the project or

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,490
you use in projects there are times

00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,590
where your projects will have issues

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,690
people have seen max in up to you how

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,270
fast can we adopt respond to the issues

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,400
ok please give up there is an issue

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,799
system that people use to report issues

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,179
balls and all that right our first any

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,100
response to them is also um in the fly

00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,650
box your documentation so when I kind of

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,140
your dogs are saying put that same is

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,490
one with an issue or a block and there's

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,770
no feedback for like three months six

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,540
more like that's really cool and I

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,240
should get enough information in the

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,090
house even respond to me I've seen box

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,370
that you tell zero if you have any issue

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,380
you either open an issue you get back to

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,270
you like in in some days and on that

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,710
back the user should understand how so

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,990
you can respond to the issues because

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,760
this is a part of one reason why deny

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,620
the community documentation because for

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,960
example let's assume I found their

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,600
projects from a package manager like NPM

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,520
I might have stumbled on the exact could

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,440
be is right so I just restored from day

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,520
and at some points I have some issues

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,809
which I put it I want to get help and I

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,490
point my mindset for community

00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:59,840
open-source product is just to get out

00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,840
not really I

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,990
just comes and in hope so your

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,940
documentation should also explain how

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,620
angry I can get hope you want to reach

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,360
out to you via email or just read an

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,890
issue or how long will it take you to

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,800
respond to me even if it's just nice to

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,180
meet the time of response or if I have

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,830
more question do you have some sort of

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,530
community if you have some sort of

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:22,350
discord channel or destroyed our slack

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,820
whatever all the Sumida species I can

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,250
reach out to you for more help like it

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,920
should be communication because that is

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,440
one mindset people can come with and

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,720
then lastly you need to consider how

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,460
satisfied we may be a like I mentioned

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,230
earlier you have to find these Chiefs of

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,740
the littleness and how satisfied your

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,840
users have been so far you analyze for

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,050
boots on end users developers program

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,240
managers all the user personas you can

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,400
can come across we put it understand how

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,940
satisfied you have been over time and

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,410
then one other thing is understand why

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,040
potential documentation is out

00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,840
technically see we the users now in

00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,670
terms of users and contributors units

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,890
under standards festival there is a

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,840
particularly called new and then is a

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,360
category called the beginners it's quite

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,320
stupid to the difference so a newbie I

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,600
have no idea about the project doors so

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,430
let's see any open source product we

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,230
listen to Android I really don't know

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,180
much about Android right so if I stole

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,620
all your projects I am a newbie I

00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,260
believe in your engine about that

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:28,680
product and then you have to explain the

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,660
bits and pieces of which

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,820
from the stats you can't explain how on

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,500
how to disclose what does it do and all

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,110
that tax free media now

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,820
Howie begin I slightly depending maybe

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,590
in the sense that I am Lori did a

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,450
beginner to take well I can be beginner

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,850
to your projects in the sense like let's

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:48,210
say I'm spending domestic flights and

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,730
then I have no idea about what Ruby does

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,530
right or would be on waves any comments

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,120
just pull it I am no longer a new people

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,900
at any beginners or put it because I

00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:00,360
have and I want to use add up for in the

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:09,120
first Lexi I'm sitting out in April that

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:10,470
you will be a but why do so at a point I

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
am no longer a newbie but I can be

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,590
beginner to approach its addition the

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,510
slight difference between the newbie and

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,670
the beginner an accessible musician

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,530
because a newbie has totally no idea

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,180
about logic to the worst and most times

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,790
end users fall into the category of

00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,280
music's the religion understand and it's

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,020
noble projects and develop has most time

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,620
I fall into consideration beginners

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,700
understand that this is a second and

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,620
technical strange in my kids and then

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,180
the third one is intermediate store in

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,070
the media's already have an idea of your

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,720
project rights it's possibly money to me

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,580
it's really linen one day or the other

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,820
and and I'm trying out let's say English

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,190
keyboard so I already know we react when

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,990
I'm trying to learn you guys oh I

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,360
already have an idea of how that works

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,830
and then I'm sure it's about you so I'm

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,870
a little mini bright because I have an

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,750
idea of how the alternative system work

00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,940
wise and then next we have expert so

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,770
it's very easy to why you misunderstand

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,050
how technically say with your eyes that

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,910
will help you in deciding how blends you

00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,010
are we succeeded up usually be a because

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,660
fun extracts you justly provide them

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,550
with misinformation like they've been

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,950
working for like yes and you understand

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,260
how to set up on roller coaster then

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,180
this is it's usually give me to throw my

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,590
next file and say oh you a chill entry

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,080
game like an extra don't really need to

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,960
see you right in games awesome I just be

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,760
packaged in - install for a beginner and

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,570
I need you to write NPM for me because

00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:32,280
my given its reference documentation oil

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,810
linking battling someone explain what

00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,880
NPN means for me because I really have

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,590
no idea like I mentioned this there is a

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,820
course or a project for understanding

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,910
all this would help you in determining

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,760
what strategies work best for projects

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,260
cause you would then determine okay is

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,980
my putting being used by the genus

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:52,200
Anubis I predict like let's see let's

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,700
see a JavaScript stream of lights

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,170
it's a zoom before you use that

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,300
framework you really have an idea of

00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,580
jealousy right so you'll assume that you

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,680
have newbies left at zero because it's

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,390
like the project is based on something

00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,180
else so this assume that before you

00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,580
can't even lend a samosa fastbacks by so

00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,260
you end up points and the standards

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,510
you'd open officially propose no on 8

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,190
minutes and expand all these user

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,990
personas and all these strategies will

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,690
help you understand which works best for

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,760
your projects very small and very little

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,920
that's in mind these are possible

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,210
newbies and beginners of like a very

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,220
complex for you like something really

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,870
complex to my discontent is or just

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,760
extracts never can tell

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,250
so on the spinning wheel work based or

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,350
legally rebuilt and the last one is just

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,820
a music-hall to see my code which the

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,950
code was like really we're super

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,200
professional moving unit for years 20

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,270
years three years like you can imagine

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,080
as a slight difference between expands

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,800
on this category so you can yeah so now

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,210
I'm applying you pipeline some of this

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,590
these are consumers and way she's gonna

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,040
see the last election we should apply oh

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,050
nice

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,450
but if taxi booking officials population

00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,790
pollution surely location is actually

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,470
actually because all of this possible

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,300
you can understand I it's possibly a

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,160
limitation is not effective at all it's

00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,920
just standing there just a we defy you

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,800
never can tell if it's up in the users

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,270
or your computers you can tell so first

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,490
image understand all you need to do

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,650
whenever you have an effective strategy

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,560
is first of all define the vision of

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,450
their projects so now these vary across

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,950
your projects so what are the core

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,140
reasons be playing videa Mitchell

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,610
projects what's what was she behind this

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,900
that's when you pull that what what are

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,620
you looking at they put it in the next

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,550
couple yes so it looked like a fish

00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,170
story bro fights

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,780
I'm using some will fire I use them a

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,240
lot okay so let's see the idea behind

00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,920
that is to help people build UI

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,670
components and I solution lights and

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,170
then coefficient can you look around

00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,120
that okay in the next three years I want

00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,920
all front-end developers to be able to

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,890
utilize my product I wanted to be able

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,110
to use so able to go they want to go to

00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,420
yield all kind of y-component

00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,220
want to live in isolation it's so many

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,540
features and so many features and all

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,370
that because at the point of realism

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,290
open-source projects you really don't

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,120
have a finished product right and we can

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,429
click here from bullets like Uncle Sam

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,799
books like if you I'm already history or

00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:13,049
any story from Ivan and ice you would

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,150
see that the point of digital sandbox it

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,890
was just smoke bullet crisis was just

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,960
you'll just randomly make on here school

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,720
and being it away that's something

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,179
around that's right so at that point of

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,400
study projects it just had like few

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,169
ideas and key features but like he

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,360
already had some political citizens

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:32,850
Kalyan movie already was thinking around

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,040
okay the next couple months I want

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,960
people to be able to roll an entire

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,010
project on put sign books without having

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,350
to do anything else

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,910
maybe at the early stage this idea was

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,919
just to create an editor that works on

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,169
the web and then we already I mean I do

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,580
here in couple months I can now addition

00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,110
allows them to run it put that in the

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,240
works understand what dish are you happy

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,850
I put it and keep that in mind as a

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,880
first thing you need to do and then next

00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:59,760
one to define your target states so I'm

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,230
wanting to understand is the clear and

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,169
we are listed impossible communication

00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,510
boos don't try to do so much even into

00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,040
because we've talked about effectiveness

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,070
and there you just want to have like a

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,240
documentation of like 5,000 words or

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,460
something around that's like low

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,500
understand your target state and betray

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,419
the realistic you should do what you

00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,700
know you can achieve for a small package

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,650
like let's say a JavaScript package

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,240
isn't just so little you don't have to

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,160
worry about its length documentation we

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,559
just type something small and it shuts

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,090
it on its own so being effective doesn't

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,520
mean it should be bulky doesn't mean it

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,750
should contain so many information we

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,280
just managed to contain enough

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,929
information that is related at that

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,450
point based on the user Asuna

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,940
so the clone realistic don't try to go

00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,919
about here understand what works best

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,570
for your project and then declare what

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,580
do you think you can achieve so in the

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,230
first amounts let's say you plan on just

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,270
having the documentation on the radio

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,799
file that's fine and then you've already

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,049
planned that in the next couple of weeks

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,480
you would have like a box page like

00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,830
something complex right and the point of

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,809
starting their product was meeting but

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,190
like you really agenda and so in let's

00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:04,290
say six month my project should have

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,820
grown so much and we now have certainly

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,190
be easily I need to provide enough

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,830
information that's a goal the clear we

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,240
are listed

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,799
would not try to lock away the

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,929
documentation three inch at the early

00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,370
stage when so really we did for it's a

00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,380
goal you understand that you need is in

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,059
the next six month the clearly are

00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,299
listed in tried to go overboard here and

00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:23,830
then next thing is doing gap analysis

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,809
between your current states and your

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,190
packet states that commission alia is

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,470
possible we already have in the

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,360
permutation amount so understand what is

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,799
my packet states in the next six months

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,440
I want my documentation should be able

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,899
to start like 1000 users create on these

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,669
enough information about my project and

00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:41,950
how to set up an out usually and all

00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:44,380
that's that's if I get it right so you

00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,669
click run analysis between where you are

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,110
now and where you poke your

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:49,000
documentation with their sleep so

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,190
analyze the current documentation and

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,590
then looks the differences down what is

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,230
what one lapses kind of a man you

00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:59,139
identified the documentation I'll get

00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,360
you the know views isn't a so no

00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:03,610
disobeys alone are people really

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,350
completely life it's reading them well

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,179
you know and they complete likes to lay

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,190
in see all those Saudis you've done now

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:11,320
look the differences between way the

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,929
position is mouth and really wants to be

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,769
based on your packet state rights so

00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:18,669
lowdown this different sleaze and then

00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,169
after not another's difference the next

00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,970
thing down is to tackle those

00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:24,010
differences we need to do some

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,630
approaches and processes to which this I

00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,340
get stiff because you kind of have it I

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,929
get sleep and expect that the next six

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,620
months even get slapped again you need

00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:34,389
to make some efforts or make some plans

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,220
and some processes to ensure you get

00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:38,169
there you can just say in the next six

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,380
months I want X and you know making any

00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:43,480
plans to get X right so ammunition to do

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,669
some some processes rights and like I

00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,769
mentioned earlier this process is will

00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:49,240
Barry I already mentioned my poking

00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,159
around he is a person of interest of

00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,899
course projects I understand your user

00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,940
personas don't understand your mind said

00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:57,010
well what do they want with a plantation

00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,500
now you have to clear on a standalone

00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,510
while you're doing so it's non tank

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,620
region to disapprove how can you improve

00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:07,210
it documentation Brian it's going to add

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,130
more links when it's introduced

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,110
something much more than text blindness

00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,909
it creates is separate and lineage

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,889
limitation we all need to add some

00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:16,779
animations like based on your simple the

00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:17,950
most surveys based on on all the

00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:22,240
analysis you've done so far now

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,710
attention and we already listed so many

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,590
of them

00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:28,559
now so and the next thing now is set up

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:30,330
a lake as it uses processes right so you

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,830
understand what to do now right you

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,299
outlined some places you want to face

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,309
and I want the next image to set up on

00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:37,350
the youtubes some of those processes and

00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:41,370
one finish in law when it comes to

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:43,799
Ezekiel engine fat small and hairy Isis

00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,960
limited so once it will fail the

00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,360
consequences police didn't consider an

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,429
old happy with next six months so like

00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,169
so you have a documentation rights right

00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,070
now like you just keep the budget and in

00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,480
the next three months

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,700
what do you think will happen to that

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,440
project what is a gravity documentation

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,539
is your documentation going to be

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,460
maintained by yourself or contributors

00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,940
we need to understand the whys as

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,529
English processes education plans that

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,060
karetai sustainability if you want your

00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,540
projects to continue in the next couple

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,510
months

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,820
so it's possible my planning - okay

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,460
they're going to get someone to ask

00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,230
admission 90 now my projects why needs a

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,730
beautiful onceá or so Alyssa consider

00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,859
all that how do i sustain my

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,629
documentation is something to consider

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:28,020
while to train and as it keeps in this

00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:30,270
process what plans come in and show them

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,369
what plans can you put in place to

00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:36,659
ensure that your project is sustainable

00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:39,629
right quality of our contents like

00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,669
political quantity like this I am NOT

00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:44,070
saying which is quality or you choose

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:45,990
constantly all I'm saying now is this

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,810
one very power projects they pull at my

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:50,970
lead quantity and manual image quality

00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,310
but let my need quality

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,440
unmannerly in quantity so let's say a

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,030
very popular project rights like I

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,070
mentioned be very complex to the tries

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,950
agenda you need to pass through one

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,780
stage to get set up for the like in it

00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,820
at all you need and not just come on

00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,680
once you let's see user projects that

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,359
involve a few rights its Joomla you

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,220
obviously are first to building some

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,720
kind of applies before but like you

00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,099
should have an idea mouth equalize work

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,750
possibly you have worked with unrest

00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,160
with you guys before they it's like yeah

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,650
you learn alright maybe but just

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,980
beginning she left you right so at that

00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,690
point you should prioritize quantity I'm

00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,460
sorry quality because like I don't

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,859
really make so much check I don't need

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,660
so many lens so fixed I have an idea of

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,099
what I am coming to do so what I want

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,600
this quantity documentation I hope I'm

00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,820
not confusing you I can get

00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,910
phillotson you need to provide quality

00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,950
at that point to your users so it means

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,660
to be so qualified that they can

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,550
understand William they're looking for

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,020
from you I got points but like for you

00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,810
to know the deal I maybe you might need

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,270
to add so much quantity of the petition

00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,400
because I need to understand what NPM is

00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:58,890
understand all the different activities

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,290
like only basic and visit and visit and

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,640
visit stop they're doing and now make it

00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,170
simple how do I ensure that I've

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,490
provided in addition for each user

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,160
consumers because you might not want to

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,870
have them or anyone like I mentioned we

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,490
might want even in between edition issue

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,800
your projects and then we have our

00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,810
tubules you can have a quick stats and

00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,640
that QuickStart is useful for people of

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,530
color to developers and experts and then

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,060
you might have like a full guide you

00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,190
know I have like a complex guy you might

00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,650
have a deep dive guide that you can have

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,380
show your guides that is like being a

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,510
and custom like abstracts about

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,160
information into different guides so

00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,900
like so beginners they want the full

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,760
guide right so we put all the entire

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,650
information game for developers you can

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,020
put gas in its facts guide that is

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,640
contains how deep and it will set up so

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,410
these are the kind of changes we should

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,170
also consider around your documentation

00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:48,770
and then one other thing that works best

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,180
is leverage and all that they ascribe

00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,920
text-based content is one typical to do

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,810
you need to introduce talks like digital

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,170
documentation the documentation should

00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,060
not only just be around text like you

00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,920
understand also that it is a personas

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,720
have different mindset I might know like

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,750
text so much right and when I come to

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,400
the plantation I am bored and then issue

00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,830
now the analysis you understand where

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,480
books is not savvy new it's possible to

00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,940
struggle in India but so fast

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,790
inconvenient because I hate text I'm not

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,710
uncomfortable reading some more steps am

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,450
I get tired like let's see fashion of

00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,540
being under the nutrition rights so

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,490
introduce all the techniques we show

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,070
documentation you can work in animations

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:33,000
and illustrations and videos you can

00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:35,190
introduce use cases I'm lazy product

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,850
being used so far introduce projects

00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,750
that are being dudes using your

00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,090
open-source product right show people

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,700
how your life is being used by the

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,950
global ecosystem sharing working samples

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,440
so like I am okay I put that prompt you

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:52,470
to do this principle that's okay

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,060
implemented so I have some working this

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,740
is an implementation we can just set up

00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,359
a sign books the concern looks at shows

00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,250
you outside remain siient I have to get

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,680
on something right and then I see

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,250
working sample and then you can also add

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,079
testimonials so a commission for like a

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,150
program manager my mindset and a point

00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,859
is to figure out if nice project works

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,650
well like if you look over my company

00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:15,510
and we find out find a fellow program

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,030
manager as a testimonial on the hood and

00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,619
I said oh I know this guy and it is I

00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,190
know this lady right and I'm like oh

00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,599
cool so long he has Jesus project and I

00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,980
can try it out because I believe it

00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,410
looks for human if you work from is like

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,940
it's how I'm the program manager and

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,859
that police to get you everyone's

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,410
community vision as simple and as fast

00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,970
as possible so you know me so let's go

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,589
back between each of the strategies look

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,780
familiar today the person falls between

00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:42,300
your user personas your mind search and

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,460
this launching those three and always I

00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,980
trade back and forth so understand that

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,569
each and every strategy you make is

00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,829
going to affect each and every user

00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:52,740
personally at least allowed to your

00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:54,270
project and the next thing to add is

00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,839
metrics recognition for financial

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,430
educators and let's see program managers

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,920
you want to see metrics right

00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,450
i ii you know i want to support a pilot

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,609
I need to understand that this is what's

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,349
important right and one way I can figure

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:13,740
out that this by magic show me how and

00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:17,579
we have 5,000 downloads we have and this

00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,230
is all that's like one year now and then

00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,660
we have which case watching that and all

00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,670
that so Abby's metrics for them because

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,530
each and every person I rely on

00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,060
different techniques and that's all you

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,099
need to do an analysis on your own so so

00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,109
if you have a documentation already now

00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:34,200
you need to go back to your books if you

00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:36,150
have possibly have anything we I treat

00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,040
them like yeah we evaluate your plans

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,480
again come again and say okay there's

00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,369
not enough pressure on documentation the

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,260
what's the best way to do that huh it's

00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:44,819
not me strategies together and then come

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,920
up with something new and like I

00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:50,250
mentioned earlier search me ballistics

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,720
is key you need to understand that there

00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,760
should be a sufficient planning and

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,450
community to maintain documentation a

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,040
bad product we buy I just try to check

00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,260
on the documentation and then I'm like

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,589
oh how to do x and y and then I check it

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,579
out and then I realize that

00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:07,349
recommendation is redundant already

00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:09,569
because let's say like last week the

00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,220
ship the new feature and then it's

00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:12,480
obsolete already so you need to

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,299
understand are you the communication

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,510
should skill why your project skills

00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:20,220
because it's one sad me that we it's

00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,010
possible that documentation was having

00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,799
users like drinks ago well now you've

00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:26,520
implemented a new feature and then

00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,410
something I was going to be implemented

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,690
in another way you need to secure your

00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,549
documentation while your product it's

00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,079
killing so I should not come to

00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,760
technician I didn't figure out that this

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:42,450
doesn't work anyone I'm like I have to

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:48,299
create an issue so I have which we don't

00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:50,130
answer it's not cool for users to ensure

00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:52,740
that you have a sufficient plan to

00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,970
maintain documentation and he can do

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,599
this in several ways you might have a

00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,859
small community of technical writers

00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,540
volunteer to help you you can have

00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,089
bouncing programs that if it's a very

00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,710
very huge two decks then they go for two

00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:06,599
people I just hope you put it in

00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,099
addition it's about programs run done

00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,900
now I was playing some at the end of my

00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:14,099
talk and then you can have all that and

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,839
then it plans so I'm what developers

00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,670
mostly do now I guess YouTube storm I

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,589
did the project and I just saw something

00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:22,079
messages I just like the documentation

00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:24,329
my slow and I'm like that's all right

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,319
but you need to understand that you need

00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:26,700
to make plans also for your

00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,930
documentation you need to understand

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,030
okay I need a volunteer

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:33,030
documentation maybe your friend might be

00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,950
anyone having these plans now insured

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,650
are you put their solution so sexual and

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:39,569
sustainable and then also once in

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:43,140
understand is viewed at least I run into

00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:45,839
nutrition and says this now attracts

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,150
collaborators Syria Vishal on the truth

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,780
help and simplify a contribution process

00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,190
so that we can have a communication and

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,559
one petal of some of the people it

00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,119
seemed like the documentation is really

00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,280
really awesome like it's just like an

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,930
entire department in stone so that it's

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,089
not all about and hinari none rights

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:06,869
enough code very small community of

00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:09,990
documentation expats beginners we then

00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:11,640
have them very stone together fix issues

00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,079
for you and all that's like the long

00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,099
when we find about your sustaining your

00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:19,739
projects okay

00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,179
yeah automation and track question issue

00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:22,589
like this is very important because in

00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,900
analysis you need to understand where

00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:26,249
you put the tools in the last week and

00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,079
we eight is now like I mentioned

00:42:26,249 --> 00:42:29,640
understand a target state and the

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,429
current state so one way to understand

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,019
this also is my track in your dish like

00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:35,400
fashion and your projects you

00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,439
documentation you need to be able to go

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,630
back and see bottom admonition looks

00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,039
like three years ago and understand okay

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,689
this is very way before this is where we

00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,959
answer yes

00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:48,599
so in show you how to install a tracking

00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:50,039
the changes and so quickly let's go on

00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,559
to some checklist how do you know if

00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,319
your documentation is bad very simple

00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,799
writes just about if your documentation

00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:59,699
level scale projects it's bad I

00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:02,249
mentioned this will be ensured our

00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,650
documentation skills which project and

00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:06,479
next is the documentation we pick stuff

00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,400
like you should not be repeatedly to

00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:10,739
leave everything and show your horizon

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,559
the imagination you can have quick start

00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,209
guide to guide give that guy like

00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,309
different guides for different personas

00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:20,039
writes why should not be seen the guide

00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:22,529
for the food the food and the food and

00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:24,209
the food a full guide in the Quick Start

00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:26,279
Guide bytes should know really complex

00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:28,049
liquid complex by and put a bit and

00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:29,789
patterns and different points I'll show

00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:31,380
you the map it's the fight and show you

00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:34,559
are supervising when you consider

00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,719
position right and the next is video

00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,699
documentation is so ambiguous like it's

00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,659
bad like I just considered with Hamlet

00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:44,880
part oh my god just so ambiguous up it

00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,589
should really not be cool and next to

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,739
documentation is not inclusive and not

00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:51,929
like it's not a commercial it may be

00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:53,969
than beginners visual standards anyway

00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,439
has really no idea of the projects we

00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:57,659
should ensure that you have some sort of

00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:59,159
guide for them to understand how will it

00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:01,769
work ambition there was optimism

00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:04,169
documentation and I literally defined

00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:04,409
like every single stock I used in it and

00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:08,039
all that

00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:09,779
Oh black does this does this this does

00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,789
that like I usually define all of them

00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:13,799
and added external links so I could

00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:15,529
categorize the advice and then any we

00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:18,329
can easily go the end understand that oh

00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:19,739
this is it even a standard occupation

00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:21,689
experience as much as you're putting

00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:24,089
time into engineering she put enough

00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:25,619
time also to finish up it's not just

00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:27,719
about bytes and readme files it's like

00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,029
an entire German it's only you need to

00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,940
put in enough focus to the same focus it

00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:35,009
puts in

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,229
takes the same level fine like

00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:39,239
autoscaler eventually information so far

00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:41,400
you can see our complex system be rights

00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:43,950
and then if it's missing the

00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,420
contribution guides is bad if he doesn't

00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,249
include support links how can I reach

00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,339
out to you for help or reach out to your

00:44:47,249 --> 00:44:52,979
community for help it's bad he doesn't

00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:54,809
respond to user issues in time and the

00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:55,319
original estimated time of response is

00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,970
bad

00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:59,489
I should not clip an issue meaning the

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,380
next one year at the receiver respond I

00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:04,079
understand it takes time and the process

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,210
around is like a showing lionesses are

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,999
all out here we are under availability

00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,519
at every point is very crucial so let's

00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:13,410
assume like in times when this digital

00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,420
dependent it around the world and the

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,979
unless you spend on sometimes family

00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,229
didn't have enough time in a box of an

00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:21,269
ad I will be unavailable at this point

00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:23,339
of the available around but since the

00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:25,229
results like armed solutions usually if

00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:28,079
you have any issues ensure you ask our

00:45:25,229 --> 00:45:30,089
check then the in this function so users

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,099
already comments the okay it's not

00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:33,720
variable now to be back by this time so

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,759
I can really just sit back and see my

00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,730
photos with our civil response and on

00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:39,410
pull backs right

00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,750
yeah that's fall around by the

00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,550
commutation so if your documentation

00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,380
wasn't satisfied that if you the

00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,780
communication has all this it's not

00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,120
really really bad so how do you know

00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,850
this definition is good

00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,370
the first one is defeats the

00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,260
communication is good it is an answer or

00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:01,220
this question the first question is why

00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:05,210
was this project created what problems

00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:08,060
does it so how can I get started its we

00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:11,240
as this product being used who are using

00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,130
a project some live use tests analysis

00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,720
of working some please writes and then

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,330
how connected you get your project if

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,220
you can answer these questions writes

00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,260
it's possible it's a good documentation

00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,060
so it is ensure that your community and

00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,300
answer all this question once you can do

00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:28,040
that like let's go and then I'll

00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,690
recommend some documentation to use it

00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,410
and you can use your projects you can

00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:35,300
check out some I don't know it's kind of

00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:40,700
verify your projects might be using

00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:43,190
Magnum or so the solution and you can

00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,530
use github also you can use any kind of

00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:48,670
food you want and one important so I

00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:51,350
usually recommend is kind of

00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:54,140
confirmation but that ensures to welcome

00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,120
and include all your computers and most

00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,800
times people forget to add to book when

00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,170
she boots to documentation you just say

00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,880
you just add the code into terms for the

00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,380
financial and protest like all

00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,630
controversial aren't often too because

00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,980
BOTS ensure that every kind of condition

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,800
is well conceived and check it out I'll

00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,740
just go off with us our provided links

00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,540
in my slide around 350 mm so what next

00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,700
now what she do now is to find

00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,190
documentation addition here project and

00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,080
prepare some booths because I don't know

00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,210
how much complex to the politician is

00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,130
but like simple undefined additionally I

00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,470
put the template person goes and then

00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:32,980
unit community are on location and then

00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:35,570
surely so what's he do this to be true

00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,370
so like I mentioned there's some

00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,900
programs around I would recommend he

00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,180
check out like Google pseudonym Docs

00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,690
it's like a program that ensures

00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:46,460
students on rope and help contributes to

00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,590
the commutation of the project so if you

00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,690
have any projects and then you need

00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,850
how-to documentation you can apply I

00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,830
think there's a session this year and

00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,390
then you can google would support C by

00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,370
bringing in students to work on your

00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,300
documentation check it out and if you

00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:03,040
use our educators and

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,080
good luck students appetite - only on

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,750
the widget to create Samsung and up

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,490
templates and like guides that you can

00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,500
use to and share your document agenda to

00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,660
take through select I'll show you my the

00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,100
one gene and oldest least complex how

00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,780
can I easily get started

00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,850
the Bulldog student is working on some

00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,470
kind of templates and like cook stuff

00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,150
you can easily just walk around and this

00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,520
oil since patterns and they'll just walk

00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,590
around and then this is a logo for arm

00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,440
WM or coach Peter sports I mentioned

00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:31,240
earlier and yeah so the documentation

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,890
should provide users with a roadmap to

00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:37,630
using the project right so documentation

00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,400
helps users to succeed with your

00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,420
software and it empowers them to be

00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,730
self-sufficient

00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,070
it enables them to give you for that

00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:46,660
remark and this is the organizational

00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:48,280
management of the projects because the

00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,650
user feedback believe is what will help

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,010
improve the product right so ensure you

00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,690
put in the same amount of time we put

00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,400
into engineering products in marble

00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,710
panels with in addition I'm sure you're

00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,840
putting a lot across to tonight's so I'm

00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:03,430
thank you so all of your listening thank

00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,710
you to icons if I got some of my

00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:10,410
illustrations again thank you to the

00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:13,720
organizers and thank you that's it

00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:16,150
okay thank you this is can break so I

00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:21,520
have a couple of questions for you are

00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:28,680
you ready yes yeah okay lovely here's a

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:32,590
question is excuse me Jackie he okay or

00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:35,610
okay the they seem to kinda strange

00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:40,330
order here so I'll do my best

00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:42,280
or how important do you think it is to

00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:45,130
translate documentation to other

00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:48,160
languages then English for example

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,740
Swedish Russian Chinese to people that

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,920
do not speak English

00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:57,340
yeah all right so I'm like I mentioned

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,710
earlier I only censured as you create

00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,140
some kind of strategies and illusions

00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,610
like I mentioned also each other is a

00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,100
person at home you see I put that in

00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:08,890
different mindsets price so if your

00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,840
project is only English let's say you're

00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:15,099
from England and then you speak English

00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:17,969
rights and they'll anthem let's see

00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:21,099
let's say from China lights as a Chinese

00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:23,319
you understand that I might not be able

00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:24,880
to filter all to the condition and since

00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,499
the analysis come in you need to

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,569
understand we hear your uses a comment

00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:30,969
from until the device you really know if

00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:32,829
it makes translation a lot so let's

00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:34,180
assume in person so be it doesn't

00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,519
analysis when you understand that you

00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,009
have like swings in Jesus coming from

00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:41,049
China you have like 50 users coming from

00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:42,759
India you understand that typically from

00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:44,829
different regions to be the greatest

00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:46,690
typical languages now way you can only

00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:48,699
say that oh I need translates like

00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,579
transmission is very important if your

00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:53,380
project needs is to analyze and awesome

00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:55,509
so then you understand liability limits

00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:01,959
this translates like it's very important

00:50:55,509 --> 00:51:07,299
and so how do I answer the passion okay

00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:10,479
next one is would documentation be best

00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:13,180
as fixed text with screenshots or videos

00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:16,509
on YouTube and where to best publish it

00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:22,719
on the projects weekly github page or a

00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:25,089
book okay it's quite similar to my

00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,859
answer ID understand what works best for

00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:28,479
your projects like by default every

00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:30,759
documentation is indexed writes like

00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:33,249
pasta falls well now if you understand

00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:35,499
that by text balloon that meditation is

00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:38,769
not affected in love please don't sob a

00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:40,089
little bit like am 50% huge impact bites

00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,949
you understand that you need to do

00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:43,839
something much more than just text it's

00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:45,309
understand okay so my users are

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,369
complaining that didn't really flow

00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:50,559
slowly text I want something visual or I

00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:51,940
want some work in some please it was

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,829
really quickly the shows me how to

00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,869
support I really want to see how this

00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:57,819
how this games use video bye-bye

00:51:55,869 --> 00:52:00,989
so I have a different mindset so just so

00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:03,099
being you also help you understand which

00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:04,569
strategy to implement so like they are

00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:06,819
several that links you can show you use

00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:08,769
illustrations and visuals and make up as

00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:10,509
lines I really love illustration so much

00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:12,459
so if I am in your documentation and you

00:52:10,509 --> 00:52:13,709
have some a traditional side on this way

00:52:12,459 --> 00:52:16,239
in case of check it out more and

00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:18,609
screencast videos show me on the set of

00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:20,859
results and then always up to the NPM is

00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:22,779
call these NPM install that because some

00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:24,759
scheme has the shows me you and I see a

00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:26,859
human working on even a and C is doing

00:52:24,759 --> 00:52:28,480
and I said I feel like I'm so on the

00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:30,310
spoke is my few

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,080
connected to the community like it's

00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,119
more it's variants are possible to them

00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,530
understand their presents gonna solely

00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:37,570
on the documentation and then come

00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:39,220
across am call me confirm the comics

00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:41,680
ever strategies and techniques atomic

00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:44,410
remains and then yes you can host a

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,080
mediation listener you can post your

00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,790
under t before I people this once and I

00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,820
recommend always like whatever Julian

00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,350
using most often they have an exhibition

00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:58,540
same is allows you to specific mutation

00:52:53,350 --> 00:53:00,070
we and stops like it's blue or couple

00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,230
other tools they allow it to go to the

00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:04,030
transition make it public so you can

00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:05,560
also get pushy because recognition a Lea

00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:08,020
and ensure that you are tracking any

00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,520
change are making and now will ya so if

00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,530
you have and more question certainly

00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:18,970
trust me after bindings after now I can

00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:21,310
answer questions I hope it's okay what

00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:25,690
do you think about organization

00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:30,460
conferences meetups like right the

00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:32,940
doctor org etcetera I think about these

00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,940
organizations

00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,050
excuse me

00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,490
and the question says what whites think

00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:46,750
about seducible musician sites

00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:49,960
yeah like www dot the docs dot org okay

00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:52,119
yeah some white dogs always an awesome a

00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,760
musician I have this I'm open source

00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:58,090
will attack how awesome paralyzing

00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:00,190
select it just lists provides in whose

00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:03,280
project organization see friendship

00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,930
house to include a 50-point since use

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,180
so one of the collisional nation in the

00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:09,930
Israeli dogs they have conferences you

00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,290
have podcast we organize around on

00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:13,450
documentation

00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,850
oh loads is my lovely rose at the

00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,590
end is events crystal you can attend -

00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,119
so listen to the podcast and some other

00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:21,310
of the initiative right so I would

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,020
recommend check out why the box and I

00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:25,540
also have some other places listed out

00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,160
English projects I wish a link I'm just

00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:32,549
after my talk and Nathan dogs I

00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:35,009
hope this helps okay and the

00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:38,519
question here in your experience which

00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:42,359
source project has the best

00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:45,410
documentation which Bullock has

00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:45,410
addressed the condition

00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:59,640
yeah-ha-ha isolation as a minute to the

00:54:51,539 --> 00:55:02,789
question though because obviously one I

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,329
can like I can boost off anytime

00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:08,160
it's got CGS right it's awesome Gilligan

00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:10,380
really awesome like I think that's the

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,259
night before now and then it was very

00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,329
easy like it's just amazing passage

00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:18,559
passages and then there's so much normal

00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:18,559
I colleges are fantastic

00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:26,849
okay I guess I will leave to you want to
