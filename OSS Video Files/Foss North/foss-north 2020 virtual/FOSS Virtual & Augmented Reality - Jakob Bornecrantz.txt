welcome to force north the virtual

00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:08,339
edition we would like to thank all our

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,360
sponsors and partners in this difficult

00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:15,860
situation our gold sponsors look soft

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,029
and ansible by Red Hat

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,270
our silver sponsors ITRs group and make

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:25,920
it right

00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,980
our base sponsors

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,170
our partner projects the open source

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,290
community and the region of Gothenburg

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,239
and a huge thanks to our awesome

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,380
community this would not have been

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,380
possible without you

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,199
hello and welcome my name is akia

00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,660
programs and I'm going to start talk

00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:52,199
about false virtual and augmented

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,489
reality with a focus on monado and open

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,370
XR as I said my name is Jacob

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,030
Rance these so my contact information

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,899
it's I'm gonna you those are links and

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,659
you can click on them when you download

00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:12,450
the slides what I'm gonna talk about

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,720
today is basically a quick introduction

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,649
to what a or and B or ease out bit about

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,380
open X or manaro giving a status update

00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:25,520
on Minato and then doing some demos

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,520
unwrapping the whole thing up

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:36,960
what is mental reality you know a or

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,840
basically I have the very simple a

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,390
definition of the word augment you know

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:50,690
it's to build upon and make greater so

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,849
what is that in concrete examples say

00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,399
you know the app Pokemon go is actually

00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:59,190
an a or application where you can you

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,830
know overlay the pokemons on top of the

00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,440
real world it's probably the example

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:08,479
that most people have actually come into

00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:12,090
contact with but it can be also be used

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:17,370
in like work so this is a daiquiri

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:20,690
headset where the user sees you know the

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,370
little for the window and isn't in a

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,340
conversation with a operator on the side

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,019
and the per the operator can actually

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,360
see what the person is seeing through

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:34,110
the cameras of the headset and it can

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,150
actually draw on the real world so you

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,739
know you see this little red circle

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,690
there's actually something that the

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,670
operator has drawn on the real world and

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,739
it's sort of a it stays there in the

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,989
real world just like I'm using the

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,519
pointer about even though it's virtual

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,920
pocket or you know like to highlight

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
that you can highlight things in the

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,530
real world

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,160
so for instance in you know you can see

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,830
this is a computer rack

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,400
and I can highlight there pull out this

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,050
hard disk or you know press this button

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,500
or don't press this button

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,240
no no you know cross cross that will you

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,260
know - I turn a whole computer off or

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,150
like don't you know don't push this

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,710
button on this because control panel

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,770
that you don't know anything about that

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:23,080
I know a lot about and circus or bar up

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:30,400
with people's knowledge of technical

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:33,190
things and then what is virtual reality

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,920
and I'll really like the quote that I

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,740
originally thought was actually Adam

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Savage code but exactly from dungeon

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:47,290
master a movie where you go so you know

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,470
I react you're a substitute my own where

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,690
it's essentially up substituting your

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,900
entire reality so what do you really

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,560
think about them is you know games it's

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,800
a classical example where you know you

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,290
know VR game something like that but if

00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:11,470
you think about it like in the things

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:13,930
when I showed a are Pokemon Co regular

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,610
old games are also actually virtual

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,669
reality if you follow the sort of a

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:27,040
textbook doctor and called textbook

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:33,419
definition of it so what do you get when

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,419
you combine the two you get a or and VR

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:42,730
so we say X or is what we mean either a

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:46,590
or augmented or virtual reality and not

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,590
extended reality

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:57,270
open XR and to start with open Xsara is

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,890
gonna talk about how do we actually do X

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,570
or I like a higher level and you can see

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,920
that you have your program and your - I

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:12,060
have a platform that you run the program

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:14,960
and the hardware and between the program

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,340
and the platform you have an API and

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,230
this API you know would be good if it

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,790
was portable so you can run on different

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:27,060
platforms and different hardware but you

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,320
know as you might have remembered in

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,760
past if you're and you know I think

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:36,030
everybody here has their own API and you

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,660
know different hardware and some

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,390
application only support some API I saw

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,520
that so you can see that's clearly not a

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:50,870
good situation and there's some a whole

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:56,000
bunch of companies involve oculus epic

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:59,400
unity all got together and started a new

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,620
API and that will be common for all of

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,980
this platform and this API was open XR

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:11,280
so what what's cool about the thing and

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:16,770
it's just like VGO and welcome and so

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,450
it's made by Kronos is out now and one

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,610
of the things that I think is the most

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:25,260
important and best things with this is

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:27,900
that it's action based so you give more

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,060
information to the runtime or words

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,980
actually you want to do with your

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,710
actions so you don't hardcore things to

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,170
certain input devices so you become even

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,740
portable over input devices and of

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:49,220
course there are a force implementation

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:54,440
with for open XR because now we're not

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:58,090
tied to a certain API or burden by it so

00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:03,130
we kind of welcome there

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:06,910
and to Deep Diver with armed actions and

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:11,000
the type of the controller that you are

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:14,570
using is not in focus it's more the type

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,700
of the action and as I said allotted to

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:21,430
you give more context from the program

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:25,400
to the runtime and then we can decide

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,380
what a button do to a certain action or

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,560
nollie maybe not even a button but

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:36,410
certain types of inputs so as I've

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:42,560
mentioned before going to talk about not

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:48,500
as well it is again looking back at how

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:51,520
do we do X or Y a and where a lot of

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,470
fits in int you know it's a platform

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,750
that sits between the program exposes

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,210
the open extra API and talks to the

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,100
hardware

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,000
sort of a more detailed look on it you

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:09,640
can see there's a sort of arm platform

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,900
code check of code which takes cares of

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,680
deciding what this platform should be or

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,170
like what what the hardware platform you

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,070
want to talk to and the operating

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:26,060
systems we have drivers for various

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:28,750
hardware and we also have a compositor

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,110
and this is not to be confused with a

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:36,620
boiling compositor or x11 compositor

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:38,000
even though they are basically doing at

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,830
some level of thinking which is

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,200
compositing different we'll hear some

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:49,250
top of which other windows but but a

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,620
picture is more complex you know we have

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:57,260
a whole bunch of other parts that sit

00:08:51,620 --> 00:09:00,880
there both outside of and our of monado

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,670
but also of you know internally so the

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,240
various pieces of code talk to each

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,810
other and there's a bunch of axes record

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:19,439
on the side

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:22,680
I think like that so another way to look

00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:24,779
at this and if this way you can see you

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,050
have your program on top and the

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:33,240
openings are stay tracker which is what

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:36,149
talks to which the program talks to and

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,439
and then talks to all of the internal

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:44,100
interfaces explained away sort of things

00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:46,379
so part of the design goal is to push

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,379
complex things or complex state tracking

00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,480
things that we that us driver developer

00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:56,879
doesn't really want to you know have to

00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:00,449
deal with interest rate tracker and it

00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:03,809
takes cares of say some point in the

00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:06,240
future we would change the API open xrap

00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:08,999
i or a new functionality i mean you have

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,199
to support the older way of doing new

00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:14,790
things doing things um open xrs they're

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,189
all the state tracker we done also take

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:23,009
care of implementing that functionality

00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:25,709
or that legacy functionality for us so

00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:27,899
the drivers can use only the new way and

00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:37,170
don't have to care about their whole way

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:39,180
and you can see you can sort of stack

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:43,920
these things on top of each other and so

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,139
we're oh right now are working on an IP

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,769
c layer so we can move the compositor

00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:54,240
and all of the drivers out of process so

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:55,889
we can and then have a from this out of

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,699
the process of the actual application

00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:02,160
and you can have you know you can jump

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:04,970
between different programs likes our

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,970
programs

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,880
hmm and if you can see here there's a

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,770
couple of things that starts with X or T

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,720
here next to the arrows between the

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,210
different boxes so you have exactly

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,000
prober and accepting device and X of T

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,470
after you can posture and I'm gonna talk

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,840
about them now because they are part of

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:33,490
what we call the X or T interfaces so

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:38,080
that's how the internal interfaces in

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:41,290
Manado they seek between different

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,510
components some of the accelerate code

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,380
has their own interfaces which are not

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:50,500
exactly interfaces but they are yeah

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,280
explore more in that place it's purely C

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,940
and and it's not stable because what our

00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:01,000
understanding if so the interfaces of

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,130
this are made to be what the hardware or

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,430
what the functionality we require or

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:10,390
currently and our understanding of that

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,910
is going to be wrong in some way you

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,920
know either we just thought prominently

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,380
of what the current situation is or we

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,110
didn't foresee how the hardware is going

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,930
to change in the future so we don't want

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,060
this to be stable because then we know

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,850
we have to buy right legacy code on both

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,800
sides of the interface and instead we

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,030
want to push that up into the state

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,560
tracker so we don't want to shape we

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:41,950
want to may be able to make sure that

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:45,910
the API is not stable and flexible so we

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:49,290
can change it and since we don't have to

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:52,240
make it stable we can also make it

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,400
easier to use because we know we don't

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,490
have to put in certain flexibility into

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,870
it we can sort of make it's very

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,970
straightforward and fixed which makes it

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,210
easier to later on and use it on both

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,210
sides

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:18,600
so the xrt device is basically a device

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,220
it could be a controller this is a

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,060
controller

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:27,420
it could be a hmd when you know the

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,640
thing that you put on your head it's

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,760
built around not an inheritance

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,980
structure so instead it has these

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:41,360
optional structs which become sort of an

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:45,240
aspect so say you have a device with a

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,390
item D device so we have your pace AMD

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,910
device and then you want to put a camera

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,570
on this item D so then you you know

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,970
extend that AMD and you have an item D

00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:01,260
with camera class so if you do this with

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,850
the regular in terms of structure but

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:07,050
what if you have a controller with the

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:10,890
camera on you know do we that's not an

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,720
18 d do you have a camera controller you

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,140
know a controller with camera off there

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,820
so instead it wouldn't burn to your

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,060
stamp this optional spot that we can

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:27,120
hang on to a thing to a device and make

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,830
it so that any device could implement

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,830
any acts aspects

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,600
when it comes to functions that are

00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:41,199
exposed on the struct or objects we have

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,509
input sync output settings or you can

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,589
activate the rumble features on the

00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:50,459
controllers and we also can call into

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:56,980
and get the view and positional

00:14:50,459 --> 00:15:00,130
positions and they are wealthy they are

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,550
functions and not feel that we read from

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:07,949
it because we need to be able to giving

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,769
item stamp that the application wants to

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:13,750
application wants to use because they

00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,240
want to do prediction so they're

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,480
basically asking for a timestamp in the

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:24,279
future and so then we can do prediction

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,940
inside of the device driver and there's

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:30,399
also a whole bunch of immutable

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,360
information from it so which type of

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,790
outputs we don't expect controllers to

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,829
you know be able to add buttons or

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,589
remove buttons there you know they are

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:46,889
fixed and also which tracking system

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:53,260
origin there they are in and then for

00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:57,000
the for the HMDs there's screen position

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,000
on our distortion information as well

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:07,240
for the compositor and I'm gonna skip

00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:12,069
ahead a little bit here there's this

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,810
this is using a base class you know a in

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:17,470
how the structure instead because I've

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,180
got no feet feeling mmm the real

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,339
compositor is actually yesterday father

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,180
should become file descriptor based on

00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:28,660
where as we have different capacitors

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,399
and subclasses for OpenGL and welcome so

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,350
those are two API that we support

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,290
rendering apparently support in below

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,860
them and also use wrappers around the

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,860
compositor

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,010
and the proverb which is sort of odd

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,670
that thing that was called the platform

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:57,339
part of the code holds a lot of the

00:16:52,670 --> 00:17:00,829
policy and how to set up all the entire

00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:06,020
hours called VR system that you want to

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:09,079
use so this is just mostly a whole bunch

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,870
of miscellaneous code that we need to

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,500
throw together and that needs to be able

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,709
to reason about the whole system it's

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,870
used mostly by the urban exercise

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:23,720
tracker in your says hey I definitely

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,610
associated hey I won't do no type of

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,970
system you know multiple devices over

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:33,400
here or just give me a system that I can

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:35,650
use but it also has a lot of the

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,940
abstractions for the platform of

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,940
operating systems I think that so

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:47,690
abstracting away how to Emma numerate

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:51,830
USB dove buses for you know the display

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:54,410
the device drivers and this is probably

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,700
the part of the interface that needs a

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,210
bit of refactoring and we probably

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,970
should split it up into and again as you

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,260
can see how the function is just

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,620
listening devices like taking the

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:15,679
devices and linking video devices and a

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:23,090
bunch of miscellaneous stuff so the

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:25,880
stages of minato we we have mostly

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,370
complete open excel support and there

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,700
are some basic functionality in the

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:35,330
compositor and that we need to add the

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,100
pastor is currently in process but it's

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,270
a portion math shading and all those

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:43,460
fancy feature we have a nice fairly nice

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,380
video processing framework I'm not sure

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:49,100
how long this will survive in me from

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,980
moving on to editing Health's we can

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,590
track the PS Move controller and we also

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,320
have a really nifty debug your eyes and

00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:05,280
I will demo

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:07,790
for the robbed when it comes to hardware

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,960
support we have a whole bunch of them

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:14,760
the most notable one I think is like

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,800
weird have it pushed and up relative

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,280
purchase for the PlayStation VR and pace

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:25,190
in the movie we also have a North Star

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:29,730
support which is a open source AR device

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:38,040
that was contributed by a community

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:41,790
member we also added a mmm it's not an

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:44,580
experimental but an experiment a driver

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,150
for experimentation for Arduino devices

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,410
I will talk a little bit more about that

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:53,370
we also have support for a tabling

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:56,160
controller the u.s. we are hke the vibe

00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:00,170
and the index and we can also support a

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:05,360
whole bunch of all all the devices that

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:05,360
through the open AMD interface

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,270
so they are do notarized driver is

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:22,860
whatever called not a consumer driver

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:24,750
and it's not meant for you no use so

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,299
it's more of a template that you can

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,450
learn about another device drivers and

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,820
then you can experiment so with this

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,820
you're actually getting the source code

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,650
for the device itself and you can sort

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:42,230
of changed and qoodles around and play

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:46,169
around with it and provide a nice little

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,179
experimental playground for you so the

00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:52,260
currents of only supported or Breno

00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:56,040
device is the nominal 333 ble parkway

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,750
you know probably gonna expand as we get

00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:08,040
moral and we can play around with and

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:11,419
different ways to use it so code and you

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:16,100
can see there's a couple of crossed our

00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:16,100
numbers here and these are from

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:21,390
beginning of February at FOSDEM and so

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:25,350
these are sort of the changes as you

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,880
iguales can see we have gained a a total

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:31,679
of nine thousand lines of code

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:35,030
um but as you can see the try the amount

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,160
of triberg and nitro code has actually

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:43,200
been reduced and but we have actually

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,809
gained three more new drivers and this

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,540
is you can see sort of our see hey I

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,100
would handy to add more drivers and then

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,410
reduce the number of lines of code and

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:56,340
we have done some refactoring and

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:59,610
pulling out of common code patterns and

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,230
that was you know we were seeing the

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:06,270
same driver the drivers over and over

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:10,919
again and turn them into common code you

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:13,530
can see we also extracted away some code

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,370
from the compositor into more

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,720
commonplace but we perceived that the

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,440
compositor will grow

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,090
soon and as you can see the auxiliary

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,020
code races over all of the helper

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:32,070
functions as then grown same with the

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:35,010
state trackers and the targets are

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,760
basically a whole bunch of glue code

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:46,890
that binds everything together into a

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:49,200
single binary so this is kind of a

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:53,850
little bit of a roadmap but also not

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:57,480
really just what we at kelabra are

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,190
planning for and so you know this is not

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,320
the entire community what they are

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,640
planning to do and so we want to finish

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,250
up the open extra support make the

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,650
complete improve the PS Move tracking

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,770
and actually add a positional PSV or

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,750
tracking and then follow up wing on that

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,270
we will stop working on lighthouse

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:19,980
tracking and night essays four and the

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:23,539
five in index and also you know some

00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,539
other devices that are out there and

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:31,760
then we will also do move the capacitor

00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,760
out of process as I mentioned before

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:43,940
even further out we have to think on

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,559
sort of eye uses experience things and

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,570
building a safe space and with safe

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,330
piece I mean something is really really

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,210
small and that can run in background and

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:57,720
then say your application crashes things

00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:01,679
just don't turn black you end up in a

00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,169
safe space we need system UI so for

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,490
those that are used say steamvr you

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,559
press a button you know press your home

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,380
button and you end up in a you know

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:12,299
system or in this case it's this deep

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,440
seam interface so that would be

00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:22,799
something we need we will also need to

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:26,250
add a setup UI to make it more user

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,700
friendly right now it's a little bit you

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,700
know programmer

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,769
it brought a real the whole programmer

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,630
experience to get it up and running so

00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:38,700
this is something we also want to work

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:40,990
on and all work on Maya a or and slam

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,490
which is probably isn't something that's

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:48,630
gonna be a lot of work don't lie and so

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,690
now I'm gonna be showing off some demos

00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:57,179
I'm gonna start with a simple tracking

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,179
demo showing off the PS Move tracking

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,730
so now we have Y a couple live I will

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,320
just shift over to his scream so the

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,900
scene is yours okay

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,150
thank you very much sorry about that and

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,960
that was my OBS sort of that I had

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:19,230
forgot to verify a bit so I will take it

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,710
off from the live demo of the tracking

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:33,870
system

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:35,640
I thought go what I'm showing now is the

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:39,870
small hello

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:43,290
XOR application that's sort of a part of

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:48,690
the open X or SDK so it's very simple

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:51,720
and you just a show of a simple open

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,990
excellent location currently I don't

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,330
have a headset connected so it's using a

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,840
sort of a dummy device you can see this

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:03,240
a stereo view and then there's more a

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,790
couple of things that move around here

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:11,760
and this is I don't know if if my camera

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:14,700
in me shown or it's just my screen share

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,230
exact issue I so it's only your screen

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,110
share do you want to get on screen then

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,300
I can look into how to make you visible

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:27,450
and now you're sliding onto the screen

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:30,840
now you're okay yes

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,000
so this is tracking a PlayStation Move

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,990
controller I'm going to hold up from the

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,950
face here eh

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:41,400
I might have moved around like this and

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:45,720
what this is tracking exactly using a

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:48,600
small stereo camera yeah and we can sort

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,860
want to take the the bowl on this and

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,500
track it in space

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,420
Kenickie now I'm going to hold this

00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:04,820
still when I'm gonna move around the

00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:04,820
camera instead act like a edu or ease up

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:20,720
okay Alex benedi are you still there

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:22,520
am I still alone I guess not so the demo

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:29,390
is gone but we still see you and your

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:33,230
yep and now I'm going to show off deep

00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:42,440
debug you right which has a lot a lot of

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:43,550
things going on here okay so you see

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,830
there's all bunch of numbers flying

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:51,560
around and things going on the most

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,540
important thing I want to show off is

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:59,090
that we can do like a lot of tracking of

00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:03,050
the compositor latency or think frame

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:05,420
timing you can see it's the really the

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:09,140
window is running on he just stopped

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:12,950
sync so it's only 60 fps and it's

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,960
usually a lot more stable than this so

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,850
it's probably be recording and actually

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,800
making everything a bit laggy here and

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,140
there but we can clearly see it's mostly

00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,610
stable and then sometimes yeah there we

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:30,530
go it takes up over here we have on the

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:36,830
left side we have the various part of

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:39,470
the tracking system so we have the sort

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:43,100
of the camera device and the latest C

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:45,560
between the first pixel being sent to

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,650
the computer and the actual buffer being

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:53,570
completely sent over USB so you can

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:56,480
that's about 20 and 16 milliseconds

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:58,130
latency just from it just takes to send

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,650
the picture from the camera to the

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:06,560
computer and for now here we have a

00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:11,630
ats-v filter which is hue saturates

00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:13,490
value filter which singles out a certain

00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,280
color or a certain spectrum of colors to

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,200
appear only interesting so to

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:22,940
demonstrate that we can

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:28,100
well we don't make this beer and we can

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,480
see the input from the camera so and you

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,289
can see it's ever has a very low

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,679
exposure so no that's not really much of

00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:37,220
me there I can actually do oh do I want

00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,850
to do that

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,669
yes increase the exposure and then you

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:47,690
see me and I can do that

00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:49,429
and I can go it down break it down

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,440
because the camera is really only

00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:55,759
interested in we're only really really

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,739
interested in the actual all on the this

00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,100
device here and you can see below here

00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:03,980
that we have this is they say free

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,350
filter input and afterwards so me all

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,529
things rest in color red so everything

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,389
else is just you know not removed and

00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:18,679
this is what's being sent into the

00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:23,239
actual tracking device tracking code and

00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:26,359
this is the tractor and you might not be

00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:27,859
able to see but there's a slight round

00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,539
circular lead and that's where the

00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,859
tractor is detecting in this circle so

00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:38,690
we were basically only tracking a severe

00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:40,539
that's man that's how we do that some

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:45,559
cool other stuff we can do we can also

00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:46,940
talk to the the seam of the device that

00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,519
this device the state of the device

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,940
driver as well so you can see here old

00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:55,129
evolve values that we get from the IMU

00:30:51,940 --> 00:31:00,350
is seeing if I shake it around the Excel

00:30:55,129 --> 00:31:06,009
motor of course crazy but we can also

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:06,009
control it so I'm let's see exactly

00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:15,409
let's see what I can control the color

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:17,149
of the LED that's on top of it then you

00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:19,879
can also see here as I change the colors

00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:22,359
to be you know purple it goes away in

00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,359
the filter

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,500
if I open the purple filter and I turn

00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,950
purple it shows up so this means we can

00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,450
also tweak the values a safe place to

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,800
say we have this purple and you know

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,450
it's not really tracking math well we

00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:46,030
can tweak it to become perfect saying it

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:50,530
red and all that stuff so yeah so this

00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:52,060
UI allows us to really debug live which

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,820
is really good because then you can sort

00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,590
of see connection between oh hey

00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,970
tracking is going bad when I move it

00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:03,570
away and things like that so we want to

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:08,410
build on this so it becomes even more

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:15,640
better for people to use and this is a

00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:17,800
link to a video that in case of breakage

00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,840
and some stuff that you can also watch

00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,730
if you only have the slides so I think

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:28,110
that hopefully works in the export

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:33,850
version as well to wrap up a bit a

00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:39,910
little bit of rants where it says always

00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:45,070
a good thing to have so me debugging or

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:51,130
working with VR and plugging a whole lot

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:55,210
of had had such nothing cloud and it

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:57,310
really no shell has is very bad at

00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,330
handling hot fog especially with non

00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,430
desktop devices

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,900
it doesn't ignore them and boom my

00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:06,640
windows around which is really super

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:08,380
annoying internal is missing some OpenGL

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,160
extensions to make it work on the model

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:15,480
we need this extension for that so

00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,480
that's sort of a name and shame

00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:22,679
some thoughts and there's lots of work

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,650
ahead of us

00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:32,789
during VR is actually really hard or a

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:34,799
or even it's especially all of the

00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:37,980
tracking which is really hard to figure

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,900
out it's also it's actually fairly easy

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:46,799
to figure out how to talk to a headset

00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:49,049
but I'd say the distortion and tracking

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,490
part of it actually you know sitting

00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:54,809
down and understanding the math and

00:33:50,490 --> 00:34:00,510
doing all that is really a lot of work

00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:02,789
and fairly you know complex some of the

00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:07,409
things that we also thinking about is

00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:11,159
how do we do you a user face user space

00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:14,429
or user fate and facing interfaces do we

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,540
do something of our own or do we provide

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:22,440
a library that can almond KDE projects

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,720
can interface to and setting UI or do

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,929
Konoe Mancari do their own system your

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,970
eyes for VR and how do we you know

00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:37,200
switch between apps is that something

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:40,470
that no one can take care of but one of

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,849
the most important things I think of all

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:48,960
of this is we want to build a community

00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:52,950
for open-source X or you know not just

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,609
for driver for tri writer so people do

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:58,920
working with drone tracking or no all of

00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:00,540
us doesn't like to deep down in deep

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,310
dive into you know the nitty-gritty

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,010
things there's also a whole bunch of

00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:09,690
stuff that actually goes on top of that

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:11,640
work how do we talk to how to build a

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:16,500
community for people doing experiences

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:19,800
programmers we want at least me and me

00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,020
and collaborates the future of X are to

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,349
be open source and we want to press us

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,940
to become of everybody's life and to

00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:31,599
toot our own horn

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,579
we are hoping to hold we hold a fostex

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,280
our conference last year I'm hoping to

00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:38,140
hold another one this year we'll see

00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:45,099
with all the things that going cell goes

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:47,109
on yeah maybe it's an online event but

00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:49,660
we had it in the end of the year so

00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:53,109
we're hopefully most of these things

00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,150
will blow over here and this slide is

00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:57,339
just a whole bunch of links you can

00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:01,089
download this slide deck and like them

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:03,720

I don't I don't know the specifics but

00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:15,190
I'm sure that Johann has told everybody

00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:19,930
how to ask me questions down directly on

00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:22,869
possum and especially thanks for your

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:27,309
hand too for hosting this event even

00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:30,910
though you know all of the things going

00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:35,380
on with the pandemic so thank you you

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:39,369
one and thank you everybody focusing we

00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:41,349
have two questions the first one is how

00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:43,869
well integrated is this in the open

00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:46,539
game engines such as Google and that's

00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:48,940
follow up by also is there anything else

00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:53,890
I'm not sure if it's DL even knows what

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:58,150
a RvR is so see that's sort of a

00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:01,989
question I know of the the core

00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:05,589
developers working on a open X or VR

00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:10,059
backend for grow I know I have I don't

00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:12,940
know if it's landed yet or if it's just

00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:16,869
being worked on but yeah I remember

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,969
seeing like a week ago a a branch /

00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:22,239
marché request about integrating open

00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:26,829
access support so this will make good oh

00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:30,719
yeah work on this there's support Rupa

00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:34,329
nectar in unreal but they don't have it

00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:37,569
supported on Linux yet

00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:41,109
I remember hearing somebody working on

00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:43,349
that hopefully working on it and so

00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:48,339
hopefully it should be in unreal as well

00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:50,829
and it has also landed in open access

00:38:48,339 --> 00:39:00,400
for a sauce land in blender so you can

00:38:50,829 --> 00:39:05,979
use that yeah so for that for STL no

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:10,769
with them hmm in some sense open XR is a

00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:12,849
lot what both STL is as well not really

00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:16,920
maybe window management and all the

00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:20,680
stuff but as an extra takes care of

00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:27,969
input and access to the devices that way

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:30,519
and it's also platform independent so or

00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:32,890
well you're supposed if you write to

00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:36,819
just like you've write an application to

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:39,579
STL you also you price it through open

00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:46,599
Excel then you can deploy your multiple

00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:48,789
platforms and the the second question is

00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,019
from YouTube so how is the computer

00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:54,109
detecting the PlayStation Move

00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:57,380
controllers so okay let's

00:39:54,109 --> 00:40:02,480
so as you probably saw in the demos it

00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:05,029
just detects the actual ping-pong ball

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,239
that's on top of it so that this thing

00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:12,950
lights up in a color and then I assure

00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:16,759
you just take the you know the rooks

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:21,460
that collar and looks for basically

00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:25,309
everything all the spheres on the screen

00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:27,769
of that color and hopes it finds the

00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:29,329
right one which most of the time it is

00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:31,489
because that's basically the only thing

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:35,809
that's actually bright enough and also

00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:38,749
circular enough and the device itself is

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:41,720
just a regular Bluetooth device so you

00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:43,400
have to pair it with the computer I just

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,549
like you would pair a you know

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,809
playstation controller and let there's a

00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:50,839
special program for that but we're

00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:53,539
hoping to actually make it and integrate

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,980
that into the Blues component because

00:40:53,539 --> 00:41:00,880
that has a so you have to actually

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:03,200
connect it to the computer by USB and

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,029
but but yeah we're hoping to just make

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,789
that so you know just plug it in with a

00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:10,430
USB connector and loose would actually

00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:12,259
pop up by a window saying hey do you

00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,329
have to wear this and your class just of

00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:17,749
nowhere and automatically pair it for

00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:20,029
you so yeah we're hoping to make that

00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:22,789
easier because now you have to run this

00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:26,930
special command from the command line

00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:31,220
which Polly isn't that nice so yeah I

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:33,619
think that's hopefully how ask your

00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:38,299
questions to dig further into it if you

00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:42,739
want to I we are using open CV from

00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:46,069
basically most of our attracting so we

00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:51,739
stormed out without HSV example and then

00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:54,829
block tracking there but we wrote our

00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:57,140
own essays we sub filter but we are

00:41:54,829 --> 00:42:01,099
using the block tracking from within CV

00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:04,430
so if you basically search open CV block

00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:06,680
tracking you will find very simple a you

00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,900
know fairly good examples on how to do

00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,210
this on your purview

00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,910
and then we sort of integrated all of

00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:16,880
that together and or you know

00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:22,790
integrating the I new values making a

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,530
whole stack from that nice thank you and

00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:27,170
I think that was the last question so

00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,960
thanks a lot for for your show and

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:33,079
especially the live demo at the end that

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,540
was a bit of a scramble thank you very

00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:37,540
much and enjoy your day

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,350
and with that I would like to thank our

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,800
speakers our sponsors and all our

00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,800
viewers
