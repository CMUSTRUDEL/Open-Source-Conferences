welcome to force north the virtual

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,919
edition we would like to thank all our

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,969
sponsors and partners in this difficult

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:15,469
situation our gold sponsors look soft

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:19,640
and ansible by Red Hat

00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:21,860
our silver sponsors ITRs group and make

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,520
it right

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:28,580
our base sponsors

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,770
our partner projects the open source

00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,890
community and the region of Gothenburg

00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,930
and a huge thanks to our awesome

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,920
community this would not have been

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,940
possible without you welcome to force

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,770
north this morning we will start with

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,540
Gabriel who will talk about the reuse

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:53,270
project so Gabriel the stage is yours

00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:56,360
yeah thank you you're on so thanks for

00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,870
having me here online I hope everyone is

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,060
staying healthy and keeping safe to give

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,030
you an introduction my name is Gabriel I

00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,410
am the legal coordinator for the Free

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,130
Software Foundation Europe

00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:14,509
yeah fsfe here in Berlin full disclosure

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,160
I am NOT a developer I am a lawyer so my

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,759
interest when working with free software

00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,820
is to try to ensure that the rights of

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,119
individuals both developers and users

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,030
are upheld when they participate in a

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,459
digital society so the more technical

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,619
aspects of coding and programming will

00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:38,630
tend to escape me and yeah I apologize

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:42,860
to that the fsfe we are a nonprofit

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,630
organization we that empowers users to

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,670
control technology

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,020
more specifically we advocate for the

00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:53,420
use of free software to do that so today

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,550
I would like to talk to you about two of

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,860
the projects that the fsfe is currently

00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,130
working on the first project is called

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,750
reuse and this reuse project is also a

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,890
big part of the second project that I

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,280
will talk about called the

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,910
next-generation internet so what is

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,050
reuse basically reuse is an initiative

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:19,459
of the fsfe that aims to make reusing

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:22,459
software code easier for everyone right

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:25,400
so if we were all in Gothenburg right

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,170
now at this point I would have asked for

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
a show of hands on some questions but

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,000
since that's not really possible right

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,120
now I'm going to make some assumptions

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
here about you all instead so first I'm

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,400
going to assume that almost all of you

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,379
have programmed code before

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,680
my second assumption is that many of you

00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:47,290
here have had the experience of

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,540
releasing quote some code as free

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,140
software before and my final assumption

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,950
is that almost everyone here has at some

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,139
point or another been confused about how

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:04,269
to properly license their free software

00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:07,090
code now on this third point the fact

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,989
that it's difficult for people to easily

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,169
grasp how to properly license their code

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:16,659
is a bit of a problem yeah in order to

00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:19,569
maintain a thriving ecosystem of free

00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,849
software in order to make sure that we

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,889
are able to share our work to ensure

00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,469
that users of your software get to enjoy

00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:30,489
the four freedoms of free software to

00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:31,989
use study you share and improve we need

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,540
to make sure that your software is

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:38,349
properly licensed so what does this mean

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,530
this basically means that license and

00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:45,370
copyright information must be freely

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:49,180
available or other developers to find to

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,790
understand and to comply with when they

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,479
inspect and when they want to reuse your

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,299
code and yeah this becomes a hindrance

00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,079
or it becomes a roadblock to properly

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:06,069
reusing code and for generally just the

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,979
the spread of free software when people

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,590
are unsure or unaware of how to properly

00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:15,280
do this how to properly you know license

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,750
your code and how to properly find this

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,220
information to comply with how to

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:23,389
properly communicate this information

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:25,189
basically so some of the

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,860
common difficulties that people face

00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:30,499
when they try to do their free software

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,289
licensing if you look at my slide here

00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:35,539
as you can see my first point is where

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:37,550
to put the information about the license

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,789
that you've chosen for your software

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,729
project now the license that you've

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:46,999
chosen for your software represents a

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:49,340
freedom that you've exercised yeah this

00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:52,879
is the this is the freedom of choosing

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,330
the terms on which other people can use

00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,300
your software and yeah if you've taken

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,770
the effort to make this choice if you've

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,020
made the effort to pick a license you

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,590
would want to make sure that users of

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,849
your software know about these terms but

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,949
where do you put this information about

00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,840
the license that you've chosen so that

00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,090
people can easily find it so that people

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,060
can easily understand these terms that

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:20,210
you've chosen so do you put the full

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,839
license of the full license text into

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,699
your repo do you put it in a readme file

00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,969
what exactly do you do with it

00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,279
many people are not aware of what the

00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:33,560
the best thing to do here is and it's

00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,259
also not immediately apparent what the

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,949
best thing to do here the next problem

00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:42,169
that people come across is what they

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,899
should do if they have multiple licenses

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,509
in their project so let's take an

00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:50,149
example let's say that you've decided to

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:55,039
place your code or your software project

00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:56,659
under the GPL three license but now you

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,349
also have some documentation that's

00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:02,599
licensed under say a Creative Commons

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:04,969
license so now in your project there are

00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,490
two licenses so how should you convey

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:10,789
this information in your repo should you

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,759
now have two license files yes so the

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:16,550
next problem how can you make sure that

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,770
people who intend to reuse your code are

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:24,030
aware of the license that you have

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:26,010
chosen so if we take another example

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,190
say that you have used a copyleft

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:33,450
license to cover your code again let's

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:36,360
say this is the the GPL realizin this

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,520
puts some obligation some obligations on

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,000
a person who is reusing your code

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,030
because the idea of copyleft if if we

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
put it very simply and very hastily the

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,810
idea of copyleft is that someone who

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,660
releases a modified version of your work

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,840
has to ensure that this modified work

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,760
has the same rights preserved and so

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,520
it's important that the person reusing

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,290
your software has the information that

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
your software is licensed under a

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,360
copyleft license so that they are

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,010
informed about your choice so that they

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,740
know that they have to release a

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:14,220
modified version of your work under the

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,670
same terms that you've chosen and the

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,440
last point I have on my slide here is

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,170
which license does an external resource

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,170
have an external resource that you're

00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:28,380
using and who has its copyright who owns

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,990
its copyright so being able to reuse

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,130
code freely is great because we do not

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,650
have to try to solve every problem

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,190
ourselves we're able to build upon

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:40,800
solutions that others have already found

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,300
this cooperation is in the lifeblood of

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,240
free software I guess it forms the

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,060
backbone of free software so to speak so

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,070
if you're facing a problem and you found

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,120
out that another developer has already

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,830
written code to solve this issue yeah

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,080
it's a it's a no brainer that you would

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,260
want to reuse this code solution in your

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,960
own program and free software enables

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,150
you to do this but now in order to do

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,980
this properly you need to find out what

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,230
license the other developer has chosen

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,030
you need to find out the terms have been

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:17,610
selected for their code that you now

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:20,190
want to use in your own program so the

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,890
reducer in the rears initiative came

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,300
about because we the fsfe looked at

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,630
these problems that developers are

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,880
facing and it's clear that there needs

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,140
to be a way to make this all easier for

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,940
everyone so reuse is basically

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,839
initiative and initiative to help you

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,629
breeze off where developers

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,410
the idea behind it is to solve the

00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:48,129
problem of messy or inadequate software

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,319
licensing at the very source so this

00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:53,309
means that instead of storing copyright

00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:55,809
and licensing information somewhere else

00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:57,730
we want to store this information as

00:08:55,809 --> 00:09:01,959
close as possible to the source file

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:04,870
themselves if this is the case then it

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,870
would be really difficult for someone or

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,040
a developer who wants to reuse your code

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,980
it would be very difficult for them to

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,029
ignore your licensing choices and your

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,889
copyright information now when we say

00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,639
storing this information close to the

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:24,939
source ideally this means storing the

00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,290
information in every file practically

00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,850
this means that in every source code

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,999
file you have your repo you would have

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,740
something like a common header with all

00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:35,439
the practical information about your

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,300
license and copyright information that

00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:40,620
you need to display so this makes it

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,620
very easy to find this information

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,320
so to achieve this yeah you can

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,770
accomplish this in the following three

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,710
simple steps first you choose and you

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:56,440
provide your license you make a

00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,300
conscious decision about which license

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,390
you want to have to apply to your

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:05,320
program and store the full license text

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,690
inside your repo the second step is to

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,290
add your copyright and licensing

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,970
information to every file usually that

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,310
would mean that you add a common header

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,410
to every source code file containing the

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,630
relevant copyright and licensing

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,920
information so files where this is not

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:27,130
possible for example image files or

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,070
binary files there are alternatives to

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,170
do this that we have in our reuse

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,420
specifications and our rears epic use

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,600
that you can look into but the

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,520
underlying idea is the same it's to

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,770
provide information for these files as

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,830
close to the source as possible and as

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:48,370
transparently as possible and the last

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:51,370
step is to confirm reuse compliance now

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,490
this is made simple with a reuse helper

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,740
tool that we have available that the

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,410
tool can help to check your repository

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:05,560
and to verify whether you have the

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:08,380
information available for every file now

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,020
so right now I want to talk a little bit

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,060
about the second step that I mentioned

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,660
which is adding copyright and licensing

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,780
information so as I mentioned earlier

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,910
under the reuse initiative we recommend

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,250
adding a comment header containing the

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,850
relevant copyright and licensing

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,490
information to every source code file so

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,260
many of you might be asking what does a

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,810
comment header with this information

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,710
look like that and how you should

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:42,010
display this so on my slide here we have

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,020
a we have an example of a comment header

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,410
which you can place in the top of your

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,300
file of every file this is an example of

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,000
a good license notice and copyright

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,560
statement so from this we can see the

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,820
relevant information that you need to

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,470
provide

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:02,260
first is your license information so if

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,050
you take a look at it using using an SPD

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,460
X licensed identifier is a very good way

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:13,360
to to unambiguously communicate the

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,920
license of your code or the code or the

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,350
license that covers the code of this

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,950
particular source file so you can get

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:23,170
this easily from the SPD X website they

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,170
have an extensive database of the

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,690
licenses and the light and their

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,010
corresponding license identifiers so

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,430
just pick the one for the license that

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:36,130
you've chosen and include include the

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,920
identifiers in your commentator in the

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,180
example here again chosen the identifier

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:46,260
for the GPL 3 so the SPD X license

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,730
identifier would be GPL 3.0 or later and

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:53,230
then you mark it or tag it with the

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,540
phrase SPD X Alexis identifier the next

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,140
thing you want to do is to display your

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,200
copyright information so this informs

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,910
you of who the copyright holder is now

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,000
why do we need to display this

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,960
information so copyright statements like

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,380
the one that's shown they're not always

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,990
required by law but in practice it's

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,240
it's always very useful as proof or an

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,360
indicator at least of what the copyright

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,550
situation of that work is I mean

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,560
additionally most licenses will also

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,940
explicitly call for you to do this any

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,690
way to include copyright statement yeah

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,860
on a more practical side of things if

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,520
you look at it from more practical

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,160
aspect this also allows for easy

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,870
traceability of the code sometimes you

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,640
or others who are studying your program

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,340
you might want to reach out to the

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,390
original author of the code for for

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:56,140
legal or technical reasons and so yeah

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,610
this information makes it easy so a good

00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,050
company

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,779
statement should consist of the

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,820
following information start off with the

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:06,750
copyright sign to see with a circle

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,149
around it yeah and then the year of the

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,120
first publication of the copyrighted

00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:15,000
text this would be the year in which you

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,209
created the file and have not modified

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,550
it since then you include the name of

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:24,120
the copyright holder typically this

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,040
would mean the author but it can also be

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,570
your employer depending on the kind of

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,329
agreements that you may have in place

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,310
about who owns copyright of the book so

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,740
for example if you have it in your

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,120
employment contract that anything you

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,279
produce in the course of your employment

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,430
the copyright then you lost your

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,410
employer then yeah the your employer is

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,910
the copyright holder and this is an

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,760
important bit of information that you

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:52,050
need to that you need to tell others

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,740
about and finally a valid contact to the

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,470
copyright owner now a contact is not

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,540
required by copyright law but as

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,269
mentioned before it's extremely useful

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,310
for practical reason so maybe someone

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,070
needs to ask the author how the code

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,329
works you might have a fix for the

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,579
author that you might want to send to

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:14,940
them yeah so basically questions or a

00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,140
feedback yeah there are many different

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,410
reasons for needing to contact the

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,449
author much of communication on the

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,720
interest on the internet today still

00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:26,519
hinges on email so the copyright holders

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,360
email address should be the first option

00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,820
to go to here however as long as the

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,160
contact is easily accessible and in use

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,720
for the long term another form of

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,029
contact information here will also be

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,699
valid but email it's generally the best

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:45,930
option yeah whatever you feel most

00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:49,769
comfortable with also works yes so

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:52,079
storing this information makes sense if

00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,390
there's ever a need to find the original

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,329
upstream of a particular file in your

00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:00,180
codebase and there are no names there

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:03,360
are no links licenses etc you know in it

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:07,250
then it becomes a huge pain and can get

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,680
very costly and yeah the saying is

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,260
prevention is better than cure that's

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,540
that's very relevant today in the

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,210
current health situation but it's also

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,610
relevant for free software it's it's

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,860
much better to put in a little bit of

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:25,490
effort upfront to keep things

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:29,570
transparent and accountable and most

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,640
importantly orderly yeah it's it's much

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,910
better to do all this stuff now then you

00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:40,580
have to do some serious digging later on

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:44,300
when the need for it arises so to help

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:48,010
you apply these best practices we've

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:51,320
developed several components of reuse

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:55,340
yeah so we have a helper to a helper

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,550
helper tool that you can run to see and

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,160
to check if your reuse compliant not

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,990
only that the helper tool can also help

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,750
you to download the full text of the

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:09,560
licence you need so you don't have to go

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,689
around digging in the internet or it

00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,430
also helps you to add copyright and

00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,010
licensing information to your file

00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:19,970
hitter's and contains a linter tool to

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,620
help you identify problems of course we

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,890
also work on the educational side of

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,470
things so we have a tutorial that helps

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:32,690
you understand the how and why of reuse

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:34,580
so our materials basically help you help

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,580
guide you through an example repository

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,710
and from there you can learn how to make

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,950
a repo reuse compliant while

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,440
understanding the principles of reuse we

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,930
also have an FAQ that's not just for

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,230
reuse and the reuse principles but also

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,870
for basic licensing questions so if you

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,990
ever have a need feel like you want to

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,240
understand more about software illegal

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,090
licensing then you know the epic use

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,340
would help you out there another

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,830
component we have is the best practices

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,950
that we've developed these are available

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,320
as formal specifications to make to try

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,720
to make reuse a standard so that all

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,690
free software projects can apply and

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,860
follow reuse yeah regardless of the size

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,730
of the free software project

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,970
and last but not least we also have a

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,280
reuse API and with this you can quickly

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,900
register your project so it's and you

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,220
get repository whether it's on github

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:38,040
get lab or an independent get platform

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,990
you can see if it is reuse compliant if

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,480
it is it will generate a dynamic batch

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,640
that you can include in your readme file

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:51,440
so people can know that your users can

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:54,540
find so who is already using reuse then

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,630
of course the FSM phase repos are all

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,179
views compliant but we've also had some

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,429
multinationals that are already making

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,350
use of reuse they're setting it as the

00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:07,770
best practice for their developers and

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:11,460
for their projects we also have the

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:14,910
Linux kernel which is right now 60 to 70

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,580
percent reuse compliant already so real

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,260
Linux has added the license and

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,480
copyright information as headers already

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,210
- about 60 to 70 percent of their files

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,510
and also one of the things that we're

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,860
quite happy with is that we've also

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,900
introduced reuse to a large number of

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,679
free software projects funded by the

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,360
European Commission these projects are

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:43,169
funded as part of the next generation

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:45,630
internet or the NGI initiative so yeah

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:46,440
if if I could just go off a little bit

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,390
on a tangent here

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,440
I'll talk quickly about the next

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:54,059
generation Internet initiative so yeah

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,190
this is an Internet this is an

00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,520
initiative launched by the European

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,309
Commission it aims to shape what the

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,929
internet will be in the coming years

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,299
basically what it hopes to achieve is to

00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,820
ensure that the internet must be a

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,669
platform that embodies values that we

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,440
hold dear and free in that we hold dear

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,440
in a free and open society yeah

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:22,150
so these values that we're talking about

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,890
our values like openness inclusivity

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:28,130
transparency privacy cooperation

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,260
security and yeah protection of data the

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,270
idea is that with these values in place

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,390
the Internet can be a platform that

00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:38,000
supports human rights democracy and a

00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:41,180
more progressive and enlightened society

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,280
and I think these are very inspirational

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:49,910
goals indeed so how does the NGI

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,370
initiative intend to do this what it

00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,590
does is to provide financial and

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,360
technical assistance to individual

00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,730
researchers and developers who are

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,680
working on new technologies or software

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,560
projects that have the potential to

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,960
contribute to to the values that I

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,770
previously mentioned to these values of

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,560
the of this new Internet at the end of

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:16,420
the involvement with ngi the software

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,420
will be made available as free software

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,240
so there are currently two actions in

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,670
ngi that the fsfe is involved in

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,300
nickname and gi0 pet and angeas or

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:32,120
discovery so the pet project it assists

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,390
projects that are developing privacy and

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,220
trusts enhancing technologies and for

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,520
the search and discovery project it

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,650
assists software's that enhance user

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,270
access to search for and discover

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:47,240
information on the Internet

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,550
so it's it's about software that helps

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,130
of consolidating databases improving

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,890
search engine capabilities stuff like

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:59,540
that so how does this work for a

00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:02,120
developer or free software them so what

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,600
happens is if you're a developer of a

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,960
new piece of software and you feel that

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,450
your your project your software fits

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,040
into the requirements of the pet or

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,980
discovery programs if you feel that it

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:19,700
upholds these values and can improve the

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,350
Internet in a way that improves the

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,050
respect of these values that previously

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,210
mentioned then you can apply to join the

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,040
program every two months

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,539
the programs will evaluate the

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,399
applications and

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,889
a new batch of approved software

00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:37,100
projects if your project is accepted

00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:38,869
then you qualify to receive funding as

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,049
well as assistance from the NGO zero

00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:46,309
consortium so it's a it's basically a

00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:50,090
consortium of a bunch of NGOs of which

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:51,979
the fsfe is one of the members and yeah

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,479
other partners we have index in this

00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:56,509
consortium assist with things like

00:22:53,479 --> 00:23:02,299
accessibility security language

00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:04,340
translations things like that yeah so

00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,529
what is our role and what do we assist

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,789
them with so for the fsfe our

00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:10,239
involvement is basically to provide

00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:12,559
assistance with free software licensing

00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:16,609
in particular we want to make sure that

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:19,450
all the successful applicants have that

00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:22,249
their license information is accurate

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,830
that their licenses are compatible with

00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:27,139
one another and that they're presented

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,330
in a manner that is in accordance with

00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:33,039
the best practices as established by our

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,869
reuse initiative so reuse compliance

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,190
yeah so if you're working on a project

00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:42,710
that fits this criteria please do apply

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:45,710
yeah or if you know of any developers

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,149
who are working on a software that fits

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,599
the profiles of one of these programs

00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:51,799
please do encourage them to apply if you

00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,330
know if anyone who fits the bill help

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,070
spread the word about this opportunity

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,099
for funding and assistance and encourage

00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,710
them to apply as well I've just noticed

00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:04,489
that I have not included the website

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:07,399
here I do apologize for that if you're

00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:10,639
interested please I do have my email at

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:12,919
the end of this presentation please feel

free to email me directly to get more

00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,529
information about how you can apply for

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:21,169
this for this program yeah so yes let's

00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:28,340
get back off from that tangent back onto

00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:32,179
reuse so yeah reuse is free software

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:35,749
naturally and as such you know you can

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,999
look you can inspect it you can try to

00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:40,220
improve on it we look forward to your

00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:43,460
bug reports and your pull requests if

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,710
you try it out you can also give us the

00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,950
back on our specifications and our epic

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:53,149
use so yeah please help us to become

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,429
better and to help to help it become

00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:58,460
easier for everyone to properly do their

00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,830
free software licensing and yeah help us

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,630
to spread the word if you like it tell

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,840
your friends tell your co-workers tell

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,730
employers yeah reuse get stronger the

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,760
more people adopt it

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:13,789
yeah and and the more people adopted the

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,299
easier it is the simpler it is or a

00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:22,100
copyright and licensing to for everyone

00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:24,080
yeah so yes that is my presentation if

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,779
you have any questions please feel free

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,770
to contact me directly here or contact

00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:34,460
us at its general yeah thank you very

00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:38,960
much yeah Thank You Gabriel can you hear

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,880
me yes I can hear you lovely okay so I

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,809
have a couple of questions here are you

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,600
ready yes okay so the first one is there

00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:50,409
are lots of compliance tools out there

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,000
it's like scan code for Salah do RT

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:55,730
doing different parts of the compliance

00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:07,549
job where on the compliance tool map is

00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:10,850
reuse yeah so I guess I would say reuse

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,470
isn't trying to completely replace all

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,710
these other scanning tools

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,320
now what Rios is trying to do is just to

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,669
make sure that the information is

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,190
displayed in a in a manner that is

00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:29,090
accessible to everybody so it's trying

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:31,309
to to simplify how you should properly

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:35,059
display your your licensing information

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:40,610
and to put it in a manner that it's easy

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:43,070
for everyone to understand so it's not

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,730
so much a scanning tool in enough in

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,830
itself

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,480
it's more a set of best practices that

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,940
you should apply in order to make

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,580
everything else easier for everyone else

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,710
so we do have a helper tool that helps

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:58,070
with making sure that you apply these

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,580
best practices but the tool itself

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,110
it's just a way to facilitate the best

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,870
practices that we're that we're talking

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:13,460
about so I I hope that answers the

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:16,100
question I hope so yeah okay can I add

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,880
two licenses to my projects or stone

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,790
using reuse I figure it's about dual

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:27,170
licensing a project yes yes you can

00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:30,050
absolutely because the idea is that in

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,450
your repo when you apply the reuse best

00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:34,280
practices then you have all your

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:38,660
licensing information conveniently

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:42,290
available in your repo so if you have

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:44,750
multiple licenses then as mentioned

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:48,860
before the licensing information is

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:51,320
supposed to go directly as close as

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,770
possible to the source so what happens

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,810
then is if you have certain aspects

00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:01,210
different parts of your repo that are

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,210
licensed under different licenses then

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:10,340
the licensing information for separate

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:13,850
files might be different and that yeah

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:20,680
so it the idea is to make sure that each

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:22,640
individual file has its own license

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,430
commentator's with the licensing

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,960
information so if you have multiple

00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:32,030
licenses in your in your repo then that

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,220
is possible it's just that it's

00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:39,740
displayed in a manner where people know

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:42,890
exactly which aspects or which segments

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:48,230
of your of your project are licensed

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:50,570
under different licenses okay how do you

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,330
recommend adding years to knock the

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:56,060
latest copyright period coma or so comma

00:28:53,330 --> 00:29:01,810
separator or using a range and does

00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:05,000
reuse support this generally I would say

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:10,220
the idea of having multiple years in

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,809
your copyright information is it's a con

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:18,770
practice but to make things easier the

00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:21,919
the year in which the the last change

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:26,270
was made would be the one that we would

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:30,169
recommend you to do III think that it

00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:32,419
supports having multiple years but of

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:34,610
course that complicates things for for

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:39,320
someone who's reusing the information

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:42,740
and as mentioned before the year in

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,150
which you stopped modifying the file and

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,210
the year in which you have the most

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,640
up-to-date version out there that should

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,200
be the one that you know you put in your

00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:57,690
copyright information

00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:00,840
okay so marketing probably done by

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:04,049
proprietary compliance to providers or

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:08,119
service companies focus on risks of

00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:10,230
using force rather than the benefits so

00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:13,549
probably with that in mind have you

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:19,289
gotten any negative feedback from anyone

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:25,470
um not so much I mean I I think reuse

00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:27,840
hasn't really been as widespread as we

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,309
would like it to be so a lot of our

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,679
adopters and a lot of the feedback that

00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:38,909
we get at the moment are from people who

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:42,119
are already predisposed or inclined to

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:42,960
be using free software which is why yeah

00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,299
which is why at the end of my

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,859
presentation I sort of asked you to help

00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,619
spread the word because we would like

00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:52,710
this to become a bigger deal a bigger

00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:54,299
standard than it is yeah we haven't

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:59,159
really heard that much from any

00:30:54,299 --> 00:31:02,249
proprietary doctors but generally the

00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,889
feedback that we have received from from

00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:06,590
those who are already you know inclined

00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:10,289
to use free software has been positive

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,299
so I I'm sorry I don't have much more

00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:15,179
for you on that one

00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:18,269
okay copyright and license can earth

00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:22,259
takes forever how quick is reuse in

00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:28,220
doing its job it really depends on the

00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:32,730
size of your repo so we we've had scans

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:36,080
so we've had we've run scans on repos

00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:40,169
that have thousands of files before and

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:43,169
that takes upwards of an hour or so but

00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:50,639
at the same time you know it it also

00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:54,960
really depends on how how well the the

00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:56,730
repo is licensed because and if every

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,480
file has its comment headers sort of

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:03,629
there it it sort of generates and scans

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,490
quite quickly I would think yeah and it

00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:10,770
depends on the size of your reform

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:13,350
repository really okay so it first one

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:17,000
note here is that I'm using both

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:19,440
facility and and scam co in my work and

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,160
it takes quite a long time and I'm not

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,760
saying that it depends on the quality of

00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:30,780
neither of the tools but reuse is doing

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,970
quite a bit less than both can code em

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,429
for solidarity so it must be quicker I

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,559
figure yeah yeah it is much quicker I

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:40,140
mean maybe maybe I shouldn't have

00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,110
brought up the repose of thousands of

00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:46,230
files so on a standard repo that we've

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,900
been scanning five minutes three minutes

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,880
it's a matter of minutes

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:57,080
it won't take up the better part of your

00:32:50,880 --> 00:33:01,800
day okay and that's it for the questions

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:04,260
so I'm leaving the mic to you are yeah

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,550
and I would just like to say a big thank

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,550
you to to Gabriel

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,169
