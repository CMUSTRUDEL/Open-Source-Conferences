Description: 
	Hours before an important customer demo, one hundred streetlights are running a pre-release software version with a critical bug that prevents them from working properly. What's worse, the bug also causes the remote-update mechanism to fail. Fortunately, a recent update had introduced an off-by-one bug that allowed us to create a stack smash attack that could inject a patch into each light and fix the lamps just in time before sunrise.
