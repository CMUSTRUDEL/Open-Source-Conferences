okay can you hear me yes right thank you

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,910
for coming

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,250
yeah Chris Chris is a great speaker and

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,460
a great teacher so it's gonna be hard to

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,460
beat

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:36,780
okay so let's talk a little bit about

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,850
open source and agility so my name is I

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,739
was team I need to attend good I'm from

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,980
Spain I've basically been a somehow a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:52,760
manager all my life the last few years a

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,080
consultant but or an entrepreneur or so

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,570
and most of my career has been

00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,210
indirectly in open source either working

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,140
in the open directly managing teams

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,700
working in the open or somehow halfway

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,350
through the open and R&D or production

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,590
[Music]

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:16,710
I'm also has contributed to several

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,470
projects probably the one that I have

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,259
contributed the most has been KD since

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,570
the early 2000s I were now as a

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,539
consultant for cold thinking it's a

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,520
bearish company although it has

00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:34,799
customers worldwide we are close to a

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,009
hundred people and basically what

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,619
coughing does is engineering services

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,810
and consultancy mostly very focused or

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,810
embedded how to produce software best

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:50,700
practices and we are also an open source

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,340
company we like to think that we are an

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,429
open source company was funded by by

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,079
open source developers and we we do a

00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,140
lot of open source and we bring open

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,929
source into customers and the way the

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,670
open source way into customers and well

00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:07,710
they are here on the slides a few

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,590
projects that we lead we contribute to

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,340
many from the kernel to system v2

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,190
desktops mini and we lead a few somehow

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,190
I put there some bill strain is a build

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,590
tool well it's an integration to not a

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,560
bit to then build grid is all about

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,420
remote execution you know sending jobs

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,460
to different data centers so the builds

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,540
get ready

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:35,030
use immensely in the build times these

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,310
kind of things and well forget to basic

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,380
a trust of all and we have we have

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,610
others okay so so the idea is that I'm

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,560
gonna talk a little bit they're gonna

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,250
make a first and intro and then I gonna

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,960
go through values principles

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:56,510
methodologies and skills as a way to

00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:01,040
just by providing personal experiences

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:03,530
or my personal point of view tell you

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:10,220
why I think that open source is a great

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:11,960
way to shorten the the path for any

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,070
organization that is trying to move

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:22,040
towards becoming I hate the word agile

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:25,970
and towards agility okay so the first

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:29,660
thing is yeah every time you I start in

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,090
any consultancy work or any talk and

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,320
it's something about even close to what

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,290
aside you're the first thing you need to

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,690
do is define right so you like to talk

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,780
about agility to avoid that al-kaldiya

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:45,200
bran or can be the manifesto you can

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,080
refer to different things so I like to

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,830
talk about agility to about to avoid a

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,960
misuse of the term and also I like this

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,740
idea of always talking about journey

00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,800
always towards agility as a way to refer

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,740
to to this as a process right as a

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,680
journey to many people is focused

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,100
completely on methodologies and that is

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,570
to meet two static right so I like to

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,580
refer more to the principles and the

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,410
values and techniques that can help you

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:21,790
to get there so the first idea is that a

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:27,710
jille methods were defining I'm decided

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:32,510
few years back as team level still level

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:34,580
techniques or methodologies and yeah it

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,140
seems companies or many organizations

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,840
specially bigger annotations are defined

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,330
and designer as structure esteem in

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,300
teams it works very well when you try to

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,080
scale them up

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,150
horizontally and then optimize at a team

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,569
level but as any local optimization when

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,150
you're trying to roll them up then is

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:57,150
when you start to see how the

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,030
limitations riding I study physics and

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,860
this is a very well-known problem in

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,650
physics right when you're modeling to

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:09,539
optimize for local systems and you try

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,970
to scale up the system it doesn't work

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,300
very well so from the modeling

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,520
perspective this is very common at least

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,530
from my personal point of view I put

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,050
there a link to a very well-known talk

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:28,550
for our very well-known agile East that

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:34,560
points in that direction so scaling up

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:37,530
agile methods do not take you to as an

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,210
organization to become agile or do not

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,919
take you very far when it comes to big

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,620
yeah going through that journey I mean

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,000
it's a necessary step but it's it's not

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,889
the only step if we focus on on a little

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,039
bit on open source open source focus

00:05:52,889 --> 00:06:00,779
more on on communities and in practices

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:03,240
and that provides a lot of adaptability

00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,509
so that's that's one of the

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,150
characteristics of of open source and

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:13,139
the second one is that when you when you

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,560
look back since the the 80s right when

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,629
with BSD and and then with all the work

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,870
done by the Free Software Foundation and

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:24,330
later on Linux and and and you see how

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,919
open source is today you know there are

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,129
quite a few projects that have scale up

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,740
a lot right so scalability is a

00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:34,879
characteristic that open source under

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:40,319
certain circumstances might seem to have

00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:44,310
so when when approaching an organization

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,199
that is trying to add scale move towards

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,690
agility one of the things are coming

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,180
from open source I say look I what are

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,520
the things that I have that I know or

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,159
that open source have an old that can

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,039
help in these circumstances or if you

00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:01,440
are leading teams four or five scrum

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,960
teams and you want to scale up the

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,639
agility process up to this the following

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,580
level right to product definition of

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,680
portfolio definition better how do I do

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,029
that right what can I take from open

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,949
source that helps me so let's see I want

00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,520
to tell you a few examples that in my

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:22,830
opinion there are so many that it's

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,009
impossible to properly in a day but at

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,690
least I will give you two or three tips

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:33,050
so so but basically a lot of what I do

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:36,440
is take those examples giving them some

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:40,589
science or engineering back up and then

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,409
out of that move into into practices

00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:47,250
that you can take to your organization

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:49,770
so let's start by the values in science

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,149
it's a gonna be very quick so if we look

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,479
at the values and I have to summarize

00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:56,219
the manifesto into concept simple

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,610
concepts write to me would be something

00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:01,759
like teen trust collaboration and

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,529
flexibility

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,560
trust and collaboration a lot of people

00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,819
refer to it as transparency well it's

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,319
not the same but definitely they are

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,149
heavily related now when I think about

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,459
when I try to think about those concepts

00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,500
apply to open source I come up with

00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,680
different ones different values so the

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,940
first one is consensus it's all about

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,620
transparency I think that open source

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,719
take the collaboration concept

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,860
significantly farther is more about

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,270
co-creation not just collaboration and

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,669
freedom is essential right it's not

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,740
about being only flexible is a lot about

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,099
freedom so I will focus a little bit on

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:47,120
transparency and yeah because it's

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,279
related to trust and collaboration so

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,199
back in my early days I I started in

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,790
open source again I'm not a developer

00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,339
right I started up a source with my own

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,750
little company I rediscovered open

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,390
source and I thought you know what I

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,069
gonna turn my IT training company into a

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,120
software development company and we're

00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:05,279
gonna do it with open source because

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,529
it's whatever I don't remember what I

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,790
thought back then I just remember that I

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:13,200
wanted to go that way

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,910
and I remember back then starting to

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,860
collaborate with some upstream projects

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,020
and also with other companies back there

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,310
in the Canary Islands and collaborating

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,040
with other companies would form a group

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,330
so we were 40 people distributed among

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,940
the four companies distributed in

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,610
different islands right so it was very

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,430
natural for me to adopt this concept of

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,560
mailing list right mailing list back

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,060
then it was revolutionary for me I come

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,080
from the traditional management part

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,820
right I did physics but it was a yeah

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,250
old-fashioned sure so this mainly thing

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,510
it was for me kind of scary really a

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,090
mailing list transparent to all

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,950
employees really that will create a lot

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,300
of noise I remember perfectly thinking

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,700
about that and discussing and the other

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,200
guys were were truly open-source

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
entrepreneurs so it was like no look

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,530
this is no brainer so either you go

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,750
through this or not so I had an option I

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,940
went through it and it turned out to be

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,050
absolutely awesome right having an ax

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,910
synchronous channel where everybody can

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,510
put their some deep thoughts that you

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,670
think about it lien and express their

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,660
and where it doesn't matter what is your

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,670
title it's all about your ideas right

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,760
that that that was very powerful then

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,610
obviously I went into global open source

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,430
projects and I moved to significantly

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,340
bigger open source companies and and now

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,650
as a consult and I I keep thinking that

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,790
is a tremendously powerful tool because

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,620
it's all transparency at at full so I've

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:45,840
been in companies working companies in

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,670
which the CEO is hardly beaten by a new

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,700
being Ginny hearing something

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,350
I mean it's that's really cool for also

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,660
for the CEO maybe at the beginning he

00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:00,660
doesn't feel like it but it is so

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,790
whenever I go to a place and know we're

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,980
trying to become agile help transparent

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,760
you are a and when when I see how they

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,740
think about the this lack channel so

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,810
they especially a synchronous channels

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,430
the mainland Lisa Cole I okay you have a

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,400
long way to go in open source we have

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,860
that as a given right so taking that

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,200
that we have when it comes to

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,540
transparency these these are

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,170
or whatever other it's a very very

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,000
powerful thing so it really helps when

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,480
when you think about big transformation

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,980
processes of entire organizations there

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,140
are tons of other examples in which

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,580
little things that we do that we take as

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,290
a given in open source that are

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,080
absolutely revolutionary when you take

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,600
them at scale in organizations when it

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,640
comes to transparency so if we go to the

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,220
principal's right you can go to the 12

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,930
principles and I pick one because it

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,900
affects me directly then you know the

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:58,350
principle number five hits directly to

00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,690
the way we understand management people

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,930
management but also pro yet or product

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,480
management right and there is a big

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:09,540
shift that a manager have to go through

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,850
when when when it does open source when

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,710
when it's about open source in most

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,560
cases you need to have one leg in your

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,690
organization that has certain structures

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,510
and their culture and then one had one

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,680
food on your one foot on on your open

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,140
source project that has a different

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,430
culture different structure so you need

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,560
to find a way in which you feel

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,380
comfortable in both no you cannot switch

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,750
we we are not that good right so instead

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,340
of acting differently when you are

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,560
inside and outside you have to find a

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:42,270
way to act the same and there are two

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,000
two elements that I yeah I recommend two

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,460
to go through and every time I go to a

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,400
new company and I have younger managers

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:55,590
I try to explain them very early and

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:58,800
it's that when we think about agile at

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,650
scale we have this idea of stop focusing

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,600
on people start focusing on the work

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:08,580
right so when you take that to open

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,580
source in open source it's an

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,720
environment in which autonomy is a given

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,130
there is no way you can control what

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,610
people does no matter if you have them

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:19,050
sit here right it's all about let them

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,330
do their thing right there are the

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,920
executors engineers are they secure so

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,740
they take the power it's it's all about

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,390
giving power back to those who do stuff

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,040
so you have when you are a first first

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,290
level management or product management

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,060
product project manager engineer manager

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,430
you have to go through this process

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:42,240
of stop focusing on performance and

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:45,150
productivity and and and and start to

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,250
focus on where the real risks are and

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,260
the risk in open source our focus

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,880
completely on alignment and its

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,920
alignment what you have to worry about

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,650
in an organization usually a diamond is

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,320
a job of senior managers vision mission

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,330
that's what executive does but but

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,740
alignment is about senior management so

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,950
you have to go through this learning

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,740
process to move away from performance

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,990
from productivity from deadlines and

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,670
move to a little bit more into alignment

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,560
it's a process that everybody has to go

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,290
through now when you think about iolite

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,380
scale that is a process that you also

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,150
have to go through it's not so dramatic

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,190
but you have to also do a little bit of

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,830
that right stop focusing on people start

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,280
focusing on work and also alignment

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,950
becomes important because engineering

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,840
teams has a lot of more freedom they

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,830
they have a lot of more autonomy which

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,680
is a very good thing just another

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:44,430
example and if we think about the

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,840
methodologies I yea was thinking about

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,660
which one I gonna talk and probably

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,250
gonna talk one in that that it's not so

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,170
obvious when you are in the commercial

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:57,510
world but when you are in open-source is

00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:00,090
again a given we have this idea agile

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,320
it's a lot about colocation I mean it

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,330
used to be more than it is today but

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,260
it's a lot about colocation right face

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:11,040
to face interaction and open source is

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,960
is global it's about being global so you

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,670
cannot assume face to face interaction

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,440
it's all about how we interact with each

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,530
other and be efficient or in a

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,840
synchronous environment right in which

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,520
not necessarily you are together I mean

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,260
you don't need you cannot take as a

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,940
given to be in the same time zone right

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:31,650
and as a the agile movement goes into

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,930
bigger and bigger companies that have

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:37,230
become more and more popular you know

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:40,140
you have these huge struggles on how to

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,440
apply agile methodologies beyond your

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,110
site right at a team level that's fine

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,210
but think about these production

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,470
environments in which you have this this

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,780
company that has a very

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,310
complex production pipeline because you

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,350
know the environment it's complete they

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,650
are trying to reduce it but they have a

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,140
functional they have a structure in

00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:04,470
which they have functional separation

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,300
that also has involved geographic

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,010
separation so you have the testers in

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,380
one slide you have the integrators in

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,660
another one you have the guys in charge

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,660
of the deployments in another one or you

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,840
have Trend mirror teams right so to

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,300
cover different deals so start to get

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,490
very complicated and and in days they

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,770
really struggle on how to apply

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,930
methodologies there are focus on teams

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:33,570
that are co-located and and they are

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:35,550
end-to-end teams right so as a person

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,470
that comes from open source you go like

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,150
well you know we are global so let's see

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,450
what we can take and there are tons of

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:44,700
things that we take as a given that

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,600
really really really help right so for

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:51,390
instance I've been more than wise and

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,310
once in this situation in which I am in

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,870
control of the production pipeline and I

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,820
start to go okay you know let's let's

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,710
try to increase the working hours you

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,900
know your lead times are significantly

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,250
bigger than your working hours and you

00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,190
have a problem because the feedback

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,230
loops are too big too long sorry and

00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,480
then you have to add the functional

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,700
separation then and you come from open

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,200
source and several things you take as a

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,480
given in an open source project the

00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,550
specialization is significantly lower

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,500
than in a corporate environment so you

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,550
have this concept of t-shaped people

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,720
t-shaped people and much more by hard

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,410
you have to put your hands in different

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,600
places and that's okay and and also you

00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,820
know this idea that in that we

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,190
manufacture brings into into software

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,930
development into oil off you have to be

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,150
a specialist in your stage but you also

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:42,120
have to learn and know a little bit

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,530
about your adjacent stages because you

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,100
know sometimes when you don't have any

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,420
other choice they don't your only way of

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,060
reducing bottlenecks might be to

00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,520
increase capacity urgently you know if

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,400
you if you go to some queue queueing

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,940
theory that's that's that's exactly the

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,530
kind of problems they try to solve so

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,890
coming from open source you don't have

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,230
to

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,000
that you don't have to change people's

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,590
mindset you don't have to restructure

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,570
and people that come from Prince Olav

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,730
has that as a given so the

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,350
infrastructure is transparent right I

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,280
can put my hands in different places

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,560
he's expected right and and working with

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,130
ten time zones is also expected I

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:28,020
remember the kd4 days when I was I had

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,510
my laptop with me Anna amd64 it was very

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,840
very new back then right and so I was

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:38,040
basically testing the the what other my

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,160
colleagues were doing so I had this CD

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,250
burner and and my laptop and every

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,950
morning I got into work and as a side

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,500
project I simply had the the image to

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,720
download and a spreadsheet with some

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,250
manual testing that I could do and then

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,260
report right and I remember my shock by

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,440
seeing that every single morning I had

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,480
my my image available because somebody

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,910
in the u.s. just took care of that and

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,490
then the people that were trying all my

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,440
my my problems were basically in the

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,260
other side of the world so I remember

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,030
getting I mean I was I was in the Canary

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,470
Islands and we have one hour different

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,450
with the mainland we had customers there

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,120
and we increase the shift by you know

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,380
staying a little longer and and we did

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,410
all that everybody does that but you

00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,770
know doing this at scale globally it's

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:30,150
it's it's you get it in and and when you

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,060
go to the corporation you see well we

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,700
have the testers in India as I would why

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,820
do you have anybody in Colombia or in

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,620
Venezuela or Mexico no why you know it's

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:48,020
you're gonna prove your lead-time

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:48,020
significantly just by doing that okay

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,440
yeah when I was thinking about skills or

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,410
competencies you know there are also

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,690
tons of things you can pick up that

00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,490
young kids at the age of 20 that has

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,800
been two or three four years involved in

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,080
open source they have and when you go to

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,710
corporations that are that has been even

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,660
and one or two years already into these

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,820
transformation processes and you talk to

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,890
the developers they're even the younger

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,770
developers who are who has less bias

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,670
right on how the company were they

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:23,110
have and and that helped tremendously in

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:26,600
into this transition towards agility and

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:31,970
when I look at how colleges teach

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:35,060
software engineering to me is I don't

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,220
get it and the whole idea is that you

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,900
you you have imagined five six subjects

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,330
right in your first semester and in the

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,860
five of them you do code for the five of

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,300
them and then the following semester you

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,000
through that go away and you start again

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,830
and and you produce other code and then

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,110
the following year you do the same so by

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,960
the end of the of the your degree you

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,820
have not work on your pass code is

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,670
always new code so you don't have any

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,920
clue about what is nurturing your own

00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,870
code and taking care of it and grow in

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,430
it you have no clue and then you get

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,150
into this company and you start with

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:11,480
somebody else's code and and you know it

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,040
might be only and when you get 30 or 32

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,540
years old depending on the kind of

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,310
companies you get in which you're gonna

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,990
start to maintain your own code and

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:23,780
maybe not even that so when somebody

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,460
comes you know some whoever right yeah

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,410
we have to take ownership of our code

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,240
and people look at you and say well I

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,830
have been taking ownership of my code my

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,140
entire life well you know taking

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,850
ownership of your code it's a little

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,410
more than just producing the code and

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,870
having your name in the alpha write in

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,140
the headers when when you see these kids

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:47,780
with 20 years old or 22 right and and

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,200
they are absolutely exposed when they do

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:53,150
open source absolutely expose and in

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,100
some cases they are producing code that

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:58,940
is that is shaped by the project and

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,410
it's using millions of machines and they

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,180
have the next release so they have to

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,220
take care of their own code right so

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,930
after a couple of years they learn that

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,940
a few things cannot be done it doesn't

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,910
matter how cool they are they cannot be

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,830
done right and so by the time they get

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,300
into your company with 25 and you're

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,250
going through this process somebody

00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,690
comes to tell you know you have to take

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,280
ownership of your code you have to write

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,930
maintainable code I say well I don't

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,510
know if I write mine 10 ml code all I

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,610
can say is that I have written some code

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,620
that it's a medium used by million

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,630
people and I have had to

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,179
fix my own bugs because you know they

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,919
have all these people screaming right so

00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:35,539
I always question why you need to put

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,090
somebody in the customer support on the

00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,279
phone when when you have been in open

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:44,480
source I mean I've seen that done in

00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,860
companies and I still don't get it I'm

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,940
not saying it's bad I'm just saying that

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,000
you have to focus on other people

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:53,179
probably right so there you have another

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,020
example of that in open source you take

00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:59,150
as a given that it you learn that and

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,740
when you go to the company to a company

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,929
and and and they are going through this

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,789
huge transformation that in some cases

00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:09,970
is so painful in some others is so real

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:12,440
it's such a relief

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:16,580
it's a know if one of those things in

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,620
which you know you get there say I might

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,409
not know scrum right I have never done

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,470
scrum I'm 30 and I have never done scrum

00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:26,029
right but I I'm suitable for the job are

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,679
you guys moving yeah we are moving into

00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,260
agile but we are looking for people that

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,299
has done scrum and you go like well you

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,789
know I've been in open-source for 10

00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,590
years so I don't know if I don't know

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,789
then the methodology right it's true I

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,279
haven't worked there it's what a thing

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:42,679
is sometimes by local all what I have

00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,529
right that is so useful in these

00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,720
circumstances right so it's not a 1 or 0

00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:53,210
why this is that open-source trainers in

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,340
transformation processes in big software

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:59,360
or engineering transformation processes

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,730
by working in environments which with

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,820
strong values right that follows

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,510
depending on the con each community has

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,909
different communities have different

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:11,779
principles but they share some and those

00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:15,950
principles work also in in many cases in

00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:19,100
in in agile companies or agile

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:22,580
organizations and then you develop some

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:25,250
you are not very good at strict

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,679
methodologies but you have developed

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,409
tons of practices that are actually very

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,140
very very useful and finally you have

00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:36,220
got you had were certain skills certain

00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,840
competencies that can in my opinion beat

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,630
anybody in any environment right so

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:47,230
that's why in general my

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:51,410
my message always is that open sources

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:54,430
first-class learning ecosystem for a lot

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:58,850
of things and many of those things

00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:00,860
worked beautifully in in organizations

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:04,310
that are trying to become agile that I

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,980
into this huge tsunami that that has

00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,500
come a few years back into in cloud

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,350
companies or in SAS based companies and

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,080
now it's getting more and more into into

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:19,670
embedded which is my mainly focus

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:21,500
nowadays so so yeah so if somebody tells

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,610
you if you are in a job interview and

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:30,710
somebody tells you we do scrum say well

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:40,640
I do open source so what that was my my

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:46,370
take thank you see any question then or

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,500
comment ok let's start here then okay hi

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:52,130
so I wasn't expecting to hear what I

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,220
heard generally and I over all agree

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,380
that definitely the companies should

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,060
look at open source so initially I was

00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,510
expecting that how companies can use

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:04,910
open source components in order to

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,590
remove commodity functionality from the

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:11,090
responsibilities and that will enable

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:14,360
them their business so but but I saw

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:17,240
many generalizations like I think I was

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,050
making notes so you're yeah because I

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:24,920
mean like the key open source key values

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:27,560
like the you were referring mainly this

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,840
was a second or third slide you were

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,440
referring to rather open so open

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,480
organize a organizations

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,610
yeah for example consensus transparency

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,470
I can think of many open-source projects

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:43,490
that are developed behind closed doors

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,500
they don't have these it's Android Open

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,140
Source project many google open source

00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,360
projects they don't have these they are

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,030
very defined they're very I I think

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,000
though down we should try to do I mean

00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:57,910
there is no single way of doing open

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,799
I agree that's why I found many

00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,809
arbitrary generalizations but there is

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,549
definitely one thing that I can say

00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:07,460
about your comment and it's Android is

00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:11,420
not open source yes it is it's MIT

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,429
license or well I think that in order to

00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,830
be open source you need a little bit

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:21,620
more than the license it doesn't matter

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:24,710
what things it's it's open source it's I

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,270
don't think I guess the code is open

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,419
source but it's not an open source

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:33,710
project in any case let me let me refer

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:37,510
to that word IP accuser okay so I put

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:41,540
that word subjective because you know

00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:43,850
these four can be different in and when

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,440
I when I have talked about the

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,070
presentation with others it was a little

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,320
debated transparency should go there if

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:54,200
it's freedom it's a consequence or is

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,830
really a value I mean yet so I decided

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,840
to put subjective there in any case they

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,490
are I mean they could be more but

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,760
definitely in my opinion they are and

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:11,360
yes I said a lot of generalizations but

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:14,260
I stand like them I stand behind them so

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,210
switching subject completely or almost

00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,460
completely you talked about education

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,630
then that you called for a bit and then

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,830
you throw it away in code for a bit and

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,090
throw it away do you have any

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:28,970
suggestions on how to how to improve

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:34,070
education in programming at schools in

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:36,500
universities okay I I was just I I do

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,910
some training and at some point I again

00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:43,540
I had a training company it was my first

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:49,250
my first job which is yeah

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:51,020
and and we were specialized in doing IT

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:55,000
training and now I don't know half of

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:57,860
our work was basically programming and

00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,610
there I got two conclusions from that

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,250
period that that are that the time has

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,350
not ruined completely one of them is

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,960
this when I mentioned about writing my

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,600
maintainable code which has a direct

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,970
impact

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:19,980
costs which that starts and so I would

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:22,110
like to see teachers across software

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,530
engineering studies agreeing that at

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:29,730
least some amount of of subjects will

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:32,130
reduce some amount of code because that

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,419
is not a solve a soft skill set in my

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,880
opinion that is something that the

00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:38,429
company not every company can train so

00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,960
so you you yeah there are many companies

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:42,870
out there that cannot put a young guy to

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,309
learn that it depending on the kind of

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,370
company you have it takes some time

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:50,400
right so I think that it definitely can

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,780
didn't do better and also in the company

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,770
when you focus when you think about

00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:58,890
training in the companies I think the

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:02,490
same way so how for me so is how we can

00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:04,620
train the young developers to to write

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,200
maintainable code yeah by putting them

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:11,100
in open-source it's my immediate answer

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:15,480
yes so yeah that would be my immediate

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:18,720
answer to that yeah I would like to

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,669
stick to their thing what you mentioned

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,220
there in agile manifesto dates where you

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:29,640
have the sentence that individual and

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:33,059
interactions over processes and tools

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,330
and I can see here something which I

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,210
unfortunately see many many times that

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,120
that people thinks that okay that is

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:45,350
team which I don't understand at all

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,390
because it actually says individuals and

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:51,980
in many actual transformations where I

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:54,870
have been board is the same problem that

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,770
they don't understand that actually it's

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:02,850
agile mindset in in those individuals on

00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:05,850
those teams which really counts and and

00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:08,940
that is that is something what I would

00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:11,549
like to embrace more instead of hiding

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,840
everything behind team concept

00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:18,210
I completely agree so and the same

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,890
applies to methodologies right so and

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,590
I'm yeah I'm it's tough to to arrive to

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,440
a place that

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,260
that are working so hard honest they are

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,200
so passionate about going into that

00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,090
transition and as a consultant go in

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,360
there and see how they are focused so

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,700
much in teams and methodologies which is

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,860
I wouldn't say that it's out of a point

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,680
because at the very end habits change

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,960
mindsets not the other way around so by

00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,240
putting people into different habits is

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,830
the best way to to change the way they

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,200
think but I think it has a lot to do

00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,630
with with effort right

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,210
it's significantly simpler to to promote

00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,170
methodologies within teams than anything

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:07,210
else and so probably the first step and

00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:09,550
you can get great results right but I

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,050
completely agree so one of the things

00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,120
when coming from open source is

00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,370
insisting on individuals and

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,080
interactions and then it's very popular

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,390
well that's that's what the agile

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,390
manifesto says and then you go X exactly

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:27,100
it's the concept of community has some

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:28,870
additional implications some additional

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:43,720
implications but yeah I completely agree

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:47,110
with you the importance to remove the

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,980
waste and and really continuously think

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:54,460
the value focus and and it's all about

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:57,460
the every practical thing what you do

00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:00,940
every day so that that this many times

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,890
really badly are jeopardized and it's

00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,480
something like okay team will solve

00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:09,760
everything yeah thank you very much

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,460
great speech oh by the way I

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,470
I saw your talk yesterday yeah I liked

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,620
it thank you

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:22,360
so I was a bit stuck on on the remote

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:24,430
teams so for me I've worked with within

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,460
and and with the several teams that work

00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:31,000
remote and several teams that that works

00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:33,550
on-site from my experience the remote

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,190
teams can work but the on-site teams

00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,210
always works better from from my view do

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,340
you think it's trained

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:42,039
that that we're going to see that there

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,260
are more distributed teams and is that

00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:47,260
possible to make as good as one

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:52,360
sightings I think there is an an

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:54,960
unstoppable train trend and this is a

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:59,860
conversation that I have had the last

00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:04,440
four four years time after time so many

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:07,510
times and my in my previous job I was

00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,690
the director of a department in 50

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:14,349
around 50 people 9 times on 15 countries

00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,480
fully distributed company and the

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:19,210
challenges there are huge in terms of

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,030
management but the point is that as

00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:26,379
organization you need to develop new

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:28,000
skills right but so you might say well

00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:31,419
you know this is not what we want it

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,179
seems harder but then you look at the

00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:42,129
trend of how where technology is taking

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:45,849
you and the social how the workplace is

00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:48,879
changing and how we are empowering the

00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:52,210
doers so the talent it's it's it's

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,659
starting to be so limited in so many

00:34:52,210 --> 00:35:00,760
areas that engineers can decide where to

00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:02,920
work up to some point so to me coming

00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,720
from the Canary Islands which is a

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,580
special environment because more more

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,670
islands group of islands out there has a

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,830
big central island and then the small

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,380
ones so you can work in land and the

00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,180
Canary Islands have two equally big and

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,400
relevant isla so you end up working in

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:21,670
one all the time you a hundred people

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,380
company will have two sides so yeah so

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,690
coming from there for us it was a

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:29,200
natural thing that we I have been able

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,410
to do to to scale up in open source but

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:37,359
I think is unstoppable now I don't know

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:39,570
I have working in distributed

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,490
environments that works very well and

00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:44,490
compare them to co-located environments

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:50,470
I've seen so many companies that they

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:53,770
think they are doing a good job in

00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,800
in in managing remote teams and they are

00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,690
terrible and when I see the management

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,450
and I look at the experience they have

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:05,079
and it's so little in general that I

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,240
think it's not a fair comparison now yes

00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,310
if if you feel comfortable with

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,300
co-located environment just keep doing

00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:17,740
that try to avoid it as much as possible

00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:20,290
you know and I always recommend that try

00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,480
a fully distributed team try to avoid

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:24,790
the mix environment as much as you can

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,740
because that's a hard one and then also

00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:34,740
a lot of people mix the Geo distribution

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:38,319
with the multicultural factor right with

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:40,690
the changing infrastructure tooling and

00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:43,210
sometimes sometimes even with heavy

00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,640
changes in processes when so it's like

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,980
too many changes at once right so it's

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,130
like now let's go remote and suddenly

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:53,380
you cannot access a chart - or you are

00:36:51,130 --> 00:37:00,520
working the whole day with a VPN it's

00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:03,640
like man this so I am NOT I am NOT

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,970
saying that you are wrong okay it's it

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,730
works for you fine my experience is a

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:11,859
little bit different I like to hear your

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:19,420
thoughts about you talk about a lot of

00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:22,450
processes and about going hot matching

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,490
people my view is that we should stop

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,660
controlling people and more focus on

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:30,760
giving the right circumstances and let

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,280
people actually do the job and remove

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,630
obstacles instead of controlling and try

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,119
to talk too much time but because that

00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,940
will people do also

00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,050
what are your thoughts about that well

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,670
when I think about a July I think a big

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,569
fundamental point of agile is going into

00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:51,480
that direction

00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:55,030
right and when I think about open source

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,000
it was the sign it like that so it was

00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:01,260
decided to keep people of like me and

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,520
completely away from the day-to-day

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,150
daily work from engineers which I

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,329
perfect

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:13,890
understand so I completely agree now the

00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:17,500
question is how you you have a trained

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:19,510
workforce in the culture of controlling

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,029
the people and by controlling the people

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,160
you control the work alright and how you

00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:27,430
move them away from that and if you

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,260
think about it focusing it's it's it's

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,760
very common that you focus a lot of the

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,450
energy when you're going to agile into

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:38,079
engineering assuming that managers will

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:40,059
just simply adapt by by by science right

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,980
maybe the project managers you put them

00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,279
into scrum courses maybe the product

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,349
managers you turn it into product owners

00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:51,270
right and but that's it second level

00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:54,190
senior management you learn right and

00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:57,700
yeah that's that's something that I've

00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:03,150
seen many many times and and it needs to

00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,150
change okay thank you

00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,510
[Applause]
