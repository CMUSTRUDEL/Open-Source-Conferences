	The nature of blockchain-based algorithms make them suitable for solving almost any class of software problems, vastly expanding the field of what is achievable with network computing. At least, if you believe the Internet.
In this talk we'll take a critical approach to the blockchain (with a brief mention of cryptocurrencies), giving an overview of how they work and bringing forward some reasons why, after all, the blockchain might not be the best technology for your next project.
