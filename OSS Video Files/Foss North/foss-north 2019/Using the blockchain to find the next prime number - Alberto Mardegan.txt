Title: Using the blockchain to find the next prime number - Alberto Mardegan
Publication date: 2019-04-18
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	The nature of blockchain-based algorithms make them suitable for solving almost any class of software problems, vastly expanding the field of what is achievable with network computing. At least, if you believe the Internet.
In this talk we'll take a critical approach to the blockchain (with a brief mention of cryptocurrencies), giving an overview of how they work and bringing forward some reasons why, after all, the blockchain might not be the best technology for your next project.

hello everybody thanks for coming to

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,870
these

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,150
presentation my name is Alberto Madigan

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,510
and I'm going to talk to you about the

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,840
blockchain and no we are not going to

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,560
compute any next prime numbers

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,440
the title is trying to make a bit of fun

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,110
about all the hype that there is around

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,130
the blockchain and how sometimes it's

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,820
shown as the solution to any kind of

00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,400
problems so anyway I will start by

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,790
giving a small introduction of the

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,740
blockchain unfortunately yesterday when

00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,560
I was rehearsing my presentation I

00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,930
realized that all the detailed

00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,949
explanation that I had prepare would

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,030
lead to me to overrun like the available

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:12,740
time so I'm sorry but I will give you

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,590
just a very very high high-level

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,930
presentation with many black spots maybe

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,020
the if we will have more time maybe even

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,920
during the questions if you have precise

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:30,149
questions I can try to address them but

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,789
anyway I am terribly sorry but yeah

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:35,399
that's the situation and if if you need

00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:38,789
to know more either you can talk to me

00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,920
later or you can actually find plenty of

00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:43,110
material in the internet plenty of

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,690
videos that are probably going to

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,490
explain it in a better way than I would

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:54,630
be able to so I think it's easier if we

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,810
think about Bitcoin Bitcoin because it's

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,860
the most famous implementation of a

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,039
blockchain it's the oldest and also many

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,640
not all but many most of the aspects

00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:12,300
that are implemented in the Bitcoin

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,630
protocol are also present in many other

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,480
blockchain implementations so we start

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:24,450
with a peer-to-peer network which is

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,310
distributed and decentralized it's a bit

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,709
important to spend a couple of seconds

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,910
to talk about this towards distributed

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,490
and decentralized in English there

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,980
almost synonyms they can be used most of

00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,480
the times interchangeable but in this

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,240
context it's very important to tell them

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,590
apart so when we talk about

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:51,500
decentralized we talk about power

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:55,940
decision-making and decentralized system

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,840
is a system where there isn't a single

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:04,510
node which has more decision power than

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,300
other nodes well as distributed means

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,900
distributed is about work and it has

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,850
where the work happens and where the

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,130
data is told so where the data is

00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,100
processed and where it is told it means

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:23,660
that every node in the network does its

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:28,310
share of work and that's very very how's

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,790
a good definition for a Bitcoin good

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:34,280
Bitcoin matches exactly these two

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:39,670
definitions because it because every

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:44,270
node has the same Authority and it is

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:47,390
computing is it is doing almost the same

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:52,100
exact computations of every other node

00:03:47,390 --> 00:04:00,520
and every node has in itself a copy of

00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:04,459
the data the data which is a blockchain

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:08,380
blockchain looks like this I found this

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,380
picture on the internet it's not mine

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:16,970
literally it is a chain of blocks it's a

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:20,989
very good name blocks which contain data

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,350
in case of Bitcoin it's a set of

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:28,070
transactions of the Bitcoin

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:33,430
cryptocurrency and the important part is

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:36,440
also that yellow line it every block

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,100
holds a reference to the previous block

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,160
and the blockchain is immutable

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:45,700
you can only append new blocks at the

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,700
end of it

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:53,290
so here the part that what I am going to

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:57,630
skip over is actually how blocks are

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,630
added to the blockchain but briefly and

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:04,810
computing like creating a new block

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,790
which is called also called mining is a

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:14,220
very very expensive operation

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:17,290
computation computationally and Bitcoin

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,510
adjusts the complexity the Bitcoin

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:24,280
protocol adjusts the complexity of this

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:27,010
operation so that in average a new block

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:35,260
will be added to the blockchain every

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:39,220
ten minutes the way that blocks are

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,920
created and yeah mind it's based on

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,320
proof of work basically this about the

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,020
consensus mechanism so since every node

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,370
has the same Authority they need to

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,670
agree that the block that has been mined

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,530
by a node is actually valid and is about

00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,040
a proof of work but I will not go

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,710
through this because I don't have time

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:07,360
also about smart contracts I will just

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:10,300
say that they they define the

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,700
transactions or they define what should

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,700
happen when the block is added to the

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:19,840
blockchain so in the Bitcoin case

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,730
they're kind of simple simple programs

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,950
that basically describe the transactions

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,400
they input the output what are the

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:29,080
parties involved the amount of

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,720
cryptocurrency that is to be exchanged

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:36,250
but in a theorem which is another

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,100
blockchain they can really do pretty

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,050
much everything that our computer

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,970
programs can do they can even fetch data

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,110
from external sources and use that as

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,570
condition to decide whether a

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,270
transaction or an operation has to be

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,500
executed or not for example you could

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,950
have like a transaction that is executed

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,550
only if the value of

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:04,340
it is more than X dollars or if the

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:10,670
temperature in a certain city is higher

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:12,650
than 20 degrees or something okay here I

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,740
want mostly to talk about what are the

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,840
issues with a blockchain the first one

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,840
the most obvious one is the energy

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,430
consumption because mining a block as I

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,830
said it's a very computational expensive

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,260
operation which every node in the

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:34,850
Bitcoin network is doing at the same

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:38,570
time we are talking about tens of

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,520
thousands of nodes if not more so it has

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,680
been estimated that the energy

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,690
consumption of the Bitcoin network is

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,420
about 50 terawatt hour per year which is

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:54,410
rather roughly equivalent to five

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:59,000
million households in the United Stated

00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:02,980
States it's a room is well considerable

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,770
considerably less about five times less

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,730
and yeah there is I mentioned here a

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,500
prime coin

00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:16,790
it's another blockchain thats tries to

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:19,730
mitigate maybe the sense of waste about

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:23,870
this energy by actually having a

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:27,380
proof-of-work that involves helping the

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,370
finding of new prime numbers if you

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,800
think that finding a new prime number is

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:37,130
this worthwhile the energy one then it

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,610
doesn't look like waste anymore and here

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,670
I have a quote from the official steam

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,330
website steam is yet another blockchain

00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:50,600
and last year they had to layoff about

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:55,120
70% of their workforce and one of the

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,860
reason they mention for this is exactly

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:03,980
the growing cost of running full steam

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:10,240
nodes the second problem is storage size

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:16,460
running a Bitcoin node requires about

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:21,070
210 gigabytes and this size is growing

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:24,650
at a rate of 5 gigabytes per month about

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:29,600
its room is a bit less but it's about

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:33,020
the same a which point you know this

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,390
doesn't look that bad anymore to me I'm

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,710
making a joke of course we all know that

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,840
this disk space is very cheap but when

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:44,810
you think that every node in the network

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,090
is cutting an exact copy of the data

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,870
well you see that it's not that

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,940
efficient but they if we really want to

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:58,430
find an issue in here is not much the

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,700
storage size but the bandwidth because

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:05,060
all these new five gigabytes of data

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,590
that I mentioned before they're actually

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,970
going to be exchanged over a

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,850
peer-to-peer network it imposes some

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:18,740
bandwidth requirements on running a node

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:23,570
and then another issue is speed in a

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:28,190
Bitcoin Bitcoin is capable of processing

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:33,140
about from 3 to 2 4 transactions per

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:36,170
second in average and a theorem does a

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,150
bit better I think it's about 20

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,960
transactions per second but we're

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:46,150
talking like globally in the whole world

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:49,340
whereas people very centralized system

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:53,770
as being shown to be able to process a

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:58,810
more than 450 transactions per second

00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:03,250
visa is able to process 50 thousand

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,250
transactions per second globally

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:13,929
and one of the reason is that the

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,290
Bitcoin network or the blockchain

00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:19,209
networks in generally yes they are doing

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,970
the same work all the nodes they're

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,670
doing the same work so it's not that the

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,720
overall speed of the network is equal to

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:33,279
the sum of the speeds of every node it's

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,139
kind of more like I wouldn't say that

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,319
it's the same as the fastest of the

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:41,160
nodes it's a better than that but still

00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:44,220
it doesn't grow exponentially or

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,999
proportionally how how we would like to

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,619
and this causes a small problem since

00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,769
you can process only these little

00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:55,839
transactions per second if you want to

00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,089
prioritize transactions to make sure

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:03,759
that it happens in time you need to

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:06,610
request a payment of a fee so part of

00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,879
the cryptocurrency or token that is

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:13,709
being exchanged is being taken by the

00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:18,730
network patent nodes doing the work and

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:22,379
last but not least this may be a bit

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:28,839
controversial it's my opinion at least

00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:31,600
that the Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in

00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,480
generally they are increasing in the

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,059
West disparity why well it's kind of

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,149
simple because the more money you have

00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:43,089
the better Hardware you can afford the

00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:45,309
better bandwidth you can have which

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:50,410
means that the more rewards you will get

00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:54,459
out of the network and I want to talk

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:57,189
now a bit about what applications the

00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:59,139
block chains can have and here I

00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:04,179
honestly want to say that I believe that

00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:06,790
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are most

00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:10,660
likely the best applications for the

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:12,669
blockchain thoroughly when I think of a

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,220
blockchain I think of them and they see

00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:15,730
that there is definitely a point using a

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,630
blockchain

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,579
for this kind of systems

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,660
but then when we come to other

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:23,660
applications

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,449
I've here selected a few and you can

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,300
judge for yourself they have their

00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:33,560
meaning but so this is a voting

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,290
application so your vote ends up in the

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,569
blockchain

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,120
but this software is not open source the

00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:45,110
blockchain is not public it's a private

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,670
blockchain at which point I wonder do I

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:53,060
really trust this more than a state-run

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:55,220
electronic vote I'm not sure and then

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:59,589
mint health solution you store your

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,970
medical records on the blockchain and

00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:05,750
yeah they problem they're trying to

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,180
solve is that all me many many medical

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,399
offices they have different information

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,000
about yourself they know there isn't as

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,880
like real sharing of data so they're

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:24,199
trying to overcome this using the

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:28,339
blockchain then okay here we come a bit

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:32,209
on the strange part so this application

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:35,680
is about your wedding vows vows on the

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:41,149
on the blockchain you can just store

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:44,240
some things of love of course you need

00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:47,540
to pay a small fee for that and a

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,149
similar one is marriage on the block and

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,279
this one you it's about your marriage

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:58,130
certificate which is stored in the

00:14:52,279 --> 00:15:01,069
blockchain there was a interesting lying

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,290
here no more standing in line to get

00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:07,009
married to get a certificate or to

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:10,000
update a marriage status and even more

00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:13,189
important might be in some cases is that

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,339
you can update your marriage status in a

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:18,800
few seconds include divorcing at which

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,350
point I mean why am i keeping that sheet

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,520
of paper in my drawer I wonder if I have

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,890
please and then

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,370
I don't know if you're having some sense

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:33,640
of deja vu here I tell them you're a

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,220
shortener if you have it's wrong because

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,649
in order to shorten our URL through the

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,300
service of course you are going to use

00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:44,560
some of your talking so you're going to

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:49,930
pay essentially and this is a referral

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:54,339
prod referral platform plenty you can

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:58,060
refer employees to companies and you get

00:15:54,339 --> 00:16:00,550
rewarded in talking's so far I was used

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:04,029
that when I was referring someone to my

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,940
company I would get paid in bonuses and

00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:12,670
real money but here you get real

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:15,160
talking's graffiti well it says it quite

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:19,029
clearly you can archive anything in the

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:23,620
blockchain again it's a day on the item

00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:25,810
blockchain it has a cost and if I

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,570
remember correctly talks about that 10

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:33,250
kilobytes of data cost about the

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,260
equivalent of one dollar then there will

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,089
be a limit of the size that you can

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,089
store a very similar one is this wrong

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:43,990
not chain on this one you can even

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,089
choose whether they denote that the data

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,209
that you store whether it's a public or

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,010
a private and I wonder like it seems the

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,690
inception of the internet that we have

00:16:51,010 --> 00:17:00,100
been looking for a way to share share

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:04,780
nodes but finally it is here and steep

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:08,220
shot is photo sharing there is

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:11,290
unfortunately a small limit that is that

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,079
the photo cannot be larger than one

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:17,530
megabyte but we have compression so who

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:22,660
cares and you get money you get tokens

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:25,569
if people like your photo oh this is my

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:30,309
favorite actually paint blocks so you

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:33,720
have this canvas it's split into small

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:37,210
squares small squares 20 by 20 pixels

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,700
you pay to get ownership of

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,250
Square and then you can paint it the way

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,320
that you want until of course someone

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,020
has offers more and then he gets

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,510
ownership of the block and I think that

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,840
by looking at the picture you yourself

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:57,429
will realize why you definitely need to

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,529
to pay for this but now we start getting

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:04,690
serious because this is decentralized

00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:10,059
news network we all know that media is

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,480
fake is biased it's not it doesn't tell

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,260
the truth

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:19,149
basically so let's move journalism to

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:21,880
the blockchain and here you have readers

00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:25,510
who have to pay in order to access the

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,110
content and then writers have to pay in

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,350
order to submit an article for review

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:34,059
but then they get paid back if the

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,779
article is published and if they readers

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,720
like it

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:42,610
you have reviewers who have to pay in

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:46,750
order to be considered for review in the

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:49,779
next article and they get some money

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:56,220
back if readers we like their the

00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:58,390
article that they approved and and this

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,260
decentralized news network has been

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:07,230
featured in quite a few news outlets so

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:10,029
I mean it looks like serious stuff and

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:16,059
here I'm actually ready to bet with

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:17,090
anyone that this is not going to fly but

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:23,480
please if you want

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:26,060
but I I need some money and from news to

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,080
absolute truth this is a fact checking

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:33,980
application how does it work I uses a

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,430
user submits a claim from from a news

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,300
source and then people vote whether the

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:44,540
claim is true or false along with their

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:47,690
vote they put some money at the end

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,900
after some period the money is counted

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:54,460
and the party which has more money wins

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,630
and in this way the truth is established

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,280
and if you win

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:06,440
you also get the money well part of the

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:12,100
money of the party that said fake things

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,100
sorry need to drink something strong

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,400
okay I feel better okay and that was a

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,730
small panoramic of applications that I

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,870
randomly selected I want to spend a

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:35,210
couple of words to talk about the DAO

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:40,190
distributed autonomous organization this

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:44,720
was kind of an incubator for blockchain

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:47,140
based projects it raised about 120

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,270
millions in a crowdfunding campaign and

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,110
about mum one month later it was hacked

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,680
and one third of the money so 40

00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:02,270
millions dollars were stolen basically

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:06,710
and there's nothing special in this

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:10,190
except it was only it was run on the

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:14,300
ethereum blockchain so the if their own

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:17,120
community decided to fork their

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,950
blockchain to the node to the block

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,230
sorry to the block before the heck

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:26,060
happened basically to undo it even

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,090
though it's important to notice that

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,150
this was not a bug in the theorem that

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,840
had to be fee

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,430
by forking Italian didn't have in this

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,230
case at least they didn't have any bug

00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,750
the bug was in the Dow which is an

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:43,260
application built on it still that I

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,200
don't community decided to to fork the

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:50,130
blockchain to undo this and of course

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,820
not everyone agreed so the community

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:57,240
didn't reach consensus and that's why

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,230
the people who didn't agree with this

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,930
decision

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,900
they continued using the unfort

00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:08,550
blockchain which now nowadays is called

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:11,370
as a Tatum classic why do I mention this

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:15,980
because I think it highlights a problem

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:19,560
with the with the consensus mechanism

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,800
and was about the decentralized nature

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:28,430
of the block chains because this

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:31,290
decision to me shows that after all the

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:37,560
at least the ethereum blockchain is not

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:39,540
really decentralized if a small if a

00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,340
small community can decide in this way

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:46,500
can takes such important decisions about

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,580
the destiny I was not sure that to

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,430
include this slide at the end because

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:58,470
it's a bit misleading possibly wrong

00:22:53,430 --> 00:23:00,780
because the placement of these labels on

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:04,590
the quadrants actually depends a lot on

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,160
the underlying implementation but what

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,230
the point that I wanted to make is that

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:14,000
maybe when you are developing an

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:17,540
application you don't always need both

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,390
decentralization and distribute

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:25,320
distributed so you can choose between

00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:28,260
the two and if you don't need both of

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:32,340
them then I would say that blockchain is

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:36,870
most likely not the best solution for

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:42,090
your for a problem I want to conclude

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:46,770
with these so security versus insurance

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:48,330
and the blockchain gives you security it

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,250
is secure but it doesn't give you

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:56,400
insurance so my credit card has ping of

00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:59,490
four digits and these things get stolen

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,100
and hacked all the time but when that

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,380
happens I can go to my bank and get a

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:10,500
complete refund Bitcoin or other

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:12,000
cryptocurrencies are secure really by

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,610
design they are secure but of course

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,710
it's softer so bugs can happen and I'm

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,440
not going to tell you how many times

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:22,140
such bugs have been found and money has

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,820
been stolen in that case it's a

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,850
decentralized network you don't have

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:32,610
anyone to go to then this realization

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,950
versus real world it means that the real

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,830
world is not a decentralized we have

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,320
countries they have borders they have to

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:43,610
make wars between each other they have

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,430
sanctions so if you are going to send

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:52,920
millions of cryptocurrencies to someone

00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:55,290
in Venezuela or North Korea it's not

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,750
necessary going to make their life

00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:00,980
better they will not be able to to use

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:04,760
them and I think that the

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:07,710
cryptocurrencies are good to evade some

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:12,390
limitations but in practice

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm afraid that only they not not only

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,640
but those who make most who can

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,130
potentially make most advantage of them

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,750
are people who are who have a lot of

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:27,150
money because of illegal activities and

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,910
last the blockchain needs a bare form

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,460
like the one that I showed on the third

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,040
slide the chain of blocks it's a very

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:40,830
very good way to have a immutable

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:43,680
storage however it's not different from

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,390
a signed backup sometimes you don't

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,930
really need a blockchain if you really

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:52,990
want to have immutability you can have a

00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:56,620
sign backup hashed backup I mean and

00:25:52,990 --> 00:26:00,690
well a lot of redundancy and that was

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:13,179
all do we have time for questions I

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:25,480
think yeah any questions I see your

00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:28,570
question hi I really liked what you said

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,580
about it's mainly when you need both

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,340
decentralized and distributed that you

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,230
actually need blockchain so do you see

00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,760
blockchain being actually and

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,760
effectively used in something else other

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:49,110
than currencies and even speculative

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:54,130
currencies well I don't have any

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:57,850
concrete examples but I would say

00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:01,120
digital goods possibly the problem is

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:04,210
about the size because they now Bitcoin

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,179
stores transactions it's very they don't

00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,480
require a lot of storage if you're going

00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:14,140
to put in there some kind of certificate

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,539
of course the size grows and you really

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:21,039
want to have like the security of

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:23,980
Bitcoin is also enhanced by having a

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,950
large network of nodes so large network

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:30,370
of nodes also means large replication of

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,649
data and again all the issues that I

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,950
mentioned before so I think having

00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:39,220
digital content in there it's going to

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,159
make the situation worse so in practice

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,200
I am NOT excluding the possibility of

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,960
using it for more things but it should

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,039
be something that doesn't take that much

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,039
space in my opinion

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,330
we have time for one more question

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:05,739
otherwise thank you thank you

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,739
[Applause]
