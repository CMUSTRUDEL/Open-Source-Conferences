Title: Insecure connections: Love and mental health in our digital lives - Molly de Blanc
Publication date: 2019-04-20
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	The lens through which we view--and know--what it means to love, to be ourselves, and to connect with others is now backed by microchips and millions of lines of code. As our lives continue to become increasingly managed by our devices, we need to ask ourselves what we're gaining--and what we're giving up--by allowing technology into the spaces that make our hearts ache and that keep us up at night.
This talk will weave together two narratives essential to many people: health and love. It will examine the ways in which both of these topics have become entwined with computing, what that means for us as individuals, and what that means for our individual and societal user freedoms.

hi I'm Molly de Blanc thanks for coming

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,810
to hang out with me for the next hour

00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm gonna be spend most of this time

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,270
talking about myself so I hope you find

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,860
me interesting by the end of this or at

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:35,440
least I hope you're not bored of me by

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:37,329
the end of this my clicker isn't on this

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,770
session is called insecure Connexions

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,030
love and mental health in our digital

00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:45,430
lives so as a Content warm 8 warning /

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,440
disclaimer here one thing is I'm going

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,010
to be reading all the text on these

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,200
slides in case anyone has problems

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,450
reading them or if you're watching a

00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,610
video later and you just have poor video

00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,320
quality not that the recording itself

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,090
will have poor video quality I'm sure

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,730
it's gonna be great

00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,080
so this talk contains sensitive topics

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,240
including delusional disorders

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,280
depression romance and suicide I think

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,040
romance is probably the most delicate of

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,689
all of these topics if you find this

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,040
triggering or upsetting don't hesitate

00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,750
to leave the room or turn off the video

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,000
at any point we all need to take care of

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:24,369
ourselves first

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,630
so I'm Molly and I I'm a Debian

00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:30,819
developer I am a contributor I'm on the

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,740
board of the open source initiative I'm

00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,170
the campaign's manager of the Free

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,229
Software Foundation and above all I'm a

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,189
free software activist I like to bike I

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:45,310
like to climb I like to bake and cook

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,020
and so I have all these things in my

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,319
life I wear a lot of different kinds of

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,569
hats and in one of these hats especially

00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,200
related to my free software activism I

00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:59,920
spend a lot of time traveling one of the

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,659
places I've traveled is England I inland

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,270
is kind of a weird example when I want

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,700
to talk about my experiences as a person

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,770
who travels because I only ever go there

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,060
for two reasons I go there either

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,740
because I'm in love or I'm crazy I pick

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,209
both of these terms very carefully and

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,520
intentionally I want to talk a little

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,620
bit more right now about what I mean

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,580
when I say I'm crazy I have bipolar

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,780
disorder bipolar disorder is exemplified

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,739
by having periods of depression

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,079
hypomania

00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,560
mania and psychosis those are some of

00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:37,329
the symptoms that someone might exhibit

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,269
anxiety is also common sometimes people

00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:42,700
have comorbidities a comorbidity is when

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:45,879
you have another condition that goes

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,030
along with your diagnosis that's related

00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,530
or similar or just also impacts your

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,540
life

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,659
twenty thirty to forty percent of people

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,299
with bipolar disorder self-harm they

00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:00,639
injure themselves in a number of

00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,400
different ways cutting and burning are

00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,930
two very common examples these are

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,730
things that they do to deal with their

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,209
anger or their depression lack of

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,859
control that they have fifteen fifty

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,200
percent of people with bipolar disorder

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,669
attempt suicide at some point in their

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,480
lifetimes

00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:22,930
and there's an estimate of fifteen to

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,859
thirty percent total mortality rate

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,819
among people with bipolar disorder one

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,219
to three percent of the general

00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,159
population has bipolar disorder that

00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,780
number is from Wikipedia so take that

00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,220
one with the grain of salt

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,720
I have citations for all the rest of

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,190
these statistics if you're curious about

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,639
them they're in my notes so I can't read

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,720
them right now I wanted to use this

00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,669
slide again because it took me a really

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,250
long time and a lot of practice to draw

00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,989
that map of England so I want you all to

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,010
take a moment to like to have the

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:56,409
opportunity to appreciate it

00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:00,849
so England is a place that I've gone to

00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,079
when I've been depressed because for me

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,349
personally one of the things that

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,139
happens is in the winter I go through

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,729
extreme periods of depression and the

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,000
weather in England is better than the

00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:14,620
weather in Boston where I live

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,599
usually in January in February so I

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,199
figure if I'm going to be debilitatingly

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,880
depressed I might as well do it where

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,599
there's a lot of tea and the weather is

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,490
better the last time I was really

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:30,699
debilitatingly depressed I went and I

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:37,210
went to England I was so depressed I

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:39,460
puked in the Tate Modern but I was lucky

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,940
to have people there who wanted to help

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,040
take care of me during this period

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,250
is another condition that a number of us

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,380
have suffered through or enjoyed maybe I

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,630
mean sometimes bipolar disorder is also

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,220
a little enjoyable though it's something

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,960
we're nervous to admit 50 percent of

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,190
adults in the United States are married

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,710
and 18 million unmarried US residents

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,990
live with a partner I apologize for my

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,790
statistics being predominantly us-based

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,780
I didn't know how to find them for

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,480
Sweden so if anyone is like really up on

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,340
the statistical organizations of

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,460
different European countries that would

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,430
be super cool and please tell me later

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,230
so one could argue that more than half

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,330
of the adults in the United States are

00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,720
in love that's an argument and I like to

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,970
think it's true but who really knows

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:43,450
there's also 1 billion tinder swipes per

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:46,240
day this was in I think 2012 which is

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,580
quite a few if you think about it

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,630
so it's not just that people are in love

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,390
and that's the thing that they deal with

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,880
but it's that they are searching for it

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:58,540
as well even if they're not already

00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,040
participating love and bipolar disorder

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,990
and mental health conditions in general

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,910
it turns out are very similar to one

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,940
another they can cause feelings of

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,730
elation we might decide to spend all day

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,510
in on the couch wrapped up in a blanket

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,070
watching the Great British Bake Off

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,480
especially if you're either doing it

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,530
with someone else we're doing it by

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,900
yourself in the dark you can't sleep you

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,240
have trouble sleeping and you have

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,070
racing thoughts you have trouble

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,260
focusing on things you're find yourself

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,530
distracted you find yourself thinking

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,070
about all sorts of things that make the

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,110
rest of your life difficult to live you

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,390
spend money you don't have and you annoy

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,520
your friends it turns out you annoy your

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,840
friends a lot when you're having a

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,800
mental when you have a mental health

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,050
condition or when you're in love Robin

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,080
Dunbar the evolutionary anthropologist

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,780
says that in general in our lives we can

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,729
have five close relationships

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,360
and in this case a close relationship is

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:04,659
defined as someone that we can look to

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,860
for support during periods of emotional

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:11,169
or financial distress so when somebody

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,150
enters a significant lifelong

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:16,360
relationship that number drops from five

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,099
to four which means not only it's not

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,650
just that you lose one friend actually

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:23,770
or one support person you lose two of

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:28,090
them and then one of them is replaced by

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,889
your new partner friends and I use the

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,690
term friends here because I think it's

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,569
great and ideally your lover is also

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,190
your partner our friends are our support

00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:38,379
networks and they're super important

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,469
they provide us with the infrastructure

00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:43,240
we need to like get through being in

00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,680
love to develop our ideas to get through

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,539
our mental health conditions for me

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,409
they've been instrumental in managing my

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,240
bipolar disorder and technology has

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:56,310
really enabled the building of these

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,529
strong relationships especially for me

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,580
our people that we have with us are our

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:05,469
networks we carry them all the time I

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,349
currently don't have mine in my pocket

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:10,560
which is a little disconcerting

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:14,620
currently it's sitting on this table and

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,150
I'm quite glad that it's there so we

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,599
carry them with us and we have them

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:24,460
available whenever we need them all

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,319
right so Margaret Cho once said that if

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,270
you're on a date and you really like

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,110
someone feel free to text them when one

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,669
of you goes to the bathroom and that's

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,380
the kind of thing you can do when you

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,779
have technology and it's the kind of

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,329
thing that provides the opportunity for

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,880
connection one of the other things that

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:44,020
technology provides us with especially

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,420
when we're talking about mobile

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,630
communication is it gives us the

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,930
opportunity to talk in slightly more

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,670
anonymous contexts it's easier for me at

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,470
least it's a lot easier to talk about

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,510
delicate issues when I don't have to

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,160
physically form the words when I don't

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,079
have to talk to someone in personal and

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,449
I don't have to look at them when I can

00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,279
instead go over my sentences and

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:09,570
structure it make sure my ideas are what

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,570
I want to be communicating

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,310
there's an organization called

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,589
Samaritans they provide suicide help

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,149
lions one of the things that they've

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,730
also been experimenting with is by

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,800
providing texting services and these

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,360
texting services I don't know how

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,899
successful they are but I think the idea

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:33,149
of them is just so delightful because it

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:35,399
gives people the opportunity to gives

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,410
people the opportunity to participate

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,769
and to reach out without having to make

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,899
a call and people being interested in

00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,300
making phone calls is something that is

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,860
decreasing fewer people are interested

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,980
in talking on the phone than they used

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,980
to

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:56,010
texting Samaritans access to it it also

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,899
just lowers the bar because texting is a

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,459
lot easier you can do it while doing

00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,740
something else it doesn't have to be

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,560
controlling all of your time but also

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,720
we've created a society while we've

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,540
created societies where it's much more

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,910
acceptable to take your phone out in the

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,070
middle of a conversation and share a

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,529
little something to someone else to

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,390
check the time and in the case it's also

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,149
pretty easy to text someone or detects

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,790
the helpline and say hey I'm having some

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,140
trouble right now can you come pick me

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,630
up can you help me can I know that

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:32,510
you're there a personal example here is

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:35,010
one time I was at work and I started

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,540
disassociating disassociating is when

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,760
you stop feeling connected to your body

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,810
and you start feeling more as though

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,089
you're watching it happen and when I

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,640
disassociate I begin to lose the ability

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,230
to talk so for me it was really great

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,360
that I could take out my phone and I

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,290
could text one of my friends and ask

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,290
them to come pick me up

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,420
so our people form our networks our

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,880
networks provide us with the things that

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,320
we need this is actually a model of my

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,810
network

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,420
I think group chats are really amazing

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:14,339
and provide a great opportunity for us

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:17,190
to be connecting in more ways so two

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,800
tools I use personally our signal and

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,970
whatsapp I actually am not using what's

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,540
up at the moment

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,860
when I drew this one of my support

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:32,850
like systems was on whatsapp and in fact

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,040
at a time refused to be on signal but

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,470
that has since switched and now those

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,320
communications are through signal

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,850
instead so one of the things that what's

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,949
up in signal both provide is they

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:48,389
provide us with encrypted communication

00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:51,360
they create these special kinds of

00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:53,100
spaces where we can be communicating

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,029
with one another because they're

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,820
providing us with a unique set of tools

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:03,089
these tools create safe spaces right

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,910
they create spaces where we can say with

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,579
confidence that the things we're

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,610
communicating with one another are being

00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,470
protected something I particularly like

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,019
about signal is disappearing messages

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,790
I'm surprised that I haven't heard more

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,980
about disappearing messages being used

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,910
for sexting but I think that's really

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,610
the future of it

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,620
disappearing messages allow you to set a

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,149
time limit before a message is deleted

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,269
and actually you can delete a message

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:35,370
after you send it at any point whether

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,660
you want to remove it or you whether you

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,730
want to remove it from Prostate

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,529
posterity or whether you want to just

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,940
like kind of try to make sure that the

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,720
other person doesn't see it in the first

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:50,819
place so those are two really great

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,529
tools provided by signal and one of the

00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,690
things that I think personally is really

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:56,760
great about signal is that it's a piece

00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,220
of software that respects my rights as

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:04,019
an end user which I'll talk a little bit

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,550
more about later so I like to think of

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,069
my group chats especially but my

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,010
conversations in general as being in

00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:12,839
these cozy little places maybe there was

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,170
a fireplace for sitting around in chairs

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,990
and I know that the things I'm saying to

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,970
people are just between us and that

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,149
that's what a in some ways makes them

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,819
special but it also makes sure that what

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:31,620
we're saying to one another is something

00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:34,880
that's just between us these sorts of

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,400
spaces can help us whether we're in love

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,470
trying to form the ideas behind that or

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,370
whether we're in bad moods whether we're

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:47,690
having problems when we're not feeling

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:50,570
well when we're having episodes someone

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:56,000
I know was going through a manic episode

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:58,850
and during this time the rest of their

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,040
support network formed a signal group

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,350
chat which enabled them which enabled us

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,550
to coordinate different points of care

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,540
to make sure that they weren't alone to

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,070
simultaneously all check in with one

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,330
another

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,130
about what was going on and about like

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,790
the health status of this person that we

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,430
cared about and because we were using

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,380
signal in addition to like the

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,930
convenience of the group chat system in

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,910
addition to knowing that when I traveled

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,000
abroad I would still have access to this

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,100
community of people I knew that we would

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,640
be doing so with the technology and the

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,070
conversations encrypted oh one of the

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,770
other things that technology gives us is

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,970
when we're sad especially but also when

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,410
we're happy and when we're in love we

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:48,610
need the ability to envision the future

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:51,950
one of the things that happens among

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:54,920
depressed youth and trans youth trans

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,710
youth is a very good example is they are

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,960
provided with spaces on the internet and

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,790
in their conversations where they can

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,440
explore their identities and they can

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,720
find out who they are they can like it's

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,070
it's safe it can be safe to say to a

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
friend privately I really like this

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,400
person and this is how I feel like our

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,800
relationship is going to be developing

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,810
but it's also important to be able to

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,120
remind yourself or have other people

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,740
remind you that you know your periods of

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,690
depression your periods of hypomania

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,760
your even your periods of mania and

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,100
psychosis are things that you go through

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,420
and there are things that end and

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:35,420
there's a life after them so there are a

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,790
few problems though with technology and

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,550
a lot of some of them at least come down

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,850
to interoperability

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:46,960
interoperability is the idea that two

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,040
technologies work together well

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,960
or can work together at all at least

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,000
that's the definition I'm using right

00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:58,220
now so I want to use emoji as an example

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,320
emoji are super important in the

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,060
development of relationships it turns

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,190
out that when people are more interested

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,690
in a potential partner they use more

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,460
emoji in their conversations so it turns

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,810
out that emoji look different on

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,650
different people look different

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:17,960
differently different look different

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:19,490
they look thank you for your patience

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,370
they look different on different

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,850
people's phones when I was working on

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,660
this

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,340
I looked up emoji compatibility charts

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,440
and I realized for the first time like

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,240
somebody I know would send me this this

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,430
like emoji that to me was like two

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,570
people kissing it's like that's a really

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,950
bold social move interesting but it

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,420
turns out that on their phone it was

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,620
just like two little blobs with the

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,840
heart between them another case is I

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,550
have a friend who would send me this

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,380
face that always looked embarrassed to

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,700
me and I just thought oh god I said

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,340
something terrible and I made them

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,760
uncomfortable but it turns out on their

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,170
phone it was like this big happy smile

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,760
and that for them it was sharing you

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,320
think so on both of these cases it's

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,440
people sharing different kinds of

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,970
emotions that we can't interpret because

00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,640
we're having this issue with the

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,800
interoperability

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,190
there's also interoperability of file

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,190
types I know someone who had a brain

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,880
injury a brain injury is like serious

00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,709
trauma to your brain different kinds of

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,930
side effects that you get out of it is

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,530
you can have personality changes you can

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:37,130
become angry regularly all the time you

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,440
can be depression is super common the

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,720
development of anxiety but one of the

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,260
biggest most common things that happens

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,170
is you lose memory like you become

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,450
unable to build new memories or you have

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,600
trouble developing remembering things

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,480
from the past so this person I know what

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,190
they did was they had an iPad and they

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,130
used their iPad to remember

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,650
everything they used it to keep track of

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,900
the times that they needed to take their

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,060
medication when they were supposed to

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,410
eat meals because knowing when you're

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,980
hungry might not always be the easiest

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:16,230
thing knowing the people in their lives

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,360
when people are coming to visit but also

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,180
like just kind of keeping track of

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,170
everything going on so when they updated

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,330
their iPad which I don't remember if it

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,550
was a forced update or an optional

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,670
update but there are more forced updates

00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:36,000
these days they lost the ability to

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:38,400
access their note files and these note

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,350
files had been what they what they'd

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,340
been using to build themselves to

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:49,400
remember themselves and to have a strong

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,400
interaction with the rest of the world

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,450
so there are some other ways that

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,960
technology comes into play in our lives

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:01,050
especially in building relationships if

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,860
you've ever watched something with

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,350
somebody else

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,880
streaming suddenly you're building a

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,980
relationship and a shared experience

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,420
around a technology if you're doing it

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,870
where you're in two separate places

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,580
especially if you're trying to sync your

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:22,200
videos by starting them at the same time

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:25,470
for example like then you're dealing

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,000
with another layer of Technology fitting

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,950
into the conversation when you're

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,890
looking at the security of your internet

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,980
connection whether that's working when

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,630
you're dealing with lag times or when

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,280
you're dealing with like small

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,560
differences between how your web

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,570
browsers are working what's somebody I

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,430
know did to try to compensate for this

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:50,010
is he developed a piece of software that

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:54,870
worked with VLC player to sync two

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:58,590
copies of to sync two editions of VLC so

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,610
that one person could pause it and that

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,860
would also pause it on the other

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,290
people's screen and this worked in both

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,230
directions so it turned the remote

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:09,420
viewing experience from something that

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,820
you kind of had to try to make work

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,929
together to something that actually just

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,790
worked

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:16,860
it created for them a new type of shared

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,130
experience that made them feel more

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:23,970
personally connected to one another

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,900
buying people presents or buying things

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,390
in general is something that many of us

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,780
do significantly online I know I don't

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:37,860
really like going to stores so I enjoy

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:40,500
being able to use online tools recently

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,429
I wanted to impress someone by picking

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,929
out the perfect book for them I was like

00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,880
I'll get them I'll get them in eBook

00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:51,120
because that will be better they they

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,990
live in the UK this is a very important

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,210
detail in this story so I purchased a

00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,900
book on Amazon and I really don't like

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:04,169
using Amazon for many reasons including

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,090
but not limited to I know that they're a

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,980
books all have DRM on them they have

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,290
digital rights management or digital

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,910
restrictions management technology that

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:18,570
encumbers and prevents access to them

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:20,490
over different times so I bought this

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:24,900
book and I had Amazon send it to this

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:27,990
person and Amazon said oh well actually

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:33,540
they can't access it because you bought

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:35,370
a US Edition and not a UK Edition so I

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,010
thought okay I'll buy a UK edition

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,020
instead like this is annoying actually

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,590
even before I bought the UK Edition or I

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,830
went to do that hint something happens

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,840
there before I went to buy the UK

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,480
Edition I was talking with the customer

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,169
service people at Amazon and they said

00:21:51,480 --> 00:22:00,299
oh well what we can do instead is we can

00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:03,330
give you a car like a gift card and you

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,350
can use that gift card like you could

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,200
give it to them or you could use it

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,870
yourself and I thought okay well I can

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,179
give them this gift card and that's at

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,450
least me kind of participating in this

00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,100
process a little bit still like I don't

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,500
like giving gift cards but it's better

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,760
than nothing here so it turns out that

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,830
they actually couldn't use the gift card

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,990
either because the gift card only worked

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,990
on us Amazon the gift card wasn't USD

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:35,140
so that didn't work then I thought okay

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,490
now I'm gonna try to just buy the book

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,530
on UK Amazon so I go to do that and it

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,720
turns out that if I'm logged into Amazon

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,760
I can't even view what ebooks are on the

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,060
UK site because I can't purchase one

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,650
from being outside of the UK and what's

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:56,980
interesting is for some reason I have a

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:59,020
UK Amazon account I don't know why oh it

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,940
is automatic oh I thought it wasn't and

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:08,710
it was like really cool that I had done

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:11,380
this thing well wow that's boring so I

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,780
have so I log in but I can't view the

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,290
prices of e-books they don't show up at

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,170
all

00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,520
when I look for them so I have to open

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,380
up a private window to find the prices

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,360
of e-books and I can't purchase one

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,600
without logging in and once I log in I

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,570
lose access to that so suddenly my

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,670
options are ask somebody else to do this

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:39,700
give up or try to figure out another

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:41,530
financial exchange so in the end I

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:46,060
purchased a gift card for the exact

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,740
amount of the books and because this was

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,000
for a British person it was a little

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,490
embarrassing because now they knew

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,280
exactly how much the gift cost and while

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,690
that's faux pas in many places I'm under

00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,110
the impression that talking about money

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:04,060
in England is like especially bad no I

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:05,860
see a head shake there so maybe not and

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,710
this was this was a problem that I had

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,930
and this was this long drawn-out process

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,840
that really came down to the fact that I

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,740
couldn't purchase this book I couldn't

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,200
download it myself and I couldn't send

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,610
it to them through any medium and this

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,470
was because of the restrictive

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,410
technologies that had been placed on the

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:30,340
file something else that we do for each

00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:32,800
others we build playlists there's like

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,780
the modern mixtape that we make for each

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,740
other where we make a playlist and

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,460
something like Spotify or YouTube and

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,880
when we do

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,650
that we're putting our way that we're

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,930
putting this gift we have made for

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:50,860
someone in the hands of a company of

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:54,610
another actor who now has the ability to

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:57,310
take that away from them at any point it

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,320
has the ability to take down the videos

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,410
or the songs to cycle those things out

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,940
and to remove your opportunity to share

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:08,770
this thing that you built with another

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,600
person I actually still have the CD at

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,690
my parents house of the first mixtape

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,110
somebody ever made me and if I want to

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,970
go through the nostalgia of being 15 I

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,780
don't know why anyone would want to

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,370
remember being 15 but if I want to do

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,320
that I could listen to it and I could

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,390
either do that from the perspective of

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,870
like oh yeah these songs were great in

00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,520
the early 2000s or I could do it from

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,910
the perspective of like remembering what

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,280
young love feels like remembering that

00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,870
excitement of this kind of gift so

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,820
that's something I'm able to do with it

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,890
because it's this piece of technology

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,840
that isn't restricted with the kinds of

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,150
tools that we have now and that we're

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,710
using all the time on files especially

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:56,350
on streaming files I'm gonna talk about

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,290
Harry Potter now Harry Potter is very

00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,700
important to me I'm a big fan I've not

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:04,450
been to Harry Potter world yet but I

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:08,200
dream about going someday there's a

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:11,470
particular set of DRM free copies of

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,660
Harry Potter that a number of people I

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,870
know actually have it's right by Stephen

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Fry and their thing I've listened to a

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,670
lot one of the things that happens when

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,700
you're depressed especially as you spend

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:27,160
your time waiting you're waiting to wake

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,760
up in the morning you're waiting to go

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:34,630
to sleep at night when you can't in many

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,120
cases you're waiting for until it's time

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,520
to do the next thing that you have to do

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,050
you're waiting for the next meal or

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,940
you're just waiting for the period of

00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,730
depression to be over because that's all

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,940
you can do to fight it there is no

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,460
fighting it at times so Harry Potter for

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,990
me was like the first time I listened to

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,409
the books on tape having read

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:58,360
books before it provided me with this

00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:59,049
kind of comfort Stephen Fry has a lovely

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,669
voice

00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,690
he does voices for all the characters I

00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:07,779
recommend them if you have the

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:12,399
opportunity to listen but I suddenly had

00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:15,130
this piece of comfort with me all the

00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:17,080
time I remember listening to it on

00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:20,740
planes I listened to it while I was

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,659
camping I listened to it in hotel rooms

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,860
as I was traveling to conferences and

00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:29,890
for work so I had this copy of this

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:35,020
story that provided me with comfort I

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:38,760
needed I consider Harry Potter to be

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:41,289
life saving and not a number of people

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,789
I've heard of a number of people saying

00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:44,830
Harry Potter has been life saving to

00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:48,370
them because rather than killing

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,590
themselves they wanted to wait to learn

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,390
how the series ended but for a number of

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:56,860
people I know Harry Potter is a life

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,480
saving technology because it provides

00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,860
them with this source of comfort it

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,200
provides them with this thing that they

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,090
need while they're waiting or while

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,179
they're depressed it provides them with

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,220
the feeling of not being alone because

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:16,539
they have this human voice talking to

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:20,049
them this is so abilify or also known as

00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:21,299
air pip rizal is a drug used for

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:26,140
treatment

00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:28,090
it's a conjunctive therapy so it's used

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,950
if you have other if you're taking other

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:35,289
especially antidepressants or mood

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:42,630
stabilizers and when you are taking

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:45,490
abilify MySite you have well anyway so

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,279
abilify or abilify is the regular one

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:50,770
abilify MySite is a digital drug a

00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,620
digital drug specifically is something

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,299
that has some kind of tech not like

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,880
computing technology built into the

00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:01,419
medication in this particular case

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,590
there's a sensor on it so when you take

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:07,210
a pill the sensor becomes like is is

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,370
metabolized as

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:14,750
during the process and you wear another

00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:17,720
sensor on your body so that sensor picks

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,830
up where in your body and we're in the

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:26,419
metabolization process the abilify is at

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,490
now that then talks to an app and your

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:31,279
doctor has access to the information in

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:34,820
this app there are lots of problems with

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,590
us it turns out and I don't know how

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,740
it's been tested in the field but from a

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,389
conceptual standpoint what we see with

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,360
something like this is we see a

00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:46,850
possibility for an insecure space

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,399
between what's being communicated you're

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,980
seeing a lack of data control and you're

00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:54,980
seeing this especially like around

00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:59,509
something that is hugely stigmatized

00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,850
right when when people

00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:05,629
well when some people some types of

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:08,840
people perform violent act like publicly

00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:10,610
violent acts their mental health comes

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,500
into the conversation they talk about

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,340
whether they are medicated or have been

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,470
medicated you can lose relationships

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,409
with people I know a number of people

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,269
who have had marriages and romantic

00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:26,830
relationships of all types and and break

00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:30,470
up because of their mental health issues

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:33,110
so suddenly you're putting this thing

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:36,710
that lets people know one of your

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,940
biggest secrets if it's a secret but

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,100
let's people know one of these like

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,899
really intimate things about you it's

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,649
putting it out into the world into a way

00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:50,120
that you have no control over and to me

00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:52,279
that's really scary so a lot of this

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,159
stuff that I've been talking about comes

00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:57,230
down to privacy all right so when we

00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,789
want to build our private spaces whether

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,009
we're talking about the privacy of our

00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:05,600
data the privacy of our bodies and our

00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:07,490
bodily autonomy we're looking at what

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,870
enables that and what enables that is

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:13,570
security all right so when we have ways

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,580
that information is being communicated

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:20,840
across systems across computers between

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:23,570
people between organizations we

00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,850
to know that it's private and the only

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:30,200
way to do that is by knowing that the

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:32,499
way it's moving is secure now security

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,210
cannot exist without software freedom

00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:38,059
there are a lot of reasons why this is

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,340
the case some of the ones that I find

00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:43,899
interesting especially are the idea of

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,399
accountability in design and development

00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:49,820
something that comes up this is a kind

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,559
of like a data issue rather than

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:58,429
explicitly like a software issue which

00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,100
is people companies or developers when

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,440
working on things will keep personal

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,149
data in different files like personal

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,990
data for themselves sometimes including

00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:15,379
passwords there was one particular data

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:19,070
breach I think it was goober but I'm not

00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:24,249
sure off the top of my head where what

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:28,610
happened was some developers had left

00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:32,529
their passwords in their repos in their

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,999
files and when this was going on

00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:36,769
somebody got into their system

00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:38,179
somebody saw these passwords someone

00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:41,289
were able to log in and then they were

00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:44,179
able to steal very large amounts of data

00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:46,039
so one of the things that you get when

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,679
you have software freedom when you have

00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,389
software that is accessible that people

00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,940
can study that people can look at that

00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:56,299
people can modify and change and use and

00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,340
share you have a new level where

00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:02,149
developers are suddenly need to be more

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,379
accountable to their users I think

00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,789
that's one of the most interesting cases

00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,950
because it's one that I didn't really

00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:09,619
think about for a long time I thought

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:13,999
about people studying code I thought

00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:17,330
about and people do study code it turns

00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:19,639
out I know someone who for a while at

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,190
least had this hobby of getting IOT

00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:24,259
devices and figuring out where there

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:29,809
were insecure parts of them and then

00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:34,220
writing Amazon reviews so people people

00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:35,309
will engage in that security through

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:40,169
obscurity doesn't work

00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:42,360
alright bye when you have software

00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:47,519
freedom when you have the idea that

00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:50,639
software and code is accessible you're

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,519
putting it out in the open right and by

00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:55,379
merely hiding those tools that are

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,889
that's that are supposedly making your

00:33:55,379 --> 00:34:00,809
software secure what you're doing is

00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:02,549
you're putting them in a place where if

00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:06,059
somebody finds a security vulnerability

00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:07,980
there is no way for them to fix it the

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,929
number of security vulnerabilities are

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,440
worth a lot more on an open market than

00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:14,909
they're worth reporting as bugs so

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,159
you're kind of trusting people who find

00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,050
them to do that reporting so you don't

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,440
really know if you can be trusting these

00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:24,510
technologies right trusting technology

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,270
comes down to consent whenever we're

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,849
using something we should be consenting

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,770
to use it knowing as much as possible

00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:34,020
you know I think software freedom and

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,929
user freedom the most important part of

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:40,169
it comes down to me being able to know

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:42,359
and trust a piece of technology to be

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:44,790
able to use that technology with

00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:49,050
confidence right to be able to consent

00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:50,970
to using that technology and the only

00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,740
way that can happen is when that

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,569
technology is something that I can

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,730
understand or that someone I trust can

00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:58,260
understand it's only possible when I

00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:03,900
know that there's accountability within

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:06,000
the system so consent comes from user

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,250
freedom user freedom comes from software

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,020
freedom and software freedom comes from

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,230
the philosophies ideas and licensing

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,849
behind free and open source software so

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,560
the technology that people are building

00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:17,460
that it are the technologies people are

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,800
building that our free and open-source

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,869
aren't valuable to this whole

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,849
conversation they're what builds it

00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:28,680
makes it possible it makes it possible

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:30,660
for me to consent to what I'm doing but

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,859
one of the things with all of this when

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,750
you're using free open-source software

00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:36,180
is you actually still need to trust

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,089
other people and for someone like me who

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,000
doesn't code I have to trust people like

00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,890
a number of you who do I have to trust

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,599
that you'll be doing those assessments

00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,540
that you'll be building things ethically

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,220
that you'll be building things well

00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,640
that what you give me and what you tell

00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,440
me is safe is safe they're still

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,990
actually a lot of different kinds of

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,930
things that we could talk about

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:02,910
especially in the relationship between

00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:05,240
technology and the role technology plays

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,320
in our lives

00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:12,180
proprietary javascript is a good example

00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:15,270
that's something that I know a number of

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,910
people care about very strongly because

00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,820
proprietary JavaScript is creating these

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,780
insecurities in your systems and it's

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,890
something that's running on many

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:29,210
websites we could talk more about DRM

00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:32,070
and the kinds of things people have lost

00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,500
we could talk about gaining apps

00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:37,800
I think gaining apps are like a really

00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,160
great example of the way technology

00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,620
plays into our love lives but also the

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,840
way that like we're not trusting or we

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:50,640
shouldn't be trusting the way technology

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:53,010
is playing into our love lives so I I

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,930
have to ask at the end of this like will

00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,340
free software see of the day you know I

00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,110
spent a lot of time talking about

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,390
technology in general and pointing out

00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,480
problems but I didn't spend a lot of

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:05,970
time talking about whether by building

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,160
ethical technologies or by using ethical

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,950
technologies we're going to solve these

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,900
problems and the answer is I don't know

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,820
and if you know I would love to hear

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,710
that I hope it's the case I very

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,690
strongly hope that free and open source

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:22,620
software will provide us with this

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:25,140
glorious future where everybody is

00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:28,260
everybody has access to the resources

00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,880
that I have access to and that the

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,580
resources I have access to our better

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,010
and have fewer problems like right now I

00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,260
can install install signal desktop on my

00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,180
debian machine because it doesn't work

00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,920
so if you know how to do that and you

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,470
want to find me later and help me with

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,520
that that would be super cool but no

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,620
pressure guys so I asked myself you know

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,450
like will free software be this be this

00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,300
great democratizing tool will it help

00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,790
everybody will it help me will continue

00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:01,470
to help me and how how much does it

00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:04,950
actually help me so that depends on you

00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,839
this means and in you when I say you I'm

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,180
talking to developers but I'm also

00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,420
talking to the system administrators who

00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:15,930
help support the who help support these

00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,790
systems I'm talking to the designers who

00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,220
make things look certain ways who make

00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:22,650
things usable and accessible I'm talking

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,650
to the translators to the illustrators

00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,750
to the project managers who just show up

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,390
for a day and give some advice on how

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,119
something should be developed and better

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,470
ways for technology to work the leaders

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,119
the people who are doing bug reporting

00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,440
everyone who's interacting with a piece

00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:43,440
of software is responsible for building

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,450
ethical technology whether we're doing

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,280
that by making demands or requests from

00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:50,579
companies that are building proprietary

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:56,160
closed dangerous risky software or we're

00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:59,400
building it ourselves so the things that

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,750
you can do is you can think about when

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,130
you're building something don't just

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,810
think about your own needs for it and

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,030
don't just think about what the

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,700
requirements are for it but think about

00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:12,030
how it fits into a narrative of ethics

00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,540
ask yourself how does this help people

00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,150
who is using it what kinds of needs do

00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,730
they have I want you to think about me

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:23,520
and how security and privacy are really

00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,400
important to me how having adaptive

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,810
technologies that are easy for me to use

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,819
are really important you know when I

00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,250
have a psychotic episode when I have an

00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:35,339
episode of disassociation

00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,740
I can't easily communicate with people

00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,650
so being able to quickly type something

00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,910
or to quickly send a message is great

00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:46,680
all right when you're looking at people

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,420
who want to communicate with one another

00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,849
whether they want to send pictures think

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,390
about how those things are being moved

00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:55,890
around um think about the everyday user

00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,420
but also think about all the fringe

00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:01,380
cases think about people who have

00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,180
accessibility issues people who don't

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,089
speak your native language people who

00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,980
don't speak English especially I deeply

00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:09,690
appreciate that I'm able to give this

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,760
talk in English by the way so thank you

00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,650
all for spending years learning my

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,599
language well I definitely don't speak

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:19,119
any of you

00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,329
but this is also about you because

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,130
here's someone who knows about ethics

00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:26,829
and technology because you've thought

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,369
about the ways that these things fit in

00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:32,529
together so I hope that you'll go out

00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:34,539
and like one of the things you'll be

00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:37,959
doing is in the future you'll be talking

00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:40,479
with others about these tools you'll be

00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:42,369
helping people set up signal accounts or

00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:45,219
what's epic what's happens proprietary

00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:47,619
software I know this it uses the Oprah

00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:52,239
open whisper systems encryption tool

00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:56,349
which at least is something but I will

00:40:52,239 --> 00:41:01,719
only recommend signal because it's free

00:40:56,349 --> 00:41:03,309
software so help people set up these

00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:07,209
tools help people understand their

00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:09,429
technologies and and talk to them talk

00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:11,559
to companies talk to your employer's use

00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:13,209
the tools that you have available to you

00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,219
to make sure that the things that you're

00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:17,920
building are not just ethical but are

00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:19,869
taking into account all like the huge

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,539
range of needs that come from different

00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:24,039
users you know it's our job to raise

00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:26,739
awareness because we know what's going

00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:30,939
on it's our job to talk to others and

00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:34,349
it's our job to like it's our job to be

00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:37,119
building this future together all right

00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:39,279
we're doing a great job we have built

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,559
amazing things we built incredible

00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:44,289
things right free software is in space

00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:46,299
how cool is that

00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:47,890
like my favorite Debbie and anecdote is

00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:51,539
that the International Space Station has

00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:54,130
been running Debian like that's so cool

00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:56,049
but also it's really cool that I have

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:57,939
IRC and I can talk to my friends all day

00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:02,559
long and that I have signal and I can

00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:05,469
talk to them about terrible things that

00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:08,650
I have these ways to share with the

00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:10,689
people in my life so we've been doing a

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,819
great job but we still can do better all

00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:15,789
right free software is famously hard to

00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:17,499
use so we can do better on that front

00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,259
and we can do better when we're thinking

00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:22,539
about the tools we're building so what I

00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:25,390
really want you to walk away from this

00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:27,930
with is the idea that everything is

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:31,320
actually a technology issue

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:35,880
I do a talk with Karen Sandler from the

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,790
software freedom Conservancy about how

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,140
everything is a technology issue so if

00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:43,230
you're interested in that there's a cool

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,590
video it's a lot of fun but and it's a

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,910
conversation I'm happy to have so I want

00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,940
you to have this idea in this

00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:55,620
understanding that things that we might

00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,820
not think about as ethical technology

00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,110
issues things that we might not be

00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,420
thinking about as free and open-source

00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:03,960
software issues in fact are because

00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,330
technology is extremely pervasive and in

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,740
any part of our life where we're having

00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,450
a piece of technology when we're having

00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,580
a piece of computing technology

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,440
especially interacting with that which

00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,540
is basically everything like you can't

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,930
use cash in Sweden that's what I've

00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:20,670
learned and being here this is my first

00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:24,450
time here it's great I love it but you

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,890
can't use cash like suddenly there's

00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,630
like this whole another layer to

00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,390
computing technology that we're

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:32,700
interacting with every day so that's

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:36,960
what I have I'd really like to thank you

00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,190
for listening I'd like to thank you for

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,170
thinking about what I'm saying I'd like

00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,850
to thank you for coming here I'd also

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,680
like to thank the organizers of Faust

00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,660
North for inviting me and helping me get

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,410
here it's been a lot of fun at this

00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,720
conference

00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:52,350
my name is Molly de Blanc you can find

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,860
me on Twitter at millions and my slides

00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,190
are CC by-sa some of these slides are

00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,640
already available on my get lab account

00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:04,869
and the this will be up soon so that's

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,930
what I have

00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:06,930
you
