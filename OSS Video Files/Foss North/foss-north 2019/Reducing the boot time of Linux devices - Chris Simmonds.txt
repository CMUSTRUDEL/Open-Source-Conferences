Title: Reducing the boot time of Linux devices - Chris Simmonds
Publication date: 2019-04-20
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	We all want our devices to boot faster, but how much effort do you want to dedicate to optimizing and maintaining a custom kernel and apps? This presentation offers a graded list of things you can do to reduce boot time. They start with simple changes, such as adjusting the position of your main application the init sequence. Then there are the changes you can make to the kernel and bootloader configuration to speed things up, and finally, there are moderately advanced techniques such as using U-Boot in falcon mode.
All of this is done using standard configuration techniques, with the idea of being able to maintain these changes in the future. I will show the effect of each of these changes on typical a embedded dev board so that you can judge for yourself where on the journey you want to jump off.
