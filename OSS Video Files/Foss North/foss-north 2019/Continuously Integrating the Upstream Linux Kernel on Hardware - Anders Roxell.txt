Description: 
	The aim of this project is to continuously test one of the biggest open source projects on hardware and in qemu. The project started to continuously run functional tests on TS kernels. Tests that gets run are kselftest, ltp, and libhugetlbfs. Running tests on actual hardware isn’t as easy as you may think. Failing tests, hanging tests or flaky tests are some of the issues. The project that was going to run tests on real hardware is called Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT). LKFT uses infrastructure software like Jenkins, LAVA, SQUAD and bugzilla for building, testing, displaying and tracking regressions of the LTS, mainline and next kernels. LKFT was created in early summer 2017, and the project has helped to enable LTS kernels being supported for 6 years. KernelCI is also used to build and boot testing, and today kernelCI also implements functional tests. --- Anders hates running tests and therefore he loves automating them. He has been working with Linux kernels for telecommunication (e.g. base stations, media gateways) as well as various drivers and RTOS’s for automotive systems (e.g. engine-, gearbox-platforms). He has also experience from NFV/Openstack.
