Description: 
	The future of computing is tiny. Most computers are not desktop, laptops, tablets or mobile phones, but microcontrollers. Small, integrated systems with a few KB of RAM. And their presence is ever growing. Last year alone 31 billion (!) of them were shipped, up from 23 billion in 2015. And they get more capable every day. A modern embedded system has threads, can run Python or JavaScript, and use machine learning models. Why are you not developing for them yet?
In this talk you'll learn that microcontrollers are not scary, that there's no magic involved, and that working in very constrained systems is actually very fun! You'll also learn a thing or two about getting things to run for years on a battery, try that with a web app. In this talk we'll use Mbed OS, the largest open source Real-Time Operating System for microcontrollers. In 2018 over 17,000 commits were landed in the project, it has over 400 unique contributors, and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
