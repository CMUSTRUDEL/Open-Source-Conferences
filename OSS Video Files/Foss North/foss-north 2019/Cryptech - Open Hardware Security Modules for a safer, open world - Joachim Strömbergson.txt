Title: Cryptech - Open Hardware Security Modules for a safer, open world - Joachim Strömbergson

Description: 
	The CrypTech Hardware Security Module (HSM) Project is an international project developing an open-source hardware cryptographic engine design that meets the needs of high assurance Internet infrastructure systems. Until today, HSMs used for CA certificate signing, DNSSEC and Tor, for example, were highly expensive, proprietary tamper protected black boxes. CrypTech is changing that, making HSMs open and available to everyone.
The goal of the CrypTech project is to create an open-source hardware cryptographic engine that can be built by anyone from public hardware specifications and open-source firmware and operated without fees of any kind. In the talk we will describe what the Cryptech Alpha HSM is, the status for the project, some of the experiences we’ve had designing open crypto hardware, PCBs and FPGAs.
