Title: Calamares - the Linux System Installer - Adriaan de Groot

Description: 
	As long as Linux isn't pre-installed on your hardware, you need to install it yourself. The big five Linux distro's have their own tools, but for the hundreds of boutique distro's with specialised purposes, those tools are not (necessarily) suitable. Calamares is a Linux System Installer that is built to be customisable and tailorable for boutique distro's. It encourages shared development and cooperation for derivatives, spins, mixes and niche players.
In this short talk we'll look at the why and the what of Calamares (and probably also some "yeah, this needs work" items as well).
