Title: Docs or it didn't happen! - Mikey Ariel
Publication date: 2019-04-19
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	If you ever skimmed through a README, tried to follow a quickstart tutorial, attempted to decipher an error message, or typed '--help' in your console, congratulations -- you have encountered documentation!
Long gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about your software. Today's users are smarter and less patient, which means that we no longer need to document *all the things*, as long as what we do document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that's where the real work starts.
Documentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn't neatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don't Panic(tm)! No matter what your role is, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.

hi everybody welcome to doctor I didn't

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,420
happen this is a talk that I've given a

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,860
few times in the last few years and I

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,020
like to take it to open source

00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,090
conferences to share some things that

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,939
are happening in the documentation world

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,560
in an open source context so I'm very

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,540
happy to be here I'm really glad that

00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,190
they invited me to give this talks first

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,530
time I'm in Gothenburg and it's really

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,050
pretty the weather is really nice so and

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,690
the people are great so well why are we

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,120
here here as in in this room this is not

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,989
an existential question why are we in

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,030
this talk and so I'm hoping I'm gonna

00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:56,269
make certain assumptions as we go

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,679
forward that we want to have more users

00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,839
and contributors to our open-source

00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,300
projects we want to increase adoption

00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:03,829
right adoption is the name of the game

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,980
we believe or we want to believe that

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,470
documentation can help us but something

00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:13,430
is stopping us for some reason or

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,200
another we are struggling with improving

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,530
our documentation we maybe don't know

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,520
how we might have some limitations and

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,579
I'm just gonna give you a couple of

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,920
housekeeping notes I would appreciate if

00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,740
we kept any kind of flame wars around

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,600
technology at the door one of the great

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,250
things I love about working in a

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,229
documentation field is that I get to

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,060
interact with a lot of different types

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,579
of technology a lot of programming

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,070
languages and I love it all I love it

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,240
all it's all great and I love the things

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,820
that are happening in the open source

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,369
world and the other thing I'm going to

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,409
mention is that this talk is about 45

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,930
minutes and I do not do onstage

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,850
questions so I will be hanging out at

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,500
the Red Hat booth most of the time or

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,810
nearby you can probably recognize me

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,210
from there come and find me and ask me

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,100
questions I also do consulting for open

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,020
source projects so if you have something

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,630
specific you want to ask me about then

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,820
I'm happy to help you out I'll be here

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,670
today and tomorrow until a little bit a

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,260
free lunch time so Who am I who is this

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,960
person with the crazy hair talking to

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,360
you my name is Mikey Arielle I am from

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,810
Israel but I live in Prague for the last

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,120
three years I work at Red Hat I'm a

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,700
technical writer for OpenStack platform

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,990
which means I read a lot of Python and I

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,480
don't really know what it does but

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,480
somehow it works and I used

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,209
to work in openshift and also in the

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,549
JBoss space I've been a technical writer

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,409
for 10 years now and I've been working

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,989
in open-source for about five years at

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:45,170
Red Hat I'm a recovering scrum master

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,750
and I still love a July and DevOps I'm

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,760
also on the core team of write the docs

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,560
and if that reminds you of read the docs

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,709
is because it was started by the same

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,030
people so air culture is the co-founder

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,950
and I'm one of the four people who

00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,900
manage the global community I'll tell

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,450
you a little bit about it later

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,819
I was also the participant in the first

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,280
django girls workshop and I ran a few of

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,870
those workshops I organized workshops

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,879
I'm very much in touch with the Python

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,500
and Django communities I'm a member of

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,970
the Django Software Foundation and

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,560
tomorrow afternoon I'm gonna take a

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,599
train to Copenhagen and go to Django con

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,170
Europe so this is my little Scandinavian

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,049
conference tour I contribute to fedora

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,519
I've also done coaching and consulting

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:31,250
for open source projects like KDE NYX OS

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,200
plone all sorts of things and I'm half

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,940
of the team that runs happiness packets

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,400
which has nothing to do with technology

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,200
and everything to do with being nice to

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,579
human beings so you can look it up

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,769
happiness packets do

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:44,780
there are also stickers for right the

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,489
docks and for happiness packets at the

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,310
Red Hat booth so you're welcome to have

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,930
them and what are we going to talk about

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,519
today so doc sorry didn't happen right

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,470
like it's a really nice catchy phrase

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,239
but there are a few things there are

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,060
three parts of this talk that I would

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,950
like to go over first part is content

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,500
strategy is what we write how we write

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,970
it when do we want to write it when you

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,250
plan a little bit you can save a lot of

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,889
time aggravation

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,319
you know effort so we want to be able to

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:13,910
plan things ahead I know sometimes it's

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,590
fun to just jump in there and codes of

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,049
things right but if you want to have

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,150
your project you know scale and be

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,310
sustainable you should be planning your

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,810
documentation as well the second thing I

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,330
want to talk about is DevOps for docs

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,889
and devops is subject it's very close to

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,960
my heart it's all about tooling

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,970
integration and process workflows and

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,070
automation and then the third part is

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,539
about the community spirit because it's

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,669
not just about the tools it's very

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,440
rarely actually about the tools right so

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:41,070
we are surrounded by humans working

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,620
together and

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,590
how we can improve our collaboration

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,870
around this so I would like to invite

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,390
you all to the documentarian Club

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,090
what is the documentarian Club what is a

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,510
documentarian so about five years six

00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,060
years ago right the docs is a

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,980
documentation focused community built on

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,750
open source principles so it was started

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,610
by the folks to read the docs people

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,910
from Django people from Python and it

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,940
was all about holistic approach to all

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,130
kinds of development around the software

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,170
industry all right so a documentarian is

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,030
someone who cares about documentation

00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,850
and communication in the software

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,810
industry regardless of job title so it

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,970
doesn't matter whether you're a

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,280
developer a technical writer support

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,560
engineer community manager DevOps

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,080
everybody has something that they want

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,210
to communicate and we want to achieve a

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,120
certain goal and we need some kind of

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,650
content for it so the principle is that

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,500
you don't have to be a tech writer to

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,830
care and we welcome developers and

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,410
people from all roles in the industry

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,180
into our community so I'll talk a little

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,010
bit about more later so like I said

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,850
everyone is a documentarian

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:57,050
so who here as a primary work job of

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:59,610
developer wait Han okay who here

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,850
interacts officially with documentation

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:06,000
in an active way as a part of their job

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,100
okay mostly the same right so we have a

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,660
lot of people who may not necessarily be

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,580
tech writers but you have to interact

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,930
with documentation how do you deal with

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,070
this right

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,300
so first thing is the content strategy

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,000
asking the right questions ahead of time

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,870
can save a lot of work and time later

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,520
and I'm going to be highly unoriginal

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,160
and used the format of neat to know

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,590
Doc's that's the that's the trick in the

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,090
last few years in the last quite a few

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,920
years where we've gone from

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,550
comprehensive documentation to useful

00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,220
documentation right you don't have to

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,570
document all the things we just just

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,310
tell me what I need to know right now

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,800
and save the rest for later right this

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,270
is something like that so this might

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,900
help you understand a little bit about

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:54,000
the mindset of how maybe technical

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,930
writers think and I definitely invite

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,570
you to ask me and

00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,160
pick my brain about how we think because

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,620
I think there's a lot of interesting

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,370
Skillshare that we can have in our

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,970
communities so I'm going to be highly

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:12,180
unoriginal and use the 5w questions to

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,400
look at how we can plan a little bit of

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,080
our content ahead of time so the first

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,949
question is the biggest question is why

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,960
why the this puts the whole purpose of

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,180
your documentation under the with

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,780
Whitham testa what's in it for me test

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,510
ok so what kind of problem am i trying

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,120
to solve what kind of goal do I want to

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,590
achieve with this software right so I

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,419
get a lot of questions about you know

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,250
how do I document what this tool does

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,010
and like maybe you should be asking

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,620
yourself how do I document what I what

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,240
you can do with my tool not what mic you

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,010
ask not what your tool can do for you

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,449
but what you can do with this tool right

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,669
so if we change that kind of focus

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,910
around then we put ourselves in the

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,400
users shoes for a little bit right so

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,289
why would anybody care about what I'm

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,180
writing why would anybody care about

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,190
what code I'm writing about the software

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,820
that I'm actually pushing out there you

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:08,099
know and sometimes this question can

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,789
actually reveal a different thing

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:14,159
because if I'm documenting for example I

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,710
don't know a couple of dozen workarounds

00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,199
you know for troubleshooting then maybe

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,720
there's actually a problem with the tool

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,190
itself that we need to fix so things

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,870
like that if you keep asking these

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,300
questions why why why until you end up

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,550
at the very core of what you're trying

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,080
to achieve and that's a good that's the

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,450
that's the best start you can haven't

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,459
theoretically you know if you don't have

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,539
time you can probably stop there but

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:41,490
always ask yourself why first okay and

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,580
then the next question I want to ask is

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,040
who who are my readers and that is a

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,310
parallel question - who are my users

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,589
right so persona based documentation is

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,850
quite a common thing that you will see

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,630
so you can ask yourself am i writing for

00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,520
operators am i writing for

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,339
administrators developers business

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,279
analysts whatever it is you know what is

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,250
the level for example of my users am i

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,790
writing for first-time newcomers or am i

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,610
writing for

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,850
very deep dive advanced experienced

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,310
people you can also sometimes split up

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,040
the who question by location because

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,630
sometimes let's say North America versus

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,340
Europe versus Asia they consume

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,770
information people consume information

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,220
in different ways you know so if you

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,480
focus your content to your audience okay

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,760
that's gonna be very useful because

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,470
you're also gonna be able to give them

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,720
the information that they need to know

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,240
and don't confuse them with the stuff

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,160
they don't need to know right the next

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,760
question I want to ask is of course what

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,430
what type of information they are likely

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,810
to be interested in so for example if

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:54,390
it's it could be an installation

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,490
document it could be deployment tutorial

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,980
it could be maybe an architecture

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,600
overview so depending on your audience

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,580
so if I'm writing let's say a white

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,840
paper for solution architects you know

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,420
that I want to have a lot of fancy

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,770
diagrams and things that are going to be

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,660
able they're going to be able to show

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,300
the architecture of the product but if

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,270
I'm writing let's say the first readme

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,640
on your github repo for a small tool to

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,230
be used by you know core developers of

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,930
something then I don't need all this

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,610
fancy stuff I can get right down to how

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,560
do I install how do I use this what's

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,650
the main thing so what type of

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,110
information and at this point you can

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,620
already start snooping around at what

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,500
format of delivery but that's kind of

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,880
like coming up later but depending on

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,320
who your audience is what type of

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,810
information they need to know you can

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,660
see do I need screenshots do I need

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,010
diagrams do I need code examples you

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,360
know all sorts of things like that so

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,600
you can already start thinking about

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,230
that and then the next question is when

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,140
when do my readers need to know this

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,300
information so how much information for

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,910
example do you need to present in an

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,350
error message that's a hard one it's

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,910
it's kind of one of the million dollar

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,040
questions that we're dealing with in the

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,960
documentation world list how much

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,110
information is too much in error

00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,690
messages let's say embedded help you

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,640
know context-sensitive hover tips you

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,710
know the readme of your github repo

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,010
there's a lot of different you know

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,079
where are my user is going to meet

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,820
this content and an error messages

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,040
documentation documentation doesn't have

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,079
to be a book with 500 pages right

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,579
anytime you have written words to

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,740
describe something to do with technology

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:38,459
that's documentation so this is what

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,649
kind of I'm referring to so for example

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,810
if you're writing reference guides it's

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,730
great for searching let's say command

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,920
syntax or functions or stuff like that

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,110
but the users are likely to be

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,089
frustrated by the time that they get

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,910
there so as far as if you're looking at

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,459
software usage cycle so you have day 0

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,290
you know preparation prerequisites

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,990
installation you have day one you know

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,850
installation deployment testing and then

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,680
you have day 2 which is actually using

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,180
the thing and then for example you can

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,279
have troubleshooting right so this is a

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,740
general flow that a lot of the bigger

00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,600
enterprise e documentation sets will

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,540
follow but there's no reason why you

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,820
can't plan it like that even if you know

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,800
day zero day 1 and day 2 are only one

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,930
topic each you know because it'll

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,360
anything that you can do to structure

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,269
your documentation in a way that's going

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,930
to help the users on board every time to

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:32,880
your project is going to be good for you

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:36,329
and it's at this point you can also

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,269
start thinking about content curation

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:41,130
curation meaning maintenance of your

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,860
actual documentation often you do you

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,529
want to update it is it going to be you

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,819
know a synchronous publication or is it

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,380
going to be attached to releases

00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,449
somebody asked me actually yesterday

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,699
over dinner you know should if I'm

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:56,519
storing my documentation in the same

00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:58,680
repository as my code do I need to have

00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,720
them on the same build you know to have

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,569
the code trigger the documentation build

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,279
and I say not necessarily you know if

00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:07,110
it's there in the same repository then

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,240
it can really help you but you don't

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,889
want to have to tie them in because

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,180
sometimes I mean if I want to fix a typo

00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,949
in the documentation I don't need to

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,680
trigger the whole code build for this

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:18,300
and if I'm doing an update in my code

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,040
base that's just on the back end side

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,230
and it doesn't actually change user

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,510
interaction it doesn't trigger a change

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,290
in the documentation necessarily so

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,269
those things are not necessarily

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:33,120
connected what I wanted to say about

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:35,579
this oh yeah how much information do you

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,810
put in a getting started guide ok this

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,040
is another very

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,900
important thing to consider when you're

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,820
asking when do users need to know

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,779
information I'm a big believer that a

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,450
QuickStart guide should be ten or fewer

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:50,640
topics or sections and each one of them

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:55,290
should be scroll free if it's possible

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,910
and anything more than that is would

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,270
wouldn't need to go into a different set

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,460
of documentation okay and the last thing

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,860
that you want to ask yourself is where

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,370
where do I actually deliver this content

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,580
where are my readers likely to consume

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,100
the documentation that I give them so if

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:17,790
you can have do you need a static dock

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:21,330
site you know help dot whatever org is a

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,880
wiki better for you and maybe you want

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,160
just the github readme is enough maybe

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,350
you have man pages maybe you have doc

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,620
strings that are embedded error messages

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,930
every every time you publish content to

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,020
any kind of format that's that where

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,089
question and that's going to affect

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,120
which information you put in so for

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,640
example if I have a project that has a

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,560
documentation page or website okay then

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,870
you can have more user oriented

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,760
information in there but then the

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,880
project also has a readme file in the

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,680
github repo and so you don't need to put

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,690
all of that information in the static

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,260
doc site also in the readme because you

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,650
have different personas coming in there

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,110
at a different time requiring different

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,510
types of information so if I'm an

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,400
operator and I'm looking at the static

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,980
doc sites you know to figure out how to

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,440
troubleshoot something I will naturally

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,750
go there rather than the readme but the

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,820
readme for example will is more likely

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,980
to get hit by contributors developers

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,420
people who need to know different

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,890
information that the users don't need to

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:32,010
know yes so if you keep asking yourself

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:35,010
these questions then you will be able

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,680
hopefully to strategize your Doc's a

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,450
little bit more and save yourself some

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,770
work you know one of the things that I

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,050
hear from developers a lot is Oh

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,459
documentation is a lot of work and yes I

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,959
mean but also coding is a lot of work

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,209
right but you have developed you know

00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,490
developers have gotten a certain skill

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,940
set over the years you know that makes

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,280
you

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,780
right more effectively and so have

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,540
technical writers so if you can use some

00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,610
of the stuff from from our field you

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,370
know and we can all improve our own

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:06,000
skill sets so examples

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:09,510
I love examples I love screenshots sorry

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,040
these are just a few projects and things

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,430
that I've run into over the years that I

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,050
really like I did not include examples

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,450
of things that I don't like because that

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,310
will be a whole other talk and we all

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,110
have horror stories about you know

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,600
broken documentation and bad

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,150
documentation bad documentation or

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,890
outdated documentation is worse than no

00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,780
documentation I will say this now and I

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,060
will stand by it because the time that

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,640
you waste trying to follow outdated or

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,350
wrong documentation is much worse than

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,080
when you're hitting a search and you

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,630
can't find anything so please consider

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,610
this if you run into your own I was at

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,290
the KDE community day yesterday and they

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,910
were talking about the getting started

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,490
documentation and how very quickly they

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,400
ran into outdated material and they're

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,250
not sure whether to fix it right away or

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,080
whether to just open an issue and fix it

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,600
later and I say well have you considered

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,190
hiding or unpublishing you know

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,260
commenting out whatever it is that's

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,270
outdated or maybe even putting a note

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,100
there saying this thing is missing we're

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,740
under construction you know or something

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,170
that was that is going to prove you know

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,209
avoid having the users get confused as

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:19,020
they try to follow this something that's

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:21,930
totally wrong okay

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,420
first example I like to point out is the

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,910
genome help this is from when you go to

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,360
actually the static doc site so help dr.

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,720
org

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,610
I'm not talking about the f1 on the

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
desktop the f1 on the desktop is

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,160
actually kind of cool because it gives

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,230
you the user help topics because if

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,710
you're clicking f1 in your graphical

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,150
desktop then you're more likely to ask a

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,430
question about what it is that you're

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,710
using now so it's in the context of the

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,270
desktop but on the static doc site they

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,610
don't know who you are so the first

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,050
question they ask is what are you okay

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,930
works for Alice in Wonderland and it

00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,450
works here too so if you are a user

00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,980
you're going to get the same help it

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,600
looks a little bit different now but but

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,679
it's basically the same topics this is

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,409
the same help that you would

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,570
if I was to click f1 in my desktop ok

00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:11,549
and then you only get the information

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,070
that's relevant to that if I'm an

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,889
administrator then I get only the

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,110
administrator specific content because

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:21,119
you can assume that if you're an

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,369
administrator you probably already know

00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,259
how to use the desktop and you are not

00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:27,659
likely to have questions about that and

00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,159
if you're a developer then you go to the

00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:30,600
Development Center and then you have all

00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,649
the cool stuff that the developers need

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,940
and you don't even need the

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:35,850
administrative stuff because you have

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,590
are likely to have questions or run into

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,499
trouble with something to do with this

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,450
so if you ask who is the you know and

00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:44,159
because it's a static dock site and it's

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,230
the home page right you don't know who's

00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,799
gonna get there so the first thing that

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:53,879
they do is they focus the persona ok so

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,619
I really like this another example I

00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,749
really like is Arch Linux wiki arch

00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,129
users

00:18:56,749 --> 00:19:00,600
alright that's that's about this you

00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:02,600
know that's a similar ratio to what I

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,090
get normally but Arch Linux is a quite

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,590
very advanced Linux distro I do not use

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,960
this because it is way too crazy for me

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,730
but what I've heard when I was talking

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,029
to people who are Arch users that the

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,129
wiki is fantastic right there we go and

00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,740
why is it fantastic because of this

00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:22,679
thing ok because it doesn't need to look

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,499
sexy you know you don't need to you know

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,809
it looks just like a basic wiki site but

00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,850
it has this little search box and the

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,950
basic assumption is if you're an arch

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,019
user you've tried everything before you

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,110
went here and you are already likely to

00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:40,850
be to know what the more or less the

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,169
search terms that you want to find and

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,360
you're already frustrated and very

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,129
impatient and so you just want to search

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,809
for the thing and this wiki site has a

00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:50,909
pretty good search function so it's

00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,070
optimized for searching rather than

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:57,210
browsing because it knows who the users

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:59,399
are ok this is the next example I used

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,529
to work on a project called mini shifts

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:05,879
mini shift is a localized single node

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,970
containerized open shift installation

00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:10,350
and it's meant for Devon tests and I was

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,299
really lucky to be on the ground floor

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,519
for this we had about a team about 10

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:17,700
people and I was embedded in that team

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,510
as a writer and I'm sorry you can't

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,270
really see

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:24,930
everything that's in this is the readme

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:27,030
for the mini shift github site okay and

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,970
the reason I'm showing this to you is

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:34,260
because it's short okay and this is what

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:36,690
a readme should be short because it's a

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,370
flat file okay even if you have a nice

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,050
table of content in the top which you

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,550
can do this readme is actually written

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,780
in ASCII doc but you can write it in

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:47,190
markdown or whatever it is

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:50,430
github will render this for you but I

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:53,070
have run into so many cases where the

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,990
readme started short and then it got

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,090
longer and longer as the project grew

00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,420
and it just became a dumping ground for

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:03,000
everything you know and if you think

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,040
about the readme of your project as like

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,260
the foyer or the hallway entrance to

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,900
your house you don't want it to be

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,240
cluttered okay especially because we're

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,000
talking about personas the readme is

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,680
likely to be hit by contributors or

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,870
developers or people who want to

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,600
actually do stuff in the project so if

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,640
you treat the readme like a portal that

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,650
will take the people to where they need

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,460
to go so here you have a little welcome

00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,650
statement

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,060
what is this using you know getting

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,160
started we have a link to the

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,960
installation so at this point we already

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,810
have a documentation set and I will use

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,000
it as a different example and we have

00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,980
links to the documentation we have

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,050
release notes and we have the community

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,760
section this is something that a lot of

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,700
projects are missing from their readme

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,890
is how do I contribute okay how do I get

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,170
involved who are the people behind this

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,510
so please make sure you do not forget to

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,520
add a community section in your readme

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,980
because if people are going to your

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,260
github website they are already probably

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,120
familiar with something to do with the

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,370
community but this is a great way to

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,230
engage them and draw them into the

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,370
community as contributors so the next

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,250
thing I want to talk about is we were

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,470
talking about error messages so we had I

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,080
got a draft of an error message from one

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,790
of our developers installing additional

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,040
packages is not supported for more

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,620
information see a link and I'm like okay

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,830
this is not a very useful error message

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,840
and this thing happens when you're

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,460
running a VM and you're trying to

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,500
install packages on the

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,560
file system and there's a size limit

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,900
there and it can actually break your VM

00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,430
so we were trying to figure out how much

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,150
information and this is an error message

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:47,250
that you get in the terminal so you

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,470
can't write too much but you have to

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,300
write something and when I hear when I

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,280
see something that it's not supported

00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,100
it means I'm actually not technically

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,320
allowed something is blocking me but we

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,470
can't block the users from installing

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,910
additional packages so working in open

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,010
source we know people like to break

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,120
stuff and people don't believe us when

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,860
we tell them that something is not

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,830
supported so we have to actually explain

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,180
a little bit why okay so we were trying

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,460
to stop them from doing something

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,810
they're not supposed to do so we have to

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,450
figure out this was a conversation that

00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,560
happened on our github on the issue so

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,810
we have to figure out why this is

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,450
unsupported what are the alternatives

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,820
you know so when you're describing an

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,460
error or a problem you know you cannot

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,100
do this because reason this is what you

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,570
can do instead workaround if one exists

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,600
right so this is something that you

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,440
should be asking yourself as well

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,080
so this is what we came up with

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,000
installing additional packages on the

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,950
root filesystem might exceed the

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,360
allocated overlay size which is

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,710
something that we made the assumptions

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,840
that the people who are using this tool

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,280
they know what an overlay size is I

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,420
didn't know this before but after they

00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,090
explained it to me I was like alright

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,370
this is an assumption we can make and

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,930
lock the mini shift VM proceed with the

00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,520
installation at your own risk which is

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,340
something that Linux people like to say

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,440
so this is kind of a here be dragons you

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,450
know you can do this but we're not

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,930
responsible if you break stuff and then

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,430
we also put in the link to a new

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,670
troubleshooting topic where we actually

00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,160
described the more in more details in

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,800
case they read this and they still don't

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,440
believe us then they can go to the

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,720
website and look at the everything you

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,000
know so we have this is a problem cause

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,210
workaround and if you want to do things

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,710
so we've broken down the information in

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,480
a way that when they see the error

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,130
message in the terminal they only get

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,190
this much information but it is enough

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,960
hopefully for the most part to stop them

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,820
from doing something and if they want

00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,050
more information if they really wanted

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,600
more information they can go and look it

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,010
up somewhere else so this is a

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,179
kind of an exercise and content

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:56,429
breakdown all right DevOps who likes

00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:58,169
DevOps who likes doing them UPS yeah

00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,850
well you know who likes doing

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,100
documentation right I mean who likes

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,980
writing code who likes you know building

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,860
stuff these are all things that are

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,120
necessary in the development cycles so

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,039
one of the cool things that I like about

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
working in open source and working in

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,130
these years okay is that the

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,530
documentation area or field has gotten a

00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:23,190
lot of inspiration and a lot of

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:25,320
integration with the developers and when

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,150
I started working as a technical writer

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,940
10 years ago we were using frame-maker

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,950
which is a very word processing a kind

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,650
of proprietary something-or-another and

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,780
then we went to xml data you know and

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,900
that was really cool and no we don't

00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,370
like xml but these are things that are

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,679
always happening and a lot of the

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:47,190
documentation tooling and process

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,940
innovations are drawing from the

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,590
engineering world first thing I want to

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,990
talk about in there is the integration

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,020
and we would love to not have to beat

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:01,470
you ok we cannot beat you because you're

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,539
right all the tools you know and I'm not

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,280
the most technical technical writer but

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,799
you know I like I said I read a lot of

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,780
Python I can't write it but I can

00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,730
appreciate a good tool if it gets the

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,039
job done and it Red Hat for example we

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,600
have a tooling team that they help us

00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,860
build our tool chain and work all that

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,900
stuff but I've worked in open source

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,150
projects where you have to like do a lot

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,280
of stuff yourself and hitch into the

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,460
system that from the developers that

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,250
you're using so here's an example my

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,929
thing my box moved this box is supposed

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,350
to be right here this is the docs folder

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:37,320
in the mini shift repo so doc says code

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:40,880
love it right there is no reason why we

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,470
shouldn't manage publish curate

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,770
documentation in the same way that we do

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:50,280
the code ok it is no longer a separate

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,470
thing we even use tagged markup files we

00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,350
parse them we compile them we deploy

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,220
them you know a lot of the processes the

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:01,049
tooling chains have aligned so story

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,940
ducks in the same repress your code it's

00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:06,090
also something that's going to help you

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,280
if you are making a code change that

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,390
requires a documentation change I'm

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,360
going to talk about this a little bit

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,220
later in the community spirit part so

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,980
you can put your code change and your

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,320
Doc's change in the same PR and you can

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,480
also you know you can basically leverage

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,340
all of your develop on most of your a

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,309
development tooling and process around

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,830
your documentation and then the other

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:31,980
thing that I really like is to be able

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,500
to do hierarchical source content so in

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,940
this in hopefully you're using this for

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,890
your code as well where you have some

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,510
kind of folder structure where different

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,799
things in your program are grouped in

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:45,059
different ways

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:48,390
so if my this will basically translate

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:50,669
to my table of contents in the doc site

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,770
that I'm building so if I have here you

00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,650
know in it's in this case is quite small

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:58,710
so I don't really have subfolders you

00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,840
know but for example a getting started

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,600
section can have all the topics of

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,250
getting started and you know then you

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,740
have different things and all of each of

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:11,669
these translates into a page on your

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:15,080
static doc site and issue tracking is

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:17,549
something that I'm I really support

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,770
integrating the documentation work into

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:21,990
your issue tracking so make a

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,539
documentation component leak just flag

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:28,230
it you know and then you can see in the

00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:31,380
topics for example you can also mark

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:34,470
things as an easy fix if it's a task if

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,360
it's a bug this is all the same kind of

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,010
philosophy right so these are just

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
examples of the things you can do in

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,880
your open source project right now

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:46,289
without even writing any documentation

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,960
just make it an equal part of the tasks

00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:51,120
that you're doing continuous publication

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,700
I remember when we used to make doc CDs

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,750
that was a nightmare we don't have to do

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,400
that anymore we just push a button

00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:00,750
trigger the Jenkins build and it's done

00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,220
right so there's a lot of different

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,650
tools that you can use to publish

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,539
information if you're writing in Python

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,750
you can use Fink's asciidoctor McDuck's

00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,549
get book you know you can github pages

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,720
will do things for you if you're using

00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,950
git labview use

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,480
whatever it is that you use on a

00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:20,100
self-hosted and you can manage the

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,860
release of your documentation in this

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,440
very similar way to how you do your your

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,970
code continuous deployments this is for

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,100
example from read the docs you know

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,679
every time we merge a PR triggers

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,270
availed updates our website which is

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,370
basically a documentation website

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,030
because we use restructure techs in

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:41,669
Sphinx and we can even have little

00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,890
previews you know staging previews

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,740
before you merge your PR so all that

00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,990
stuff is available and you can

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,440
definitely use it you're welcome to use

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:56,370
it okay so testing automation is hard

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,309
for documentation because pros does not

00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:02,700
compile neatly into binaries okay so

00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,770
this is this is probably the the hardest

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,669
part of what I talked about and the part

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:10,500
that still needs a lot of work there is

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:14,400
work being done around it so I actually

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,990
did so is this the next slide yes okay

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,419
so this is a really cool tool that

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,309
America who you've heard speak there we

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,780
go there he is he told me about this

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,830
yesterday and I was like I have to put

00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,270
this in the talk

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:31,679
it's called shell doc and it is a way to

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:33,390
test commands in a shell code blocks in

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,730
your documentation so this is for

00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,039
example the first part of the readme of

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,380
this project but you can actually run

00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,840
this readme through the tool and it'll

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,789
test these code blocks okay and this is

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,169
the output of the tool so if I

00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,970
understand I just learned about this

00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:50,309
yesterday so but you are totally welcome

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,980
to go and check it out I'm gonna share

00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:54,780
the slides with all the resources so

00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,460
this is for markdown files okay so if

00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,370
you're using restructure text asciidoc

00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,409
xml whatever there are tools for testing

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,090
code blocks okay but this is a really

00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,100
cool solution you know if you have a

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,140
small project you can run it locally you

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,659
can put it into your build sequence and

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,309
it'll literally just validate your code

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,929
blocks so if you want to say you know

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,460
hello and you want to make sure that it

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:16,770
prints hello then it will do that for

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,220
you in a shell so it uses it in voc's a

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,539
shell and then it runs it for you so

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,030
this is a cool new thing that's

00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,470
happening and you know the linguistic

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,490
validation is still a little bit hard

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,300
because when you're writing

00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:31,620
stuff grammar and syntax of the English

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,340
language or whatever language you are

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,050
translating to is also quite difficult

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,340
but this is you know this is one of the

00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,130
cute little tools that we have out there

00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,330
Hemingway app the problem is is that

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,800
there are tools out there that do that

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,080
but a lot of them are not open-source

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,600
and so in the open source communities

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,550
it's still a little bit difficult but in

00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,920
the last few years a lot of tech writers

00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,960
have become a lot more technical so

00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,480
we've been experimenting with a lot of

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,490
different things so there's a push that

00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,830
comes you know motivation that comes

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,290
from the tech writers also to do this

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,020
and because we crossover the skill set

00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,580
between engineering and tech writing

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:12,570
then we are able to do more cool things

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,880
so for example this is called a meander

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,100
this is a test automation framework that

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,170
some of my colleagues at Red Hat content

00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,360
services their tech writers have been

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,150
working on and you basically feed your

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,200
style guide to it you know so things

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,990
like product names things like

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,490
grammatical conventions you know passive

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,030
voice and all sorts of things like that

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:36,210
and it will not fix things for you but

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:38,309
it will uncover problems or questions

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,530
that you might want to optimize that's

00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:43,500
the biggest challenge about about test

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:46,080
automation for for documentation is is

00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,670
it's very hard to do the fixes you know

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,740
so they can just show you I have a

00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:52,320
problem but it's not really gonna help

00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,330
you fix it and a lot of it because of

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,240
the different you know us English UK

00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:59,190
English different languages so this is a

00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,809
cool thing that they're working on now

00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,120
and it might be a little bit overkill

00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:04,770
for your small project but if you're

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,150
looking at scaling your project later

00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,190
and if you actually have a style guide

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:11,150
with conventions then that could be a

00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:13,440
really nice thing that you can do okay

00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,980
mmm I have ten minutes left

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,300
uh-huh so the community spirit

00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,590
I might actually finish a little bit

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:25,290
earlier the community spirit that I talk

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:28,320
about is how we can all work together to

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:30,840
help our users and our contributors our

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,000
community members how to help them help

00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,650
each other and help all of us right so

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,030
we want to do better things we want to

00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:39,240
do more things we want to increase

00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,740
adoption and ultimately all of the

00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,289
awesome gadgets and tools

00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,840
are not going to help us if we don't

00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:48,030
improve our collaboration you know it's

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,100
never really about the tools the tools

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:52,200
we can always make more tools you know

00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,020
and it doesn't matter which tool you use

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,919
because humans end up using it I'm not

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,840
even going to talk about machine

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,990
learning and AI that's let's see let's

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,039
see in five years you know the tools are

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:06,150
not using us yet

00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,580
okay so I don't know what's gonna happen

00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,960
there so in my agile days you know

00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,310
that's what we used to say it's never

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:17,129
about the tools and I still think that

00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:21,869
way so doc Suri didn't happen okay

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:24,540
that's the first thing that that I would

00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:27,720
say if I go to an open source project

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,359
and they ask me how can I improve my

00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,250
documentation is the first thing that I

00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,250
would recommend is to make it a

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,429
requirement okay and I know it sounds a

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,659
bit like oh you're gonna make me write

00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:42,810
documentation and I'm like no I mean I'm

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,510
trying to get you to understand that

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,089
it's just as important to describe what

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,599
it is that you are making because if

00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:54,659
your stuff is not visible if your

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,149
project is just one out of hundreds and

00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:59,250
thousands of projects out there you know

00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:01,230
and in today's world people go online

00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,640
you know you can work with people on the

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,109
other side of the world you never see

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,540
them okay the written word is how you

00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:11,609
rise above the noise okay there's so

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,190
much stuff out there you want to be able

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,780
to engage there's a great talk by a good

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,560
friend of mine Kelly O'Brien called

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,510
engage or die okay and the title is very

00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,300
right you know and she talks about the

00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:27,180
four deaths of engagement you know death

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,250
by disorientation death by confusion you

00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:33,000
know and I actually I'll share this when

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:35,280
I when I shared the slides you know so

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,900
I'm looking at it from in a slightly

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,650
different way doctor I didn't happen

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,030
okay

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,740
I have stickers with this sentence if

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,290
you want to remind your colleagues so

00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,849
you can get those so here are some

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,859
examples of projects that are doing it

00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:49,109
right so if you make documentation

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:51,450
required deliverable when you submit

00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:54,520
patches or Django project Linux kernel

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,609
OpenStack foundation they all require

00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,130
some kind of documentation of course if

00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:01,720
you for example in the linux kernel

00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,609
right it's not required for static

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,740
functions but it's okay there as well

00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:07,599
you know so there's some changes patches

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,430
that you're going to submit that don't

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,339
really need documentation because they

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,619
don't and they don't affect users user

00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:16,869
they don't change behavior right

00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:18,460
but even sometimes if you're making new

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,220
things and you have some duck strings or

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:25,119
code comments let's not forget code

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,880
comments because self documented code is

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,900
code that you wrote recently because in

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,950
six months you're not going to be able

00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,900
to remember what you did

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,000
so that's but that's a more casual form

00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,800
of documentation right like it doesn't

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,190
have to have like stylistic conventions

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:42,220
it just has to kind of be there but you

00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:44,650
know so all of these projects end more

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,510
have started requiring some kind of

00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,240
documentation along with their code

00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,490
patches and it's going to be a tricky to

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,099
get people to get used to it but it's so

00:36:51,490 --> 00:37:01,349
important because you're gonna thank

00:36:54,099 --> 00:37:04,119
yourself later for insisting on it okay

00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:05,800
so you want to make documentation a

00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,050
requirement but you have people who

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,609
might not know how to start or you have

00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,380
developers who've never written a piece

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:13,270
of documentation or you have newcomers

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,820
to your project that you want to

00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,680
encourage them to contribute

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,990
documentation is a great way to get

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,950
people started on your open-source

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:27,849
project okay a lot of projects use

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:30,460
documentation bugs as as easy pickings

00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:34,750
or low-hanging fruit as a way for people

00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:36,790
to practice submitting a patch working

00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,410
in the CI you know working with the

00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,240
community getting familiar with the

00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,849
software getting familiar with the

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,630
projects but you have to help them so

00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:48,130
who will document the the documentarians

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,960
right so who will guard the guards you

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,070
got to help them so this is something we

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,260
came up with for Nix OS most projects

00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:58,690
that I've that I know will have some

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,349
kind of contribution guidelines or some

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,000
kind of help for how to write the help

00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:06,070
so you want to put things like where do

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,370
I find the documentation how do I write

00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,560
the topic

00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,390
so it doesn't matter if your if your

00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,800
project is small you know you should

00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,810
have something in there just like you

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,930
have contribution guidelines for your

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:20,770
code again putting this as an equal

00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:23,540
thing templates templates are awesome

00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:26,660
read the docs write the docs has a

00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,850
readme templates we've had this up there

00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,830
for I think six or seven years and this

00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,380
is probably the page that gets the most

00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:36,080
hits on our website is this readme

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,420
templates and it's so useful because

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,510
it's you just copy and paste it and

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,770
adapt it okay so I talked to someone

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,600
this morning and they said they haven't

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,760
actually written code from scratch in

00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,680
years you know they always take bits and

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,600
pieces you know so we do the same thing

00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,440
in documentation you plagiarize yourself

00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:57,260
all the time so a template can be small

00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,780
for a readme for example or it can also

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,220
be something a little bit bigger which

00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,670
is something that I want to point out

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:08,050
the Red Hat documentation teams have

00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:10,940
been working on two really cool projects

00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:14,600
one is the modular documentation project

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:17,240
and this is for slightly you can use the

00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,030
information from this project even for

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,240
your small project because we have a

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,190
reference guide for example where it

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,160
gives you like lots of different tips

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,200
and tricks on how to write documentation

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,390
how to structure a topic how to

00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,360
structure a documentation repository if

00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,740
you have it you know anchor names file

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,540
names so like people will come up to me

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,700
and go I have this you know project I

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,050
have no documentation I have no idea

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,170
where to start and I've never done this

00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:47,540
before I send them here because they can

00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,460
skim the table of contents and they can

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,900
figure out the stuff that they need and

00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,660
thankfully this was written by writers

00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,310
so we were trying to think of ways to be

00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,890
friendly to newcomers to this field

00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:00,260
right so you can have the reference

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,970
guide you can review it or if you want

00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,730
you could just go to the templates so

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,470
modular documentation is based on topic

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,410
based architecture so you have concept

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,570
procedure and reference which is quite a

00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,610
standard way of writing you know small

00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,110
to big technical documentation and then

00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,580
you have assemblies which is basically

00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:19,100
like a container file with a bunch of

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,900
includes this stuff is an ASCII doc but

00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,650
if for example you go to the

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,930
while this is a procedure raw file and

00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,420
you have tips and comments on things

00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,190
that you can do like you know this is a

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,080
procedure and then you start each each

00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,810
step with an active verb you know do

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,980
this include a command or you know so

00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,130
there's a lot of different things that

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,900
you can use for inspiration even if you

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,850
don't actually use these templates this

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,640
is open source this is public on github

00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:48,650
you please use it the other project that

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,410
we have is the community collaboration

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:54,020
guide so Red Hat sponsors and supports a

00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,240
lot of open source projects and a lot of

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,670
them need documentation help and we also

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,300
then take this documentation hopefully

00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:04,810
sometimes to to our enterprise sites so

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,250
if you have you know if you want to link

00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,080
community or upstream documentation with

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,290
enterprise we have a lot of different

00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:14,930
things here that's more on the community

00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:16,790
documentation management stuff and to

00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,550
see how much documentation you need for

00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,830
your project so the last thing I want to

00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:24,080
talk about is where you can you meet

00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:27,560
people and how can you get together and

00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,690
geek out about documentation and the

00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,050
things that we are with that we want to

00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:35,240
improve right so I want to talk about

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,370
write the docs this is my home this is

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,740
my family it's not an open-source

00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:43,210
project it's a social network okay we

00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:47,030
have five conferences Portland Prague

00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:49,640
Vilnius Cincinnati and Sydney okay and

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,600
we have more than 40 meetups we have a

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,800
slack

00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,260
we have mailing lists we have

00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,600
newsletters and this is the place where

00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,060
I turned up in this conference four

00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,130
years ago and I found my tribe because

00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,380
we have people from all across the board

00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,790
from all over the world we have

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,740
developers we have writers we have

00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:10,130
librarians scientists educators

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:12,230
community managers project manager

00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,810
everybody comes in and we talk about a

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,680
lot of different things and you feel

00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:22,100
free to look it up our CFP is open right

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,570
now for Vilnius and Prague and we have a

00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,280
lot of different ways that you can get

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,990
involved and it's a great learning

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,320
resource as well so we share knowledge

00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:32,900
we learn about cool new things happening

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,880
and we meet great people so and it was

00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,440
built from started on Django and Python

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,319
communities who are also great for

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,839
documentation I want to give a shout out

00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:43,549
to this project because apparently not

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,769
not I mean obviously not everybody knows

00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:47,269
this is a new project from Google I do

00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,950
not work at Google but I love what

00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:52,460
they're doing so if you know Summer of

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:54,289
Code then this is season of ducks and I

00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,910
for some reason I cannot think about

00:42:54,289 --> 00:43:00,440
this name without thinking about the

00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:02,509
rent musical song but season of ducks is

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,740
like Summer of Code but for

00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:05,779
documentation so if you have an

00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,029
open-source project and you need some

00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:10,039
documentation help this is a good chance

00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:12,859
they're opening their applications for

00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:17,839
open source projects are open this month

00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:20,210
and then writers experienced or new can

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,250
look at your project and say oh I want

00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,170
to do something and then you can mentor

00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,849
them and they will do the work over the

00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,130
summer so very similar to Summer of Code

00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,089
except this is for documentation this is

00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,009
the first time that they're doing

00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:32,690
something like this and I'm really happy

00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,400
to see this happening the open source

00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,509
project get some money the writers get

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,440
some money and then you get better

00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:41,059
documentation so good shout out for that

00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,279
and then obviously there are different

00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:45,259
ways that you know we can we can

00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:47,180
interact so for example I am here I'm

00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:49,490

00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,259
Hat booth and I will be available for

00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,599
questions and if you have if you need

00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:54,980
some advice on something or if you're

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,960
not sure you know which markup language

00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,210
should I use for this or you know how do

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,210
