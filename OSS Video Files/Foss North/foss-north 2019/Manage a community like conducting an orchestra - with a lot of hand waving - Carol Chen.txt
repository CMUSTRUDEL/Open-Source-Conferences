Title: Manage a community like conducting an orchestra - with a lot of hand waving - Carol Chen
Publication date: 2019-04-19
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	Have you attended an orchestral performance and wondered what it is exactly that conductors do besides waving their arms in the air? Most of the value that the conductor (community manager) brings to the orchestra (community) is carried out before the performance (behind the scenes). In this session, I will share my experiences in orchestras and open source communities big and small across different countries. How do you take care of the different types of contributors/players and bring out their best? What happens when they have differences in opinion on how to collaborate? How do you make the community welcoming and inclusive especially for people with different backgrounds and who may not speak your (programming) language? Join me on a musical journey through some of the common (and perhaps not so common) dissonances of community orchestration and their possible resolutions!

all right so hi everyone thanks for

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,619
coming to my talk I'm Carol and when you

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,000
asked me what I could do my talk in 15

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,029
minutes I just said yes we don't

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,099
thinking about it so but now you looked

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,470
at maybe I was like 17 minutes so let's

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,329
see what we can do with this and I've

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,720
worked my heart rate up to like 90 BPM

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:43,649
so I'm keeping pace all right let's go

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,660
so about me I wanted to cut the crap so

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,300
I just wanted to say I'm Carol Chen you

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,830
can find me a side bet almost yeah

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,790
social media like Twitter Facebook

00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,310
diaspora somewhere

00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,800
Oh github of course and even freenode

00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,580
IRC so if you want to know more about me

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,500
just connect with me there and I'm going

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,520
to talk it be talking about community

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,560
management and conducting and I'm going

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,930
to do it in cut common time which is a

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,619
symbol right there if those of you whom

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,630
know music

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,540
knows that you usually used for

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,060
something with a faster tempo so that's

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,850
where I'm going with right now so my

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,380
favorite letter is C for some strange

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,130
reason so alright so what does a

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,630
community manager or conductor do and

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,630
what are the similarities between them

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,689
that's what you usually see like a

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,759
conductor in front of an orchestra he

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,560
seems to be waving he sounds around the

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,200
magic happens a music comes from the

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,439
players and everything goes cool and

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,240
nice and even the conductor might be

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,350
thinking I'm just you know waving my

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,679
arms waved us take whatever and these

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,719
are some of the sources for the graphics

00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:06,829
okay by a show of hands full place in

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,170
the ensemble an orchestra or something

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,990
no one Wow okay who is the community

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,170
manager or does something similar okay

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,950
all right why are you in this talk just

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,840
kidding

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,990
I'm glad you're here maybe you'll learn

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:27,320
something I hope so what about community

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,490
manager is some I guess possible

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,320
scenarios you think like

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,450
it's easy when you say I'm an engineer

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,640
and okay you write code I'm a designer

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,590
okay you made everything look pretty you

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,930
know I'm a technical writer oh you write

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,540
the talks or even marketing manager are

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,480
you promote the products commitment I'm

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,980
a community manager okay you are what is

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,250
it that you do again I got this source

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,770
from this Flickr account but actually

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,100
it's so since flickers going away it's

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,720
not the link is not working anymore so

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,480
it might be available in wayback machine

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,190
or something so I hope to I don't know

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,470
who the original author is yes so I

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,500
think most of the value that a community

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,040
manager or a conductor brings to the

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,350
community or the orchestra it's a lot of

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,610
times on seeing like it's behind the

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,690
scenes it's before the performance is

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,900
you know something that's not readily

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,290
visible and some of these stereotypes

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,840
that you see in the previous slides

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:37,080
doesn't tell the full story I was in

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,290
Singapore

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,680
just last month and had a chance to go

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,720
to an open rehearsal of the orchestra

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
with Andrew Leighton who is currently

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,330
the guest conductor in Singapore

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,410
Symphony and actually the the

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,440
coincidence is that when I was living in

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,510
Dallas he was the main conductor for the

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,010
Dallas Symphony Orchestra so it's nice

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,010
to see him again with a different stiff

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,620
in the orchestra and see how he how the

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,430
dynamics is him with another different

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,230
orchestra and so yeah because the main

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,630
concert was sold out I went to the open

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,090
rehearsal which is actually more of what

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm interested in I like to see what I

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,799
mean I know the piece I like to see you

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,660
like what are the things they work

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,720
through more because it's more

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,700
challenging or you know because they

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,890
have a soul always food don't usually

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,540
pay for the orchestra so it could be

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,660
something like an external contributor

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,000
to a community project to a project that

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,220
may not be used to the dynamics of the

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,160
community of the main group of

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,690
developers for example so you know what

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,210
what they talk about what they discuss

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,520
this

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,139
actually sometimes because you don't see

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,260
that at a performance but that's

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,780
actually how they make the piece sound

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,300
really good and how they how a community

00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:05,740
manager might do to make the project

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:10,090
more successful so what what does okay

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:13,750
before that as solo is like for example

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,130
this violin is his name is ragin when

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,990
he's placed by himself he probably

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,930
doesn't need a conductor when there's a

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,900
small group of developers working our

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,760
project probably they don't need full

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,340
and they'll community manager full-time

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,450
or something because when you start

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:34,810
small the need for that may not be

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:37,479
immediately apparent but as the

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,270
community grows when you have you know

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,340
people different groups doing different

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:47,139
things like testing translations

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,479
documentation and so on you need some

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,340
kind of a coordination especially when

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,050
you involve external contributors or

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,350
contributors from different backgrounds

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,539
so I think in the same way a conductor

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,470
brings together where you have different

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:05,979
players you know a Valene section my

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,229
play wonderfully by themselves but you

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:10,419
know combine them with the trumpets you

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:13,060
know you need to balance them and you

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,520
need to make sure in certain sections

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,340
maybe the trumpet should shine more and

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,560
in other sections you know the oboe or

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,330
something should come up more in the

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,389
same way in the project you know there

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,970
are times for development ways more

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,789
focused and at a certain time you know

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,020
the testing is more important and

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:35,020
towards the end maybe you bring in

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:41,380
marketing and communication and things

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:44,139
like that to promote the project so what

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:48,300
is it that makes perhaps a good

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:51,849
conductor or good community manager a

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,740
conductor usually well you can't expect

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,880
a conductor to know how to play every

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,300
single instrument well

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,610
they usually are they might mastering

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,800
one instrument for example and relating

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,660
the one in the previous picture he's

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,730
actually a very accomplished pianist and

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:14,090
the conductor of the orchestra I'm

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:18,650
playing in he's a professional volume

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,450
play in another Orchestra so similarly a

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,910
community manager may have different

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,130
backgrounds I personally I have been a

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,530
software engineer in Nokia previously

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,780
for eight and a half years but there are

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:34,430
community managers from marketing

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:38,210
background documentation and design or

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,160
you know some other related areas so is

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,790
there a skill set that is like a

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,060
necessary thing for Community Managers I

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,360
think it's good to have some of some

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,520
knowledge of everything like I I do know

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,010
a bit of web design that can help to

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,810
maintain the website for our project I

00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,170
know enough about marketing and SEO to

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,910
[Music]

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:05,390
make the blog post and social media and

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,890
make that happen but um I don't think

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,940
any single one of them is like

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,940
absolutely necessary

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,340
so as a conductor studies the whole

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,380
score to know what each part is playing

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,620
what where what what is important that

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,830
which parts the community manager knows

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,190
different functions and different

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:31,070
contributors who is doing what and I get

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:35,180
to work with my our engineering team and

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:38,270
also testing team as well as external

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,760
contributors from the community and not

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,420
just that also like people who helped

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,430
plan meetups and events like this from

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,460
different areas they are part of the

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:53,440
community as well and I actually a lot

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:58,100
of my contacts are these event planners

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,980
who are in the community so how do you

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,140
take this all this different type of

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:07,580
contributors and players and what's so

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,140
on and bring out the best in them by

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,680
listening and knowing their strengths

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,730
and

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,189
sometimes witnesses so if you know who

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,449
does what well you can put them in the

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:24,199
proper kind of tasks for example I know

00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:26,869
some people in my in my teams the teams

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,749
I work with they like to do

00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:32,569
presentations so I can enlist their help

00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:36,499
in different events to speak or you know

00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:39,139
if there are certain some certain topic

00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:42,860
experts that you know they can help with

00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:43,910
and some people with different language

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,589
abilities they can help with

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:50,689
translations listen for balance you

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,209
can't have just like in the orchestra

00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:55,189
just strings and nothing else well

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,839
unless you're a string orchestra but you

00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,629
know you just can't have first fallings

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,029
and no channel for example so that there

00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:04,670
needs to be a balance even the best

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,709
technical product unique good UX design

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,399
to make it usable you need good

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:12,559
documentation like my colleague Mikey

00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,170
talked about this morning and also

00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,240
marketing to promote it and make it

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:22,819
bring awareness to the product in a

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:25,540
project so as my time is a bit more

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:28,279
limited I could go more in depth to

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,910
about you know how to listen what to

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,620
listen for

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,059
but maybe I'll save that for another

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,589
talk in the next one or perhaps actually

00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:40,839
I will prefer maybe to see as a

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:43,790
discussion to hear about what people

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,759
ideas and opinions are because I like to

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:51,829
listen as well so maybe let's make that

00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:53,929
happen but um if you don't listen and

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:55,879
understand and identify the real

00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:58,910
problems in the first place all the

00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:02,509
tools and tips won't be able to fix the

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:06,049
problem so it's always good to start

00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:08,149
with the listening part so my previous

00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,959
slide said jack of all trades but master

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:11,779
of none

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,399
now I take that back I think a good

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:17,420
community manager should be a master of

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,920
listening and if I had like a two or

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,199
three minute lightning talk I'll just

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,580
throw this light up and say listen

00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:25,440
although you won't have the context

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,780
leading up to it so he might not be

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,480
asked interesting but yeah this other

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,600
conductor is I was listening to bring

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,880
balance and kind of dynamics the whole

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,340
piece so a good community manager I'm

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,180
constantly listening hopefully I'm doing

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:44,970
that to see who needs what Wow

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,100
how can certain other groups help with

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,800
you know different groups how to make

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,900
connections and if that's the

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,100
disagreement if I try to find common

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:59,970
ground and resolve make resolutions and

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,460
then communicate while still listening

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,140
because it's always a two-way thing it's

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,830
not enough that I just listen I need to

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:11,840
be able to take what I listen and make

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:17,370
the change make solve the problem so

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:19,770
that's that and in a one of the top

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,170
orchestras you you hear you see a you

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,000
know good conductor who probably is

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,950
really good at listening and bring the

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,380
best out of the orchestra but I think

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,230
the players musicians also have a job

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,910
that they can help by listening while

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,130
playing because their main focus is

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,750
still playing and making the music but

00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,090
by listening to their fellow players

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,550
they can help the conductor in a way to

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,400
achieve the balance and similarly you

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,890
know I have I love it when my my

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,610
co-workers and community members help

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:53,070
with by listening themselves to bring

00:12:50,610 --> 00:13:00,390
more harmony and collaboration within

00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:02,940
the community and maybe it's a bit

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,480
different for talking about musicians of

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,920
course you need a good hearing to be

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,630
able to listen but when I talk about

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,710
listening in terms of community

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,970
management you can I mean I'm not trying

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,460
to exclude people who are actually

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,190
physically hard-of-hearing because when

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,170
one is more about being aware you can

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,570
definitely some of your eyes checking

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:28,560
out forums are see channels what's being

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:31,920
discussed who has given feedback and you

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,710
know take that as input so it's not just

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,360
all your input but also visual tags

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,700
whatever

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:46,680
the communication channels for your

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:49,200
project and and sometimes you notice you

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,120
know when the orchestra is playing on

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,839
stage and the conductor is waving the

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,899
arms around

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,740
nobody's looking at the conductor

00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,480
especially the players they seem to be

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,420
like you know very involved in whatever

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,990
instrument they're playing but actually

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,690
most of us well I was hoping some people

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,270
have been playing musicians playing in

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,520
the orchestra before but actually we do

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,110
tend to look at the conductor from

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,029
occasionally from the corner of our eye

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,440
or something

00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,779
we are aware of the presence of the

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,899
conductor but the thing is once you have

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:24,390
worked closely with the conductor you

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,130
you know his kind of rhythm he saw her

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,620
kind of rhythm you don't need to be

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,560
staring at him or her all the time same

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,920
thing of a community manager you know it

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,120
doesn't mean though I do you know

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,279
sometimes be in front of people and

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,350
promote stuff abuse and events and

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,350
things like that but it's not about me

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,649
be visible I'm really promoting the

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,990
project and the people who worked on it

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:52,529
and they all work their effort and the

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,200
result of that to the audience so the

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,450
community manager is actually a link

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,399
between the orchestra and the audience I

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,630
mean the conductor is the link between

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,610
the orchestra the audience

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,579
similarly the community manager is the

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,950
link between the project and the you

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:11,339
perhaps the users of the project so you

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:13,320
take cues from the audience can look at

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,310
the conductor sometimes and beyond be

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,649
able to understand what's coming up or

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,959
which sections to pay attention to so

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,540
for example this new release you know

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:29,970
that they go to an event and spread

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:35,510
awareness about it and so that's part of

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:37,800
the job and and definitely you know as a

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,800
symphony or some kind of an orchestral

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,350
work there's no one way to play it so

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,850
it's similarly different conductors may

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,150
have slightly different interpretations

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,079
of that work and I would encourage

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,100
community managers to have your own

00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,720
personality

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,180
doesn't mean that you have to do a

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,620
certain thing only a certain way but you

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:01,440
know bring your personality into the

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,709
project and I think oh yes of course we

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,769
have a redhead booth here at fast North

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:09,180
this is my third time here and first

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,709
time two years ago I talked about many

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,139
choke you and actually some of you

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:16,440
remember that so thank you and first

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:19,440
time having a booth so hopefully we'll

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,990
continue that next time that's actually

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,810
Theresa who is at the booth and Andres

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,329
who was while doing usability surveys if

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,139
you interested there's a documentation

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:32,910
help desk with Mikey who gave the

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:35,970
documentation talked earlier and also

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,509
just general awesomeness and more

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,500
stickers to add to your collection

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:55,519
that's it thank you very much for

00:16:40,500 --> 00:17:04,169
listening we have time for one question

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:07,620
and I see one question do you think it

00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:09,209
makes a difference I'm not saying it

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,409
doesn't do you think it makes difference

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:15,659
whether the community manager is

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:18,140
appointed by the company that developed

00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:21,780
something or emerges from the community

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:24,659
so whether it matters if the community

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:31,820
manager was a member of that specific

00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:34,860
community before or not I think okay I

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,080
think there is a difference but I think

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,169
the most important thing is for the

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,940
community manager to have belief and

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,530
passion in the project for example

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,270
previously in Yola

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:50,580
I was kind of the appointed committee

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:52,230
manager but when I left Yolo James who

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,020
is sitting right here who is the my

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,730
successor he himself has been part of

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,220
the community for a long time and now

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,169
he's the community manager and we

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,940
thought we do bring different kind of

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:06,790
aspect to the community but I think

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,290
you know we can both do a good job to be

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,210
the community together because we're

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:15,190
both passionate about what we're doing

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,170
thank you thank you feel free to go to

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:22,539
the Red Roof and talk to me more

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,539
[Applause]
