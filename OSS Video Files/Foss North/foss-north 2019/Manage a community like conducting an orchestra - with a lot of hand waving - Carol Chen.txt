Title: Manage a community like conducting an orchestra - with a lot of hand waving - Carol Chen

Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	Have you attended an orchestral performance and wondered what it is exactly that conductors do besides waving their arms in the air? Most of the value that the conductor (community manager) brings to the orchestra (community) is carried out before the performance (behind the scenes). In this session, I will share my experiences in orchestras and open source communities big and small across different countries. How do you take care of the different types of contributors/players and bring out their best? What happens when they have differences in opinion on how to collaborate? How do you make the community welcoming and inclusive especially for people with different backgrounds and who may not speak your (programming) language? Join me on a musical journey through some of the common (and perhaps not so common) dissonances of community orchestration and their possible resolutions!
