but if you still can't let me know

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,000
without your daughter so let's start

00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,310
with who

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,370
my name is a channel as you can see in

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,090
the channel it's correctly read where I

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,370
live in Germany they keep ordering my

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,550
name on their own because Ali can't be a

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:46,110
last name so I think yeah a lot of fun

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:49,210
there when I work for redhead since

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,880
February but I worked for redhead for

00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,650
five years before and then I left and I

00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,940
regret it living leaving it but I

00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:01,450
finally found a way to get back so most

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,540
of my background is in us or last 19

00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,149
years now I've been working at the

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,240
different kind of software I am all

00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:12,479
about free software and open source

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,899
besides that I'm going to flying and I

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:21,070
captain I love cats

00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:22,780
so I'll tell you a story and its present

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:28,870
but since you're here you might as well

00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:33,490
listen I'll try to be funny so it starts

00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,409
in 2007 when in Finland some people were

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,100
bored and they were having beers as they

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:41,560
do and the sound or something and the

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,720
one of them was this guy and the other

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,060
one was this guy you might have noticed

00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,010
some common thing in these two pictures

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,450
they are both into fine as am I so

00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,600
something to do with flying and a

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,040
connection with Finland and whatever

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,280
people start thinking about what about

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,130
there if we can locate people from

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,650
contexts proprietary one has already

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,070
been doing that so today I think that

00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,660
this was about the time when the

00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,180
proprietary phones and stuff they

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,550
started really doing very well for in

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,240
terms of locating where people are and

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:23,330
this is something missing in open-source

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,280
so they thought of something called that

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,440
they decided that we should have like a

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,510
tea bus service device was also new at

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,580
that time but every all new services on

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,860
the desktop stuff at least for deeper

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,930
space so they thought they should have a

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,660
lower geolocation service geolocation

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,350
means to locate very what if you didn't

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:45,620
know and then so they came up with the

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,090
idea and there were some Guardian people

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,370
involved as well and they wanted to use

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,170
it to their product and these two guys I

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,510
had showed you they were both they're

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,820
both involved they were involved in my

00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:00,230
mind be go if you talk about that and in

00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:02,960
Nokia so to clue was born that was the

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,500
name given to the project location he

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,150
was serviced and those two guys they

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,190
were too busy the one of them is not a

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,140
coder and the other one was a coder he

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:17,540
does a lot of things so then he did you

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,180
know someone to to do tension work and

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,870
this guy showed up also fulfilling and

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,530
he did he was at Summer of Code student

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:34,160
so he did implementation of geo clue

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:35,780
sorry in a sock project and he did like

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,500
a lot of work in a very small amount of

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,480
time

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,760
pretty good for first-ever

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,920
implementation geolocation

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,290
implementation and he was service of its

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:51,500
kind and the concept was based on

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,910
external providers in those days like a

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,670
lot of these deeper services they were

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,220
designed to be very modular and so they

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,670
went with

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,530
approach so the main service did not

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,080
implement any sources if they didn't

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,930
that it had no solution for how to

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,760
actually locate you and the actual

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,710
location was provided by external

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,990
sources external providers and there

00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:16,459
were some implemented and it is part of

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:22,650
the service but mostly by other people

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:25,860
as part of my platform mainly it mainly

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,110
in the open source born without any if

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,820
you get a product and the people who

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,190
have a Geo based product they would

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,810
integrate their proprietary services

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,970
with it and you have much better

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,510
communication but in the open source in

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,060
the upstream world you had only two main

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,750
sources one was the typ which is the

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,450
simplest source of how to find people

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,970
and at all it kind of always works in a

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,550
sense that everyone who is connected to

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,530
Internet has an IP so there is at least

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,560
a way to find your location

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,910
didn't that VIP might not be you know

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,320
you might not be able to locate where

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,090
that IP is but at least you can IP

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:09,240
something to go on and another thing was

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,060
Wi-Fi ways your location but not really

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,310
it wasn't a good solution but what they

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,030
have was like in some file you yourself

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,430
can add the Wi-Fi networks and the

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,440
location where it is so then you end up

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,680
with a configuration database where you

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,050
have all these Wi-Fi swear they are but

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,940
that was like a personal thing and only

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,010
advanced users could handle that so it

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:37,260
wasn't really a Wi-Fi education source

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:39,360
but kind of that they also kind of

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,570
co-created another project called gypsy

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,940
for being able to utilize standalone GPS

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:49,470
devices the one you

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,300
- Bluetooth and USB the thing is like

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,470
there was already something called GPS T

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,790
which has existed for much longer but

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:04,590
Allah say anything about the maintainer

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:08,550
being horrible but you can find out who

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,220
it is probably but it was also because

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,650
the GPS D had a very conservative

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,760
architecture it comes from the UNIX all

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,340
UNIX days where like you don't do any

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,020
kind of memory allocations and so I put

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,480
a lot of restrictions on what they use

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,760
and also they didn't want UT bus because

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,110
that was too new and cool for them so

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,750
they came up with this gypsy project for

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:37,260
for handling GPS devices and it was a

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,910
put separate from geo clue because this

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,440
standard on GPS devices typically

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,180
requires some configuration and that

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,900
qualification couldn't be part of cube

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:50,910
glue it didn't work out at the box and I

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,680
also had an archaic IPC as I said that

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,780
they want they want to do T bus so they

00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:02,760
did some own IPC mechanism strange

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,169
anyway so - you got all of it and there

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,640
was a dream that people were excited

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:11,250
about it and they were Garmin and Milo

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,900
devices already than using it so it was

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,110
already also in products but then over

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,460
time the dreams got forgotten and

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,830
whoever happened she was your clue they

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,630
just kept not using it our impose

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,000
whether it was broken or not they just

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,550
kept on going with it and the people who

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,840
were behind the geo clue building and

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,330
envisioning it

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,330
they had other things to do

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:41,989
until 2013 when I got bored with I

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:47,819
talked to this guy he's involved he

00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,349
worked for Red Hat and at that time he

00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,079
was the same group as me in the desktop

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,819
team and he's involved in a lot of

00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,239
different open-source project he does a

00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:00,479
lot I don't know how he lives because he

00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:02,939
does too much coke so yeah I talked to

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,300
him and he said yeah I have this yo clue

00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,879
new idea for you clue so you can do the

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,399
implementation I have the design already

00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:14,639
that's agreed to that and geotube was

00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,899
born it's a complete rewrite of clue I

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,279
didn't know anyone want to look at the

00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,139
whole code because that was really

00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,639
showing its age each time I looked at it

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,279
I just didn't understand what was going

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,259
on it was using my old libraries that

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,389
were not maintained anymore and stuff so

00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:33,860
I thought it it just best if I start

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:37,729
from scratch using modern tech system

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,889
it was designed to be simple

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,479
architecture so for example we didn't

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,459
have external sources but internal

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,199
sources only so everything lives in the

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,899
same repository if you want to have some

00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:50,759
source come and talk to us some bad

00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,709
patches we are more than happy to have

00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,870
more and more sources to the upstream

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,600
geo group and it also grows on a project

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,040
that way because with the previous

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,779
approach people are having their own

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,939
proprietary solutions and they didn't

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,470
bother to contribute upstream because

00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:07,559
they have no reason to

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:12,660
but this give them more therefore the

00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:14,600
more to also the there's this thing

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,509
called geocoding is a process of

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,180
translating a screen to to a location or

00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:21,570
certifications and reverse geocoding is

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,380
the

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,029
like you you get a location and you can

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,000
find out where the application is well

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:32,339
what's the name or something and that

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,440
was part of previous you clue but this

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,410
was separated out into another library I

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,470
helped create this library actually and

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,300
the excuses nomina than the

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,430
OpenStreetMaps database for for doing

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:51,079
its work but it was done for separately

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,079
and and we wanted to have already

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,550
conspiracy concerns because your

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,610
location is one of the most sensitive

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,220
data you have on devices you don't want

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,610
it to be given to a nanny app you don't

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:09,959
trust so it would be nice to have that

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:12,060
control and so we came up with the idea

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,440
of after position they did actually it

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:19,050
was passed yet I could take some chatted

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,180
and we at least I promoted it for grown

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,000
which I cared about at that time fully

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,639
and other people like elementary people

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,220
they for their operating system so it's

00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,279
a it's an agent that that is part of

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,990
your desktop and it is responsible for

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,630
authorizing district naps like when you

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,029
glue gets request from an app like I

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,550
want your the location it tells us which

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,910
what kind of location city level or

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:49,470
street level of whichever precision and

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:52,949
it agent whatever item is installed i

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,019
dis user for this user and for this app

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:57,300
can I access location for this accuracy

00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,560
and the agent can say in answer yes

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,560
Roger

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,100
so yeah so there was some privacy

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,790
control finally and there was you I for

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,860
controlling it and of course you can't

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,500
have a geolocation service without any

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,620
sources how would you find where you are

00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,240
there's different ways first the easy

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,100
ones to go with GIP there's a like

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,560
database called

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,589
it's from a company called X mind and

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,940
that's the most used do IP database

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,440
without there there's a commercial

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,420
version and there's non commercial

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,459
version there's not a lot of difference

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,230
between them there is some that the

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,319
commercial is a bit more up-to-date and

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,540
accurate but it's still GIP in general

00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:45,600
is not very accurate you can address

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:52,709
city level location if you're very lucky

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:55,050
maybe district level and GPS a level

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,699
what else so there's a modem there's two

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:01,380
different kinds of modem services the

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:05,130
one I went for is modem editor and it

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,360
it's simple why you get just access the

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,550
GPS from there you don't have to

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,730
configure the GPS as I was saying in the

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,949
standalone case you have to configure it

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:18,000
but in these cases you don't just access

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:20,490
them GPS but the problem is that these

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,240
modems how many devices have it like

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,980
desktop machines don't have it at least

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,699
laptops some laptop started having these

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:35,310
but they were disabled to remove so it

00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:37,889
it wasn't that reliable and then we have

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,959
the challenging ones with the first one

00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,899
and it's also the most effective ones

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:46,160
nearly all devices except for desktops

00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:49,019
have Wi-Fi so I don't make use of that

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,209
and as I mentioned they would have so

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,800
you've modern also of course it is for

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:56,430
seminar way so you can connect a

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,040
cellular the cellular gives you an

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:06,420
accuracy of up till some kilometers a

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,110
kilometer at best but but Wi-Fi gives

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,209
you street level

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,490
Gok location and that's really really

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:13,850
good and it doesn't require a special

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,850
hardware

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,890
so we went for Yahoo step through a

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,710
database first for 4G Wi-Fi because

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,990
Wi-Fi the way it works is that you asked

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,270
like I see these networks where am I

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,710
like from a server and where does this

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,990
server come from but you have to have

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,390
some database somewhere and yahoo had

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,820
when almost opened but then it wasn't I

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,310
think it was closed so we were out of

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,280
ideas but then one seller came and we

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,370
had like a good solution because they

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,380
utilize their user base all across the

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,110
world who were really eager to provide

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,740
the data of different pipelines all

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,790
around the world

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,290
so they have a really huge younger

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:57,700
brother number amount of data now and

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,170
you get a really good location from for

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,090
desktop machines we had one more

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,090
solution that first we could come up

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:08,230
with we have an app for Android that you

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:11,710
can just transfer the GPS data which is

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:15,040
called an NBA format you know or TCP and

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,960
it uses the body to do the announcement

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,250
that I'm here on the network on the same

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,010
network as the desktop or whatever

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,900
machine and machine running joke whether

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,140
it's laptop or desktop picks it up and

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,720
then it gets a very accurate the GPS

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,250
based location from your from your phone

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,530
if they are on the same network

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:38,110
standalone GPS devices we don't have a

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:41,350
good solution GTV gypsy was almost gone

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,140
and some maintained for many years the

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,610
same thing was with the Geo Bruce source

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,500
code that you just didn't want to touch

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,970
it right or so hold that nope nobody

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,650
even the maintainers are gone so they

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,830
don't they can't answer your questions

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:56,560
so we came up with a new software called

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,020
GPS share which I have got an interest

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,950
talk more about that but it finally you

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,180
have five minutes left and but but the

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,310
rest of the language that

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,360
so my reliable is designed to be very

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:16,390
reliable and very safe language and also

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:19,360
a very efficient so I deserve it just as

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:26,140
a manager what mode am sorry GPS system

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:28,120
GPS device okay and we from beginning we

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,320
had no mitigation because I was working

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,910
with you know we have I wrote co-wrote a

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,459
software called Maps program and that

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,589
uses geolocation I also have implemented

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:41,560
automatic time zone updated good on was

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:45,040
based on this toxin weather uses it

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,250
WebKit GT cages and more but more

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,600
recently we we moved from bugzilla to

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:54,690
get lab that was a huge win because we

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,520
have got a lot more contributors now

00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,399
contributing writer that is it became so

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,070
easy to contribute rhino patches it's

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,120
discipline with Bugzilla that wasn't the

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:10,450
kids but now there's also flat back so

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,160
we are changing how I won't go into

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,680
detail about what flat pack is I don't

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,020
have time but you can search it is it

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,910
it's abundant handling and sandbox and

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:24,700
solution so we drop have authorization

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,670
for system apps because we cannot

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,800
identify system helps my system apps I

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:33,250
mean I'm running natively on your

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,440
machine without the sandbox and there's

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,940
just no way on Linux so we were just

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,350
kind of pretending that we're giving you

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:44,440
privacy but we were in reality we were

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,860
doing real security privacy because any

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,769
nap can pretend to be an agent or

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:55,000
we just don't have no way so the only

00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:58,329
way to do a cheap true privacy's through

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,220
Sam Sann boxing so we gave up on

00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:05,290
advertising for system apps it's only

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,540
for sandbox applications now there's

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,280
some challenges ahead what's the

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,770
location service since you know motel

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,740
has not gone over into mobile and stuff

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,240
like that so they have no reason to keep

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,770
developing the location service or

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,049
maintain it and I think they're giving

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:24,040
light on the running the service the

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:25,780
instance we can still use it but all the

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,819
bugs they won't be ever fixed because

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,559
there is no developer working on it so

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,860
that's a really good risk for our open

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,299
source your location right now and I

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,760
would really love some other

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,280
organization to take over this this role

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,799
and if they if you're using especially

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,410
geolocation I think one of them would be

00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,210
could be good on foundation but that's

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,809
why I wanted Neal to be in my talk but

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,429
he's not listening to me welcome and

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,370
yeah that would be really cool if a

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:58,020
foundation or some other and open source

00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:02,080
organization can help us out with this

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,210
big problem because if there is a Wi-Fi

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,450
tier location it just wouldn't work

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,929
that's the best thing we have for

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,030
geolocation right now in open source we

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,980
want more platforms your lie still using

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,020
the old geo glue and maintained there's

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,620
a lot of other platforms ever tasted

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,150
using one month would be cool if they

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,830
port with a new one and report any

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,679
issues that they have and I'll try my

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,380
best resolving more attributes are

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,000
needed please and just one guy and I'm

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,419
doing it on my spare time which I don't

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,660
have a lot of also I intend to rewrite

00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,520
the service for us over the years it's

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,679
written in C

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,990
dimensional view group that you as well

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:49,860
and I wanna see many many crash reports

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:54,270
I'm not a Banksy programmer and still

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:56,730
and I keep learning every day to do see

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,730
better more safer but still I'm a human

00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,360
being and I build make mistakes and

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,920
anyone who will work on this bill so I

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,790
want to rewrite the service part of the

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,260
court that's the core interest and

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,270
fortunately there is a lot of people in

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,240
outreach e and google Summer of Code

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,520
that are interested to work on that so

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,350
I'm I'm hoping that if by the end of the

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,590
summer we will have the service code

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,650
rewritten it was I did you want to work

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:31,410
on that please please come and talk to

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:34,130
me but that's it I don't know if you

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:42,240
want to go for teets already tablet

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:47,929
questions too and he has one at the far

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,929
back of course it has to be spent

00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:10,660
I was something if provided if you know

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,140
anything about it I guess it's up to

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:17,350
them they need to come forward I can ask

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,880
them of course but I don't know they

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,550
they already have their hands full with

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,820
what they're doing so it seems a bit

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,130
unlikely but you know so if you if you

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,260
want to ask for me and I might forget

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,970
I'm already forget forgetful person so

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:35,260
that would be awesome and let me know if

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:37,600
they say yes yeah I'm curious how

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,850
feasible it would be to have a finding

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,340
based on its Wi-Fi access points I mean

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,280
I don't know the scale of things are

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,100
really prevalent now anyway and we have

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,260
huge storage so more mobile phones etc

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:54,070
so maybe we don't you need a phone line

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,690
service for those yeah you're talking

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,390
more about caching and that would be

00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,950
really cool to do is you and I want I

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,380
would like to do that

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:07,050
it just says they're just about someone

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:09,430
doing it that would be very much to do

00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:15,190
and okay then you're right it would be

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:20,350
really really good to have that I don't

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:24,000
dare to run down the stairs so how do

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,650
you do time so look up from Geo position

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,860
you find out where you are and then you

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:32,290
have there's a database of like

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,140
coordinates like tracking numbers and

00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:38,710
from a street map or when you get that

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:41,670
database I think it's their own custom

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,670
element

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:53,420
any more questions otherwise I propose

00:21:51,640 --> 00:22:00,369
we give it began

00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:00,369
[Applause]

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,410
