Title: Flourishing FLOSS: Making Your Project Successful - Anna Ossowski
Publication date: 2019-04-18
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	You maintain an Open Source project with great code? Yet your project isn’t succeeding in the ways you want? Maybe you’re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just can’t find new contributors and you’re drowning in issues and pull requests? Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow. In this talk we’ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together. After this talk you’ll be well-equipped with a ideas and strategies for growing, cultivating, and nourishing your Open Source project.
For your project to succeed, all of its non-code components must be well-maintained. What are these different components and what methods can we learn to maintain them?

   - Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, don’t just ask people for money.
   - Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard.
   - Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes.
   - Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner.
   - Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.
   - Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone.

With these methods and a half-dozen others, you’ll handle beautifully all the components your project needs to succeed.

I'll get started so this is my first

00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,810
time ever in Gothenburg and my first

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,090
time speaking at Faust North thank you

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,950
so much to Johan for inviting me and

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,110
thank you so much to all of you for

00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,939
being here and joining me a little bit

00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,250
about me first my name is Anna

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:36,490
I'm originally from Germany but I now

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,010
live in London and the UK I have a

00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,990
little bit of a non-traditional

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,940
background I studied English and

00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,760
Catholic theology in college because I

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,680
wanted to become a teacher some of you

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,170
may have identified William Shakespeare

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,390
and Pope Francis on my slide but about

00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,510
five years ago I got involved in Python

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,829
and in the Django communities and I

00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,800
really liked working at the intersection

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,769
of code and people so currently work on

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,600
the community team of elastic we also

00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,400
have a booth and the expo hall and we

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,160
have some really cool swag and swag back

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,620
so if you want to stop by afterwards

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,450
that would be really cool I'm also

00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,820
involved in a few other tech related

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,590
things outside of work I'm on the Python

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,409
Software Foundation board of directors

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,560
for example and I also run the PI ladies

00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:26,229
London meetup and one thing I do want to

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,210
mention is that I am actually affected

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,829
by mental illness I struggle with

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,689
depression and anxiety and you may

00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,820
wonder why is she mentioning this right

00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,710
now I'm doing this for a reason because

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,060
I think that mental illness is still

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,450
something we don't talk about enough

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,430
especially in tech and so I try to talk

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,790
but talk about it really openly in order

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,860
to normalize the topic but today I'm

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,299
here to talk to you about flourishing

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,149
floss and making your open source

00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,829
project successful I want to give a big

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,799
shout out to Tom Christie who's the

00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:58,570
creator of Django rest framework a lot

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,700
of what I've learned about open source

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,860
is from my time working as a community

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,590
and operations manager for Django rest

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,470
framework before I start I would like to

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,830
first do a small informal survey who

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,170
have you contribute to open source yeah

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,800
that's a lot of really cool who have you

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:20,140
our open source project maintainer --zz

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,000
okay still quite a few hands and who

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,269
have you have not contributed to open

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,420
source yet but are thinking about it

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,099
okay

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,379
also a few cool

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,989
today this talk actually isn't it about

00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,209
me I wanted to wrap it all into a story

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,420
so today I'm going to be talking about -

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:40,159
ladies called grace and ADA they both

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,140
work for a software company with an

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,099
open-source business model they work on

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,769
the same team

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,269
ADA's is self-taught software engineer

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,640
who's been working in the field for

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,430
three years grace has been working in

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,590
the field for five years and she started

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,090
her own open-source project about a year

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,400
and a half ago but as you will see

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,329
throughout this talk her project could

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,190
use some help today grace and a tie have

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,170
a conversation in the office their

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,049
company recently launched a program

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,150
which lets employees donate money to

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,340
open source projects of their choice

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,230
and this starts a conversation between

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,629
the two women about open source in

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,430
general grace and ADA brainstorm a

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,200
couple of open source projects that they

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,620
know they come up for example with

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,530
Python Django beware and elasticsearch

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,230
and grace isn't super sure what open

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,329
source code really is so she asks ADA to

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,180
explain it to her and ADA explains that

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,669
open source basically means that code is

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:43,879
publicly accessible it is reusable and

00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:46,280
it is modifiable ADA also says that when

00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,680
most of us think of open source we think

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,739
of code but actually there is much more

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,930
to it than just code you need all these

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,510
components which you can see on my slide

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,760
and actually at least I believe so in

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,319
order to run a successful open source

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,329
project and that's what we'll be talking

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:08,449
about today let's start with the other M

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,549
word money and so grace wonders with so

00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,859
many open source projects struggle with

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:17,359
funding although the tech industry as we

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:19,099
all know is in general very wealthy and

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,810
I think the biggest problem is that

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:24,349
people don't understand that it's about

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,539
giving back meant also giving forward so

00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:29,510
by contributing to open source either

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:32,300
with physical resources just such as

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,120
contributing code or with monetary

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,030
resources giving back financially you

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,830
also give forward if you think about

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,870
open source projects that you use for

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,330
work I'm sure

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,310
you use some open-source project think

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,110
about if the project stopped being

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,699
maintained they wouldn't request and you

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,010
they wouldn't accept any pull requests

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,870
anymore your tickets and issues wouldn't

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,060
get worked on that would eventually

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,389
become a huge problem and I think that

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,639
is something that a lot of us don't

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,790
recognize but also what I want to point

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,590
out is that a lot of people think that

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,030
you can just ask for money and it just

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,190
doesn't work that way you actually have

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,260
to give people something valuable in

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,630
return so the project that I mentioned

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,110
Django rest framework which I worked for

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,690
Tom Christie built this sustainable

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,270
giving money model where people would

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,850
give between 15 and 400 dollars a month

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,340
and they would get certain perks for it

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,930
like advertisement or special support or

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,330
something like that and the reason that

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,430
I believe that monthly models like that

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,260
work really well is that they kind of

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,550
sustain the financial support whereas

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,789
one-time donations are not as

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,960
sustainable so grace says that she

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,600
implemented this new feature and you

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,460
sometimes may see people asking on

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,830
Twitter for patreon donations if you

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,110
don't know patreon is a basically a

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,580
fundraising tool I would say and she

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,620
says she recently implemented this

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,570
feature but and then she thought this

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,630
would be a good time to ask people for

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,760
money but no one ever donated anything

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,990
to her and ADA kind of smells about it

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,060
and she explains to grace if she has

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,160
asked those open-source contributors of

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,830
the future that she implemented an X is

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,200
actually useful to them so I found this

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,660
tweet about a year ago and it is a bit

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,639
aggressive but I think the point comes

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,860
through so I do want to read it in case

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
there are some people on here who have

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,570
visual impairments and comment cannot

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,460
see my slide users don't hate change

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,680
users hate when you take control from

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,530
them users hate when your change shows

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,419
no value for them users hate when

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,310
they've invested in learning your design

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,220
and only for you to disregard that

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:50,289
investment users don't hate change it's

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,330
you not them so yeah basically you need

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,080
to give people something valuable in

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,210
return

00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:06,039
listen to them don't just make any

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:07,419
changes that are not useful it's also

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,969
important to establish good

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,340
communication systems to keep people

00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:13,539
informed they are especially important

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,939
if you want to cultivate new

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:18,219
contributors they will eventually need a

00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,930
way for you to reach out for that for

00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,669
them to reach out to you or for you to

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,199
reach out to them there's nothing more

00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,120
frustrating when you're trying to

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,680
contribute or trying to get started with

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,930
a new open source project and you're

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,659
struggling and there's no way for you to

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,909
get help so there's certain ways you can

00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,819
do that you can have a slack channel you

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:39,430
can have a special hashtag on Twitter

00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:42,039
you can respond to github issues you can

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,479
respond and discuss you can even respond

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,430
on IRC

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,409
just keep in mind that IRC is actually

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,599
really hard to use for coding beginners

00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:51,669
I remember when I started coding and

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,560
just installing her he was a huge

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,319
struggle for me and I think that's

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,879
something that a lot of us don't realize

00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,889
something I do want to point out is that

00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,840
it's important that you engage with

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,639
people via the means they choose to

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,310
engage with you so if someone reaches

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,719
out to you on Twitter get back to them

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:14,949
on Twitter don't get back to them via

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:17,529
email for example also something that we

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,509
don't do enough is thanking people so if

00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,219
you think about it has someone ever

00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:25,180
thanked you for making an open-source

00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:28,449
contribution who have you have gotten to

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,219
thank you okay that's quite a few but I

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,930
think in general we can just be better

00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,839
about being kind to each other and

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,630
saying thank you and I think it makes

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,969
sense to think all the people that

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,099
contribute to an open-source project not

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,769
just the people who write code thank

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,839
them thank the people who do your social

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,120
media who are community managers thank

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,579
them in your release notes sent them a

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,120
happiness packet mikey ariel gave a

00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:57,370
wonderful talk this morning it was the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,930
docs or it didn't happen talk and she's

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,930
one of the creators of the happiness

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,459
packets and it's a wonderful tool where

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,610
you can send little messages to people

00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,769
to just say thank you to them I try to

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,990
send a couple every Friday every Friday

00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:13,660
and my week by sending five or so

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,459
happiness packets I sent them to people

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,680
who've made my week better or who I just

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,209
want to cheer up and I promise it'll

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,940
make you happy too my spreading

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:26,980
happiness to other people in the middle

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,079
of the conversation greats gets an email

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,350
notification from github someone is

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,420
having trouble installing the open

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,450
source open source software that she

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,350
pushed out and she's kind of frustrated

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,240
because she thinks that her

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,190
documentation is really good and but she

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,279
admits that she gets emails like that

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,079
quite often so ADA asks if she can see

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,920
the documentation and it looks something

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,860
like this

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,839
step one run this command step two some

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,360
magic happening in between and step

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,370
three the software should work now you

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
may laugh now but I've actually stumbled

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,920
across a lot of documentation that looks

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,839
like this we often forget a ton of steps

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,490
in the middle and then ADA pulls up this

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,920
image on her phone I think it's really

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,990
brilliant it says how to draw an owl

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,380
draw some circles and then draw the rest

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,420
of the owl it is quite funny but if you

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,940
think about someone who's maybe just

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,010
starting an open-source or isn't

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,990
familiar is even a coder but not

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,490
familiar with this one certain project

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,220
they will struggle and if your

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,140
documentation is bad then people will

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,120
move on to a different project I think

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,220
if you need more than 30 minutes to

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,199
figure out how to install something it's

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:43,540
very unlikely that people will stick

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:46,449
with it yeah ADA Gray's defense herself

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,699
as we all do sometimes when you read

00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:51,370
documentation maybe even include some

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,699
gifts or some pictures screenshots I

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,260
think any visuals are super helpful

00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,880
we're all different kinds of learners

00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,410
and for example a very visual learner

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,600
for me there's nothing better than

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,290
watching a YouTube video of someone

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,329
actually typing the code and something

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,279
that we also should consider is this is

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,290
a great opportunity for grace to

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,089
actually get help with her documentation

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,100
the best way to get help with your

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,959
documentation is to ask someone who's

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,000
struggling on who's figuring out how to

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,780
install something to update the

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,160
documentation

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,860
make it better and to write down

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,540
step-by-step what they've been doing and

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,970
it's kind of a win-win situation because

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,800
at the same time you also maybe

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,170
encourage them to make their very very

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,060
own very first contribution to an

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,580
open-source project which is really cool

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,410
and then a side note open source

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,020
contributions do not have to be code

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,090
patches my first ever contribution was

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,160
just going through the Django Girls

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,080
tutorial jingle girls is an organization

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,780
which teaches women how to code by

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,860
helping them build a blog and I just

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,270
went through the tutorial and I

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,660
corrected grammar and punctuation

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,760
mistakes because I'm an English major so

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,560
that's kind of my jam and you may think

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,420
this is not important but it actually is

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,880
because it made the tutorial easier to

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,550
read for everyone and in return it

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,710
helped me get over that fear of making

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,710
my first ever open source contribution

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,580
and grace mentions that she looked at

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,860
this person's github profile she noticed

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,500
as this person is a beginner and I think

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,570
that we often catch ourselves thinking

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,370
that we oh this is a beginner it would

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,380
be too much work to actually help them

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:33,040
if you think about it that thought

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,140
probably has crossed your mind you but

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,410
mentorship doesn't need to take a ton of

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,440
time mentorship can't you can set aside

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,330
an hour to a week all of us have that

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,880
time and mentorship is actually super

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,100
rewarding so I do encourage you that if

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,589
you contribute to open source or you

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,930
maintain an open source project try to

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:54,880
cultivate the next generation of open

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,920
source project contributors and

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,080
maintainer is because the reality is if

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,880
we don't try to make open source

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,040
sustainable right now we will at some

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,650
point run into problems because none of

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,690
us live forever so we need to kind of

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,589
cultivate the next generation of open

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,589
source contributors

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,090
think something we take for granted is

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,470
that open-source projects need

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,330
contributors from people of

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:26,670
contributions from people of all skill

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:29,340
levels and expertise as I said this is

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,040
just a small exercise if you're

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,630
interested I thought it was kind of cool

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,450
if you want to see what your first ever

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,490
PR was go to this website first PR dot M

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:46,680
e and you can see what it was I found it

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:52,760
kind of cool to see what I did talked

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,760
about that yeah

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,560
so Grayson ADA continued the

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,860
contribution by ADA being the

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,510
conversation by ADA being a little bit

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,370
frustrated because she sees that

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,440
projects like elasticsearch have way

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,959
over a thousand contributors in her

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,079
project has very little contributors so

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,029
she wonders why that is and why not more

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,320
people contribute to her open-source

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:26,029
project and then grace ADA brings up if

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,370
ADA ever does something to actually

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,079
promote her project maybe you're in the

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,350
same situation you have this great pot

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,480
project you have great codes but no one

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,980
knows about your project and grace

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,920
mentions that she tweets about it

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,660
sometimes maybe like once a month like

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,990
some of us do but that's often not

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,839
enough you actually need to market your

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,180
open-source project you need incentives

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,209
for people we add elastic we give these

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,950
cool pins to our community organizers I

00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,720
have one in my backpack and people stop

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,700
me all the time and they see the pin and

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,230
they want one too and then I tell them

00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,810
yeah you can have one if you become a

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,970
community organizer so it can be

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,040
something very small like this these

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,110
pins doesn't don't cost us a lot of

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,209
money but people really appreciate them

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,740
or give them special stickers we all

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,470
love our stickers and the tech community

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,000
and printing stickers is so cheap so

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,010
that's a good way to incentivize people

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,570
to contribute to your open source

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:25,940
project and besides social media your

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,430
project also needs a website including a

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,740
blog it needs a mailing list and it

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,470
needs people to evangelize talk about it

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:38,149
a conferences run hackathons mentor

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:41,420
people and so on very says that she's

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,980
not really good at social media and ADA

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,990
says that there are people in the

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,250
community who may be good at social

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,320
media this is what I meant that

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,660
contributions to open source don't have

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,000
to involve code and we need people of

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,160
all expertise levels everyone has

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,620
different talents if you look at this

00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,540
little gopher superwoman for example

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,579
there's a woman and the Microsoft

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,380
community called Ashley McNamara she's a

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:06,860
developer evangelist but she's also very

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,350
talented artist and she created a

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,820
website called gopher Esme where you can

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,330
create a global gopher version of

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,790
yourself

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,100
and this has nothing to do with code per

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,890
se but people love stickers people of

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,000
fun little things so she uses her talent

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:24,350
to bring something else to open source

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,779
and while Ada and Grace get a quick

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,510
coffee break and I get a little sip of

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,970
water I want you to take maybe 10 20

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,070
seconds to think about or write down one

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,589
individual talent other than coding

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,899
which you can use to contribute to open

00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:41,800
source though maybe just think about it

00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,800
for 10 seconds

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,850
right besides diversity of talents

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,820
something we take for granted is

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,120
diversity of contributors it matters and

00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,160
by diversity I mean more than just women

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,380
we need people of different ethnicities

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,690
we need people of different age groups

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,670
of different sexual orientations and of

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,860
different educational backgrounds all of

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,860
us bring something new to open source

00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,960
grace shares with Ada that she sometimes

00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,510
struggles with assigning tasks to people

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,730
who offer to help I think that tasks

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,080
distribution is a huge problem and I

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,200
think that another problem is that

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,120
people I sometimes describe people in

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,950
open sores like Gollum the little

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,020
creature from Lord of the Rings I think

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,420
we can be very like this is mine and I

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,340
don't want other people to contribute to

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,560
this maybe this is funny but I've ever

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,150
experienced it a lot and so I do

00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
recommend that you assign roles to

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,200
people who reach out and who want to

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,350
help and give them ownership like the

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,820
most successful thing I've seen done an

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,380
open-source or really in project

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,080
management in general is to give people

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,850
jobs maybe have a social media manager

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,000
have a community manager have someone

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,830
who is the owner of ticket triage it

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,690
makes your life easier and it give makes

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,060
the person feel special because they are

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:20,500
the owner of a certain area of your

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,450
open-source project so grace for example

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,700
struggles will take a triage so it would

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,560
be really important for her to find

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,300
someone like that and ticket readjust

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,390
actually is something really important

00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,150
that a lot of us don't want to do or

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:38,560
don't like to do but if tickets weren't

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:40,870
assessed by urgency and difficulty or

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:46,300
assigned labels they would never get

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:48,760
worked on also I think it's important to

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,770
learn to say no and when you see a new

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,780
issue for example consider this is

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,610
something viable that you will be

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,140
working on in the new future if you see

00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,850
an issue and you already know that it's

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,880
not something you will be fixing on in

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,860
the next six months close it better than

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,990
to clutter up your repository with a

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,840
bunch of issues that you never will work

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:10,360
on anyway

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,860
bugs are a little bit different but if

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,000
you know that you won't be working on a

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,850
bug any time

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,690
maybe close it as an Onan imitation and

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,460
documented grace Cher's was a de that

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,500
she thinks she doesn't always do a good

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,370
job communicating with people so ADA

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,440
suggests that she engages and finds a

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,260
community manager because community is

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,539
something that I work on full-time our

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,250
team at elastic I think is about 20

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,470
people all over the world just working

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,820
on community so you can see that

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,620
community something that's really

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,530
important to us and I think community is

00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,210
important to open source in general this

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,610
is Brett cannon he's one of the core

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,230
contributors to Python and he came up

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,690
with this wonderful quote which I really

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,760
love he says I came for the language but

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,039
I stayed for the community and that's

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,510
true for me as well I haven't I honestly

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,039
haven't written a line of Python and

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,630
Perl II like three years or so but I'm

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:04,360
still super involved in the Python

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,130
community because to me it's like family

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,960
I had a lot I have a lot of friends

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,640
there so I think it's important to

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,289
cultivate these social relationships and

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,030
grace is thrilling scrolling through

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,350
Twitter as she's having the conversation

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,870
with Ada and she sees that there's

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,870
another heated discussion but of code of

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,909
conducts like we see most weeks sadly

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,850
and the common misconception is that you

00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:29,409
don't need a code of conduct for your

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,880
open source project grace for example

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:33,010
says nothing has ever happened people

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,929
are nice to each other but what people

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,610
don't realize is that you need to have a

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,950
code of conduct in place before

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,700
something happens just in case something

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,530
happens by actually not having a COC you

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,630
will lose contributors because people

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,640
don't feel safe if they don't know that

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,470
if you will do something if they get

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,539
harassed they just don't want to take

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,980
the risk of being involved in your

00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:58,900
open-source project there is a code of

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,730
conduct that I would recommend it's

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,289
called the contributor covenant you can

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,890
see the website here it's completely

00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,390
free it's been written by Coraline Aida

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,360
who's really big and open-source in the

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,520
Ruby community and it's completely free

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,440
you can implement it today so if you

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,450
have if your open shield sauce project

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,520
does not have a code of conduct please

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,250
do me a favor and implement one today

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,049
but also you need to be willing to

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,059
enforce your code of conduct it is not

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,320
enough to just have this document

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,820
written down there if someone

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,250
comes to you and they're being harassed

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,909
you need to be able to call people out

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,909
for bad behavior

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,980
alright so to sum up everything I've

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,809
talked about things that I recommend in

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,090
order to make your open-source project

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,340
successful listen to your contributors

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,110
and be responsive offer your financial

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,899
supporters something valuable in return

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,429
if you have financial supporters

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:53,740
establish good communication systems

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:57,220
thank all contributors of your project

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,110
not just those who write code write

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,360
thorough documentation including

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,909
screenshots and gifts acknowledge all

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,190
contribution contributions is equally

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:07,899
important

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:11,080
find contributors of all skill levels

00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:13,149
and expertise of your mentorship provide

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,250
contribution incentives work on

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:17,529
marketing including a website and a blog

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,409
and active Twitter account mailing list

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:22,899
and evangelism recognize the importance

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:26,350
of diversity of contributors and talents

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:28,750
and give contributors ownership learn to

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,120
say no to bugs and issues you won't fix

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,299
in the next six months instead document

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,700
them nurture your community and last but

00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,370
not least add a code of conduct and be

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,409
willing to enforce it

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,929
graceland ADA aren't specific people all

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:45,370
of us could be Grace and ADA maybe some

00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,169
of us has struggled with some of the

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,120
things that grace is struggling with and

00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:51,490
maybe some of us helped others like

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,200
ADA's helping grace I hope that you take

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,210
some of these tips and tricks' your

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,179
heart and maybe consider implementing

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,490
one thing or another into your open

00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:02,590
source project most of all I hope that

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,690
we can all learn to be a little kinder

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,120
to each other as open source project

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,179
maintainer zazz contributors and users

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,009
as developers and as humans one of my

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,659
favorite quotes is that everyone that

00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:19,179
you meet fights a battle you know

00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:21,220
nothing about so be kind always I won't

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,200
be taking questions it's on stage

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,759
because I'm actually really afraid of

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,279
Q&A because it's something I can't

00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:30,100
