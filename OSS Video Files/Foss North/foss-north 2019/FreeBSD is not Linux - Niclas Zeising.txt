Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	FreeBSD is an advanced open source Unix-like operating system with roots in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix originally distributed by the University of California, Berkeley. It is one of the oldest and largest open source projects in the world, having recently celebrated it's 25th birthday. FreeBSD is used to power modern servers, desktops and embedded system and its advanced networking, storage and security features makes it the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive networking and storage devices. When sending a network packet across the Internet, there is a good chance it will touch a FreeBSD system along the way.
This presentation will give an overview of the FreeBSD operating system and the FreeBSD project community. We will walk through what FreeBSD is, and the community behind it. I will also talk about the various features in FreeBSD, such as jails, ZFS, networking and virtualization and some of the places where FreeBSD can be found.
