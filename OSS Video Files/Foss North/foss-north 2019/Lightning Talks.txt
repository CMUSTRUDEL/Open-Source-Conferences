	00:00:15,960 --> 00:01:13,150
so yeah so I mean who's familiar with

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,450
the EIP batteries you use the other

00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,700
sense okay I guess so you know that

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,009
there is a percentage of the data race

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,450
and that it's impossible together we're

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:26,799
so up to date

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:28,030
pesto on one fights anymore so there is

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,350
this a I think a twist

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,350
Oh since the

00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:59,610
anyways you know that better if you have

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,280
used the library you will find out that

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,880
the files are really nice but since 2.0

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,350
license which means that GPL version 2

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,959
codes are not linked with stuff

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,060
libraries if you'll even know that well

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,760
now you do if you have a VPN listen to

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,069
program that tries to use a consent to

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,120
proceed 11e you cannot get them together

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:26,400
because of the anti patent clouds inside

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,290
that a Apache 2.0 libraries so we cut

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
like a problem the main issue is that

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,110
was max - stupid releasing new versions

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,170
of the new IP where someone like a

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,930
database it was impossible to get that

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,390
information on standard ppl superhero

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,120
products like for example the net

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:50,579
connect plus plus which is a program

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,519
that I use so what happened well I had

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:57,000
never used there a max mind ever since

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,100
ooh that's a 2.0 license at the library

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,620
but I knew that they had filled it nice

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,769
documentation explaining Houghton

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,510
library worketh so I you sit down for a

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,889
weakness and I said okay let's make this

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,720
a weekend place I'm going to sit down

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,370
I'm going to leave the specifications

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,859
and I'm going to see if I can get

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,959
something but at least with passed away

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:20,069
the data gives a lot of terrain uh back

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:24,120
to the user so I start down and I got

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:26,250
something working with c99 it's mostly

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,380
designed for use on embedded systems and

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,120
it is not so focused on performance but

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,660
of having a little footprint on the

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,970
program and it has this little problem

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,859
with evening and external locking with

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,350
multi-threaded applications because

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,239
basically I have to like read from

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,849
different offsets of the database file

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,060
and

00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,430
I need to be able to first to move to

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,790
this offset and then get away at the

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,409
tiny tree which if you are using c99 you

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,760
know that that is basically no portable

00:03:54,409 --> 00:04:00,739
way of doing so the same with the smell

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,290
lemony you think I'd like approach so

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,569
you use open the database file use the

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,090
database in order to do the lookup so

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:12,019
they get them a table that you want and

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,209
when you are going to close it they are

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,340
simple the callee will allocate using

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,459
malloc at aretha you need and you have

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,880
to call a specific function - free the

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,169
raita once you have gone well the main

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,930
issue with is that the basis is that

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,370
they are totally understood so you don't

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,250
know which data types they are going to

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,680
get when you send a request which is

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,699
hard to model in C as you probably know

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,009
so I have to do some internal data types

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,919
and particular are very ugly Union one

00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:45,199
that I am not particularly proto but I

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,599
have I am providing auxiliary access

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,360
functions for some of these useful

00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:54,409
operations so that you will need to

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,440
focus so much on these details so what I

00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:59,000
learned from this project well the first

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,430
thing I'd add is that the person to of

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,849
the max mind database has lots path

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:08,960
cities lots of rooms for improvement

00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:11,449
I mean it's not efficient at all but

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,030
it's made in order to make that fit on a

00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,159
really small database so that is place

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,330
why they did many of the design services

00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,789
reveal I know that I am mapping table 5

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,430
could be faster the problem is that so

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,460
many systems only have up to 52 bits and

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,320
according to the specification max mind

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,849
database 5 may be bigger some for

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,270
 which is what you can fit in

00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,580
the space car so this will happen at

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,360
some point but I still haven't

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,610
implemented it yeah there is no portable

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,979
way atomically living from a file at a

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,750
specific offset you have to first put

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,580
the pointer of the pilot or certain

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,729
temperature data which can be

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,620
problematic if you have

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:57,689
many threats using the same 500 either

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,669
select that you can use unions on both

00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,669
pointers in order to bypass a lot of

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,319
that type Maggie chat see uses in order

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,419
to force you to use of specific types

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,039
when you have more understand collect

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,969
data so that to the abuse that can be

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,699
you support for things like JSON parsers

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:16,460
yeah to sync a license is very important

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,539
you have to be very careful because a

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,789
compatibility stuff up and I mean

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,330
obviously almost nobody's going to go

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:26,159
for something like the WTF PLN license

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,860
they do what the you want with this

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:57,379
code item M so as soon as you start

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:57,379
putting smothers you will find out so

00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:24,959
yeah so I'm going to flip in their sleep

00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:27,719
try to spend one more minute in trying

00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,229
to set this and in likely case it

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,229
doesn't works

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,889
[Music]

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,619
[Music]

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:53,140
so this is a really simple example this

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:56,110
new spoiler like telling you how to use

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,699
very you can see that yeah we convert

00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,529
the IP others that are in resided in

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,329
text format into the binary format that

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,870
is useful you said you said four hundred

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:09,310
things yourselves then we can do lookups

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:12,010
and we just go and explore a little bit

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,320
down you will see that we basically use

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,970
preach the weight of a vehicle to the

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,579
new car or just say stop the blue car

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,579
fails and you cannot get the beta so

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:29,410
this is so as you can see ap sister is

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,089
little program like a Ferrari composite

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,790
this is Hannah have seven like happiness

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,880
pain and I did not see that our data

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,350
what they over there gather sees as we

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,589
use a clue with the old version of the

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:45,510
library at the rest of it now we are

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,510
also use it with Henry where self 6a

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,299
[Applause]

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:31,020
which is online this is 90 minutes in

00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,360
more like it's about what money to

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:42,420
bananas or OC I would see right if

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:44,720
you're a person who likes PLA that's 300

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,960
C is about the open containers

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,750
initiative that was spun off by drop

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,370
girls from a 13 2015 in order to make a

00:10:51,750 --> 00:11:00,960
standard space way of running and

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:03,450
storing containers so it's the it's the

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,780
wrong time specification and image

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:12,920
specification and when I talked about

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:14,040
what man it's to actually two different

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,950
programs

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,910
so there's hot month for running

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,980
containers similar to dr. Ron and then

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,100
it's spun off into a separate project

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,820
big enough for for building container

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,640
images so more like document in two

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,370
hundred also the doctor file format and

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,090
the name bill that was because the main

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:42,020
developer is from Boston so that's our

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,020
filter songs

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,310
Oh

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,320
so the next was kubernetes and then

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,840
kubernetes might know it's an

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,330
orchestration system built on top of the

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:12,290
container system so we're what man and

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:17,110
the underlying operating system runs the

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:19,880
system and this would orchestrate so

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,790
kubernetes introduced this CRI which is

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,160
the container runtime interface there

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,050
was a alternative implementation instead

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,420
of this bulky docker team and there was

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:34,930
a lightweight container on time is

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:37,670
called Fido and lately as in this year

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,250
one of the lead developers of Rancher

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,040
got tired of the footprint of kubernetes

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,550
on especially embedded devices so he

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,330
came up with a k3s product with it which

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,790
is done is five less than cakes so he

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:59,660
threw out all the other features all the

00:12:52,790 --> 00:13:02,750
non default features and all the out of

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,260
three drivers so all intruders out and

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:10,460
then he switched database from the

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,940
normally see it back to sequel so it

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:17,810
runs equal light into the database and

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,940
that this makes it fit in a very small

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:25,790
footprint the download is less than 50

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:28,820
megabytes so this is a diagram of how it

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,610
works together most of you might be

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,500
familiar with how doctor talks to the

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,130
doctor daemon which done talks to the

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,050
container daemon which finally talks to

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:43,430
well not in it but enough abstraction

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,650
quadrants II and they explained is run C

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,260
program that because continues are

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,870
actually an array of complicated

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,600
sometimes arcane system features of XE

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,160
groups and many spaces we are integrated

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,870
in the unified load of

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,810
with quadrant C to run containers and

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:06,500
then Froyo talks to this run C and if

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:10,339
you're using Padma then Portman can talk

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,990
directly to a small program called

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:19,490
common and that were told to run see

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,759
right that was the background and that's

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,759
right

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:44,000
so I cheated a bit by recording it this

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,480
morning but it went out of this ISO

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,730
image and I have this project called

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,740
book - Padma which is if you're familiar

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,350
with book the doctor this is a similar

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,270
concept when you sing Padma machine

00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:01,070
which is that similar to doctor machine

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,320
so it will create the virtual machine

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:08,810
with a new enough Linux kernel that we

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:12,860
need to run this and then it will set up

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:15,920
SSH on this virtual machine that you can

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:21,350
then log into the machine in order to

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:24,530
run while your basic containers but the

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,110
new thing for this new release is that

00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,820
you have a small download which is a

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,450
hundred megabytes which gives you the

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,900
Pokemon containers if you go for the big

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,900
download which is the 175 megabytes then

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,120
you also get cryo and KT 3s

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,210
I've only package them at this point

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,990
they're not really loaded by default see

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:51,560
we'll have to load them first and then

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,930
I'm a bundle the images we need which is

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,630
the infrastructure for English and the

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,400
core DNS so these are normal doctor

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,470
images and is a bundle with the

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,170
Downloads I load them from a directory

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,970
and here we start the k3s server without

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:10,700
the optional traffic and load balancer

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:14,150
because those are like bigger than the

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,250
rest of the tumbler themselves and now

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,590
it's starting the cubelet which is the

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:23,260
main component of kubernetes and what

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:28,720
you talk to and then we can run

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:31,720
cubanelles so this point is version 135

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,720
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,470
and here is the Troy cutter which is the

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,510
lower level interface you can talk about

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,590
interfaces and here is the process tree

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:52,860
on the VM so here we can see these

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,590
common monitoring processes they handle

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:59,100
login and having networking for the

00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:03,020
actual containers which are done the

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:06,060
other processes and now we have the cryo

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,280
monitor and the key 3s server but there

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,760
is no naka demon spawning these other

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,760
processes they are directly started and

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,760
then there is some other stuff to handle

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:25,830
Deb random and to be able to shut down

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:28,740
and so on but the footprint of the

00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:33,180
system is about 250 megabytes either in

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,470
Raman 512 megabytes totality running and

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:49,470
then you need space for your own

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:51,510
applications of course it's also given

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:58,500
my driver but the VirtualBox is still

00:17:51,510 --> 00:18:02,190
the small so one other thing you

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,760
mentioned in the last minute or 45

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,350
seconds is that foramen ovale RC if your

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:15,270
kernel is new enough then you can run

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:17,580
containers without without being the

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,030
root users we also think Oh root let's

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,030
continue

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:35,680
optimistic trusting the Wi-Fi so here

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:38,530
you have your container but you don't

00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:47,740
need fruit to start it instead it lives

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:51,580
in the local share containers and you

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:57,490
need Linux 4.18 inure for other features

00:18:51,580 --> 00:19:11,200
to work this one comes with 490 in the

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:36,850
latest release and you had 90 seconds to

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:44,140
spare okay so fortunately my battery

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:50,490
died while working but I want to talk to

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:54,910
you about the book which is a

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,100
bookkeeping administration system for

00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,160
Swedish conditions

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,160
[Music]

00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:17,539
not work obviously some sorry free book

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:21,570
um was from the beginning a proprietary

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:24,950
system called Davis County that was

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:28,119
liberated in 2009

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,119
[Music]

00:20:41,800 --> 00:21:01,570
I'm impressed but very free of all the

00:20:44,350 --> 00:21:04,330
guys okay so as you can see the slides

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,460
are in Swedish but I will talk in

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,400
English over everyone who doesn't

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:14,170
understand can at least get what it's

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,570
about so for us already set its to the

00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,550
accounting and administration system so

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:23,710
it's not only administration I need to

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:26,950
stress this also accounting so it's and

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,560
you can have several associations and

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,380
companies of course and you can use it

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,260
for you for your association or it can

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,830
be accounting console to see yourself

00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:41,140
and you can of course use it with many

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:45,130
different types of like artists care

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:52,690
it's like well most short or longer you

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:54,700
can use any what it up and then yeah

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,710
okay this was not looking very good but

00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,040
this is how it looks and you can see it

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:07,210
a duck's bit so the left-hand version is

00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:11,500
from Mac OS the right-hand image is from

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,980
from the more Linux perspective image

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,350
looks a bit different in Windows but

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:21,630
basically this is what you see and all

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:29,410
of the many things if you have sales

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:34,270
purchases banking storage and accounting

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:36,760
and of course you can import and export

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:41,320
from other systems so

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,720
can use the Swedish see remote as it can

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,760
export it to your company if you want to

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,680
do the anthem hear something or so on

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,960
and you can also export it for for doing

00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,050
the tax let's top say that it's money

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,530
and so there are a lot of accounting

00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:03,460
class coming with free book and can also

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:05,830
important is we young change them and if

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,790
you have a previous hearing money in

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:12,910
your see a feel it was very cool getting

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:17,440
ported on the EMV thus others will be

00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:23,500
according to to what your stomach's yes

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:26,230
to continue accounting and some quick

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:32,010
facts and I can see it's cutting here

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:37,840
not good but it's new GPL free so it's

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:41,530
where it's a job application and it so

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,130
it runs on a lot of platforms so well

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:51,160
you can also make purchase orders and

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:53,770
stuff like that and so on and if you

00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:59,620
have recurring invoices you can also

00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:04,600
send out those and so of course if you

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:07,930
want to do your you have a store we

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:12,340
cannot were some your sandals for

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:17,170
freedom and inventory and so on and if

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:23,060
you're importing stuff from China you

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:25,670
can do the correct vit handling and

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:30,680
and attack something for that so that

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:32,900
works fine and if you are a bit quoted

00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,020
with the accounting you can get some

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,550
help with how to use it with the help

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:44,240
system which is very extensible and

00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:47,060
extensive the help files they are in

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:52,460
workbook so it's open next month for

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:57,680
months so how does it look well very

00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:00,680
blurry and I'll say but this is a report

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,330
so it's about the the verifications that

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:07,490
you have put into the system and I also

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,370
want to say something about the this

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:14,120
stuff that you see at least down to the

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,910
right which is the line of liberal which

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,060
is satellite tool and four FS cons which

00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:24,230
is coming for its twelfth edition this

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:26,620
year and I love Libra will happen now

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:30,560
undone and the next time it will be in

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:33,850
May it's very focused on practical

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:36,560
things so last time we were doing a

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:42,050
graphical production music production

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:44,600
and also accounting so next time it will

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:48,950
be something with leather and stuff like

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:53,240
that so this is the summary so I think

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm still in time to it yeah so you just

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,150
want to say if you want to use the book

00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,270
you can get it from three pocket or if

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,660
you work with something paper to have

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:09,110
this constant can do that

00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:12,120
is the US consulate or kiss did address

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,030
if you want to take part in our free

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,630
emailing Association g+ can find out

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,250
information about data people support my

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,380
company three programmers in the cottage

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:27,030
you can find that day and appropriate

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:29,670
URL down there so yeah that's basically

00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:32,900
what we wanted to say on the absorb

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,900
forth or the battery going flatting the

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,900
second

00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:46,099
I'm sorry the date spread this constant

00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:49,459
I know it's in the fall yet so November

00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:51,229
November yeah and it will be an Oscar

00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:53,889
this year because we have a sister

00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:53,889
organization

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,849
[Music]

00:27:53,270 --> 00:28:01,110
all right now I can start so sorry about

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:06,930
this how much time you spend six thirty

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:09,870
okay alright so I I'm gonna talk to you

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:13,230
about the whole project I've made like

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:15,360
only half a year ago and decided this

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:20,300
last night because supplements or wine

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:25,740
sir stuff so this is the sonic discs

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:28,530
it's like yeah 360 was just one extender

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,920
that's - so very briefly about me and

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:34,860
Dimitri's I grew up in Rhodes Greece I

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,840
work 90 percent that semuc which is a 3d

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,480
bioprinting company and 10 percent that

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,700
of course responsible at the University

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,560
of Gothenburg some personal interests

00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,560
abilities types of architecture API

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,390
design robotics I've seen stuff like and

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,750
then have a look that I write about my

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:57,150
new stuff so very briefly about this its

00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:01,560
sensor module that has eight motor sonic

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:05,370
distance measurement sensors on it at 45

00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,080
degree angles it communicates via i2c to

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,080
another microphones over or a raspberry

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,060
pi rod node and can be used either as an

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,130
Arduino sit or stand alone so right now

00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,210
I'm having it as an Arduino synced over

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,180
an Arduino No

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,090
so why I needed the 360 view of the

00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,080
environment for my projects and I needed

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,940
to be cheap

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,360
I didn't want cables so the next best

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,520
solution I could find were very cheap

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,460
lighters from China but then I would

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,400
still have to find a way to

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,060
with all the problems that and she

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,980
moving parts so how the all these

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,320
ultrasonic sensors are triggered at the

00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,620
same time and then we wave the

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,880
interrupts for their echo to return and

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:55,070
then we infer the distance so currently

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,940
it's measuring every 10 milliseconds so

00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:01,940
it makes a 10 10 milliseconds able to

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,650
select sensor measurements and they

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,660
encourage you to build yourself so it

00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,660
turns on me almost only through-hole

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:11,540
components it has those ancestors and it

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,460
has enough mega 3:38 328p

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,670
which is the same sensor found on

00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,890
Arduino no absolutely pretty much an

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:24,860
Arduino connected to a Bluetooth sonic

00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:29,390
sensors in this time to port so I use

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:32,270
this to for my little autonomous vehicle

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:37,010
projects so just to prove what it can do

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:39,110
in about afternoon I paint its Park and

00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,280
increasingly smaller space with the same

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:45,890
code so it doesn't use any odometers or

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:50,840
gyroscope nothing so just by using the

00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:58,280
sensors it could manage to part and I

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:59,840
think it's not over it so it's an

00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,030
operative project you can find the

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,760
everything about it meaning both the

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,920
documentation hardware stores or

00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,620
software source on github and you can

00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:14,180
read a bit about it on my blog how much

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:17,840
left remaining Oh perfect so they look

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,850
like I would dare do it like demo and so

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,750
hopefully you can see this so I will

00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:25,780
connect it didn't have USB it does on

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,780
the

00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:33,800
so now I have to figure out that I don't

00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:37,700
know if this is there ah

00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:42,020
is it alright so the screen resolution

00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:47,030
didn't help but overall I think this is

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:57,250
the u.s. number one over us zero sorry

00:31:47,030 --> 00:32:01,460
so you can see the first so the first

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,860
u.s. zero should be changing as I move

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,830
my hand

00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:10,640
so number one is this one and so on so

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,410
this way we have a 360 view the

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:22,179
surrounding states all coming over right

00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:22,179
you see so any questions about it

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,300
exactly what because it doesn't work yet

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:38,540
is it compatible with that most chance

00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:42,520
I believe so these these are like doing

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:45,350
these really cheap ultrasonic sensors

00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,130
yeah I think it's rather safe I don't

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,130
expect them to

00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,530
so here to talk to you it is I ran into

00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,210
a few people at the social event that

00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,310
actually haven't heard of tu major it's

00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,320
protocol before so I figured - a little

00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:50,220
of length talked about it and the super

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,830
friend I don't know actually I'm not

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:57,270
part of the matrix team I'm just a user

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:59,040
and it's just about it so take the lucky

00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,080
winner but yeah so the matrix program

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,630
what is the matrix part it's an open

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,650
standard for an interoperable

00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:08,160
interoperable to sacrifice real-time

00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,720
communication over IP or as I personally

00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,370
quite like it it's a it's a and

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,350
eventually consistent global JSON

00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:16,860
database with an HTTP API and parts of

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:19,380
semantics so matrix matrix is a

00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,840
generated from all over the the regular

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:25,530
transport server HTTP with Jason they

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,910
also have a problem a liquid to the

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,370
purpose time to implementation over

00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:32,250
Covanta C or using the noise clarity and

00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,590
noise player or UDP which actually was

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,670
demoing to demonstrate working over a

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:39,240
less than 100

00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:41,220
a second link alinker it would take over

00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,700
two minutes of transmit a single

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:46,650
Ethernet frame inches 1500 bytes the

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,720
purple is history having every message

00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,570
is encoded site by your home server and

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,510
coded into each local jason tagging a

00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:57,360
merkin graphically which is centralized

00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,890
to each room in their matrix it has a

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,700
built-in semantics for end-to-end

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:04,590
encryption same year the whole system

00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,440
which is based on the signal ratchet

00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:11,190
they also may go on top of that to do in

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,230
session key handling it supports web RTC

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,750
signaling for voice of Mikey

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,820
so and it also supports group chat at

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,890
the moment using in the jetty system

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,170
that they are working on also doing that

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:25,200
in with their own matrix centralized

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,210
system okay so who actually uses the

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,760
matrix this for statistics taken from

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,190
the Voyager which is city and thickest

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,440
artists a PhD project by one guy he

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,000
built a baktun to moves around the

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,040
matrix a co system discovering rooms

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,800
discovering users figuring out graph

00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,590
links between the rooms as a choice of

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,600
matrix is very heavily used and these

00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,160
areas to discover statistics matrix

00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,330
themselves have missed dishes from their

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,710
original home server which reports about

00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,390
2.6 million user adjust on their own

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,300
server of course it's a federated

00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,430
protocol so it's been hard to actually

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,830
know this data for every service every

00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:07,050
service run by another person in the

00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:08,790
modern group and you can find all the

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,130
statistics there on the voyage circle or

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,840
at your site it's actually real license

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,750
that about me you can find real an ISO

00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,000
file on site I imagine this guy got in

00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:21,740
feed even gotten very high grades on HD

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,370
is in the state or so and also a matrix

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:28,680
matrix is actually this built to do is a

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,440
generator that taken into a system they

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,420
call app services into it because as it

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,210
turns out one way to actually get into

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,250
the

00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:38,950
to already have people communicating

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:41,050
over us over client or network you

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,089
support some matrix has two built-in

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:45,130
bridges for several different protocols

00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:48,040
like you they then an email for a

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,630
channel which is rated fun I don't use

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,460
it myself is really fun but the most

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,410
common ones are the IRC bridge which is

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,560
hosted by matrixyl Borg you can join any

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,520
freedom through mind doing game net and

00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,470
will said no Celeste

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,089
it's breached from there as well they

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,440
have a bridges school Sabritas for

00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:03,940
hangouts there goes the bridges for this

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,369
poor thing must've bridges for slack

00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,240
from get her you can answer to any of

00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:09,310
those rooms it's just

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,640
but really it's transparent you can join

00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,440
it with Animatrix client and there will

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,240
still working on several other ways and

00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:21,430
yeah this is a response to name xkcd

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:24,760
comics super aware of that that's more

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:27,099
and more like you actually

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,800
users can he recently move older

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,630
communication Ultimatrix after matrix

00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,940
themselves cemented go into contact with

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,280
the french state in this case density in

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,250
particular which is feet which is the

00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,580
years it'll institute further

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,050
information technology the french state

00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,150
employees ninety percent of the entire

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,980
population and they're centralizing

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,740
older communication all to the federated

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,140
matrix network through their own

00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:55,330
separated federations so this is there

00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,640
is a really really nice thought from a

00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,109
Matthew D predict bomber on the what she

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,119
held at FOSDEM user this year Philip

00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:04,330
Johnson room the largest

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,150
actually room on the venue matrix also

00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,619
used by serve which is the project in

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:13,839
Holland for doing university

00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:19,750
communication damnit I have notes for

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:21,790
this potential so scientists so matrix

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,349
built is built on home server exists a

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,000
federated protocol every user is

00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,770
technically suppose those their own home

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
server but that's not really viable in

00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:33,550
many cases still DB semantics is every

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,900
server same home server decide to be run

00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,640
in your home the reference

00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,920
implementation currently signups its

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,450
built-in Python twisted it's actually by

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,370
the three nowadays they've deprecated

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,590
attitude but 1.0 will release

00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,540
to support still there weren't really a

00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:50,630
replacement server reading ago called

00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,550
dendrite the development is slightly

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,560
halted because of their turns out and

00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:59,540
start to work on a replacement service

00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,700
when your current services on fire they

00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,130
they become a bit more popular than they

00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,660
expect it to be so yeah although there

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,980
are some community projects twelve those

00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,390
remote written in rust

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,670
there's still currently on hiatus

00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,240
waiting for the stink-eye Beaupre to

00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,010
finish

00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,650
there's the construct which is a really

00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,960
cool project that actually integrates of

00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,400
Mayer CD and the matrix or into one so

00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,320
every High City use the results of

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,520
matrix you sir

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,020
there's plasmid which is written in

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,330
let's try and learned about this I did

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,730
not know that existed but it does the

00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:34,460
genome which is written in Java because

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:36,020
it's a used to gamma but of course being

00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,600
it being an open protocol all that

00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,790
there's also a hell of a lot of clients

00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,980
these are just the officially listed

00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,520
ones they're plenty more

00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:48,680
that's like there is bu flagship there's

00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,420
a web-based version of an electron

00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,750
there's all of it so since it's also

00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,120
electron you can layer desktop and there

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,640
is some iOS client written by a team I

00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,080
think they're in France they other

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,320
entity and then proclaimed I know a

00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,750
certain by team advanced there's no echo

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,450
or hecarim one of the snug pool which is

00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:11,210
seems it was huge based plant as we shed

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,760
a reach out script for matrix written in

00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,610
Python go nuts which is a command line

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,280
interface for a matrix written and go

00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:21,470
that's prytaneum which is prosecute

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,110
again the fractal I know you couldn't

00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,520
tell us the one guy who actually worked

00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:29,450
on Frank Levin to some don't know

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,400
project do you serve us yes II class

00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,080
with spray the spectral you mean the

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,690
date during the two clients for you but

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,360
a touch event was running that don't

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,350
know anyone who does but I love the fact

00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,660
that when you turn doing these things

00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:44,960
like this and I should mention also

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,490
there is a II project actually by the

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,920
matrix team themselves called palcohol

00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,800
Pat alignment at the moment because as

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,330
it turns out

00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,850
and then decryption is hard even though

00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,860
they have lighters for it so some guy

00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,090
wrote a proxy that can connect to major

00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,940
through your connect your mates to

00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,650
explain through it a little transparent

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,240
lead to go all the antenna crucial for

00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,190
you so you can run and tell literature

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,480
clients even if you're they don't need

00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:11,940
to report it but yeah I missed here to

00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:22,160
tell you the matrix you want to use this

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:22,160
it's becoming really popular right notes

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,890
yeah like I said I'm not part of the

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,990
core team I'm just a user and a bit of

00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,480
developer I've done some projects portal

00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,770
a ruby SDK have done upon integration of

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,170
the name how we're doing the kubernetes

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,510
packaging in order to actually keep our

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:55,440
branding that you can counter being on

00:41:39,510 --> 00:42:02,010
the matrix so we could we can't get

00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:04,800
managers on IRC very very when scaling

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,870
nice looking at all that and working on

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,390
the us so it's actually those plaintiffs

00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:11,580
actually really beautiful okay thanks I

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,440
should say also the French government is

00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,820
working on a plane that is supposed to

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,020
work for the French government so

00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,020
hopefully that also be

00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,440
[Applause]

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,119
you know this guy the poster Arthur says

00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,950
hey your software is full array but it

00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,619
has to fix these Hey or somebody's gonna

00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,990
really have to fix this other thing hey

00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,810
you so what is okay but if you need more

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:30,030
time with my hands of the s okay so

00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,860
what's up there is basically a really

00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:34,320
nice project on which say we try to

00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:37,590
figure out which have the most prevalent

00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,430
how risky or problematic security

00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:43,020
problems for web applications I mean I

00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,030
know that a lot of people here instead

00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,710
of either working and redevelopment

00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,710
Rachel cut if you'd have wrote them a

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:51,510
web application come on Thomas I raise

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:55,730
your hand if you keep your high price

00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:59,220
and if you have used PHP at some point

00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:01,800
and you probably know that PHP I mean

00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,840
the PHP documentation is really nice use

00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,890
the copy paste example six seven was not

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,840
gonna be pasting from a stack overflow

00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,710
if you don't want anybody to go into the

00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,810
kitchen so a display focuses on that

00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,790
then more like Commodore biggest

00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,490
mistakes they keep releasing new vessels

00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:21,030
this is for 2017 premiere one was for

00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:25,320
2013 so III forget you can expect an

00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:27,900
investment of the SA listing so well

00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,470
this is like the body morning

00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:33,059
with everything against the elements

00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,069
that you should take care of if you are

00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:37,380
doing web development at some point of

00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:39,750
time some of them might be taking care

00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,059
by your framework or less don't just

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:45,569
keep in mind that they exist so another

00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:47,609
one injections I mean Hasani of you a

00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:48,510
reduced SQL map or any other SQL

00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:50,430
injection tools

00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,859
come on the Messiah and all that hello W

00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:55,020
ha yeah so this is the most problematic

00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:57,329
issue because it usually allows you to

00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,619
climb the world data rates and fuel out

00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:03,180
at the uses that exist of the system in

00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:04,740
remote code execution that means that an

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,710
attacker can execute code into your

00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,450
service but you don't respect it so when

00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:13,049
you are mixing different languages for

00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:15,779
example creating SQL code from PHP you

00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:18,480
have to be very careful with Hanina that

00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:20,819
you get from users so let's go for

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,059
number to locate houghton indication I

00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:26,819
mean let's go break so coupe you has

00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:28,289
ever used try to visit slash admin and

00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:32,039
found that alpha solid they became

00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:33,720
administrators good you see this is a

00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,420
really really common problem are so so

00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,829
that's why it's not a - because most of

00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,200
the applications now handle

00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:43,140
authentication properly who of you has

00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,420
find out a cookie correct admin equal

00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,069
serum that you can just modify have

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,920
there become a myth that's another

00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:52,079
example so when you use authentication

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,819
systems I always try to use whatever

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,369
dual framework is providing because it's

00:45:53,819 --> 00:46:01,470
useful equal to sign well unless you try

00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:02,970
to copy goes from php.net but be very

00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,140
careful because you might find out that

00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,549
for example users might have

00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,950
earlier that you don't expect them to

00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:12,920
carry out and that can have impacts on

00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,940
your systems number three sensitive data

00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,329
expose you

00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,740
I'm going to sue manage this really fast

00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:22,369
1177 say I'm not going to say

00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:25,430
anything else so we're very careful not

00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:26,029
to get personal or that Asuman being

00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,640
examined

00:46:26,029 --> 00:46:29,720
easy to read I was required on the

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,720
application before accessing

00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:36,289
particularly sensitive data and I will

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:40,160
keep an eye on what of what the muck of

00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:42,589
your application looks like so not that

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,440
for external excellent entities this I

00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:49,569
know some idea because of course nobody

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,569
uses XML anymore we use the a-sun yeah

00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:56,329
so it will get if you get that excellent

00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,069
data from a user you should be really

00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,710
careful because it's a really advanced

00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:03,500
and complicated language and that means

00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,450
that you can for example includes XML

00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,190
documents from an external website that

00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:09,619
means that yourself in order to parse

00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:11,299
XML file will connect to a statement

00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:13,250
that this controller type that I can can

00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:15,589
take certain date and then well try to

00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,720
interpret it so you can end up with very

00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:20,690
different problems with when you have

00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,690
family XML so there is a very nice leap

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,420
XML version that tries to prevent the

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,299
system from any stroke I always call you

00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:32,210
you say the XML library you want web

00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:34,220
application try to restrict at the

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:37,640
maximum what they what make cement

00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:40,089
features you alone I always use a DTD to

00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,250
reduce the risk of this kind of problems

00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:44,960
broken access control so we will talk

00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,269
about Roca notification

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,009
yeah we usually talk about their

00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:51,650
progress with how you handle for example

00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:53,210
some things i thinkit's and so on and in

00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,369
grow can access culturally smaller

00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,099
take a site owner would have me they are

00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:59,599
kept as two different issues because one

00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:01,759
thing is usually preventing the user

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,170
from accessing your system and another

00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:07,430
thing is making sure that the user is

00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:09,100
who seems to me to store as you can see

00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,810
many Republicans

00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,670
so this is usually the first thing you

00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,610
want to test when you want to look for

00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,230
security vulnerabilities security

00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,010
miscalculation this is something

00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,680
wonderful

00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:23,740
I mean raise your hand if you have ever

00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,110
deployed an application just with the

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:29,650
default settings you can't remove this

00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,690
troll or for an application itself come

00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,130
on really so little people I know that

00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:36,580
none of the people is inside - raise

00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,590
your pants so as you can see as you

00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,990
probably know not at which the security

00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,750
results that you're getting your when

00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:46,480
web applications in your service your

00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:48,010
frameworks are the best ones so if you

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,120
have a little bit of application I

00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:53,530
always considered interesting well a 5%

00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,090
of youth and at the end of the project

00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,800
to make sure that you do can deploy

00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,170
mints and that the configuration you set

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,910
up is the strongest one because

00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,040
otherwise you might hide that for

00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,840
example I have a confused on great and

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,330
technicians from the abusers to an

00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,980
encrypted protocol and then mess up with

00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:12,130
the way that they are sending just to

00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:14,470
give an example let's go for cross-site

00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:16,210
scripting is used to be number one now

00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,970
it's no longer number one I get that is

00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,950
because people don't use PHP so much man

00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,990
it is because nowadays we are using a

00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,790
lot of templating engines so that means

00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,460
that you serve it I shall escape it

00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:28,420
automatically before you cook it and

00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,980
that's the only one of the best

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,010
solutions to these kind of problems

00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:35,710
whenever you are can incubate and put it

00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:38,380
in am putting it into an HTML file you

00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:42,610
have to make sure I wish to escape the

00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:44,200
reader properly a is insecure the

00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:49,090
survivor system any of you familiar with

00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:52,810
Python any of you has tried to serialize

00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:54,820
Python objects before and it use

00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,680
unaware that soothsay realize that

00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,930
objects actually can lead to remote code

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,340
execution

00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:01,810
ok now you be really careful when you

00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,350
materialized

00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:07,620
what was

00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,940
well Python objects and it's a similar

00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,280
problem with Jana and some other

00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,000
protocols so it's really important that

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,860
if you get any sterilized data back the

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,810
authenticate that is correct that it has

00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,640
nothing with if you're sending

00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:24,360
serialized data consider who is having

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,370
her strong-ass of the waiter with a key

00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,920
that we only know so that normally are

00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:32,250
modified and then gave you in one name

00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,630
and in content that wrestle but for

00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,120
example when you are interacting with

00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:38,310
payment platforms what you get data from

00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:40,890
the bank that you that the user has to

00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:42,930
send you instead of being sent directly

00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,640
from the bath that's one of the base

00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:50,460
what I have for most brothers in this

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:52,770
attic is components with a normal

00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,320
abilities raise your hands if you have

00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:58,020
had a web application that you develop

00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:02,280
it more than five years ago and you know

00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,990
is being used and you have a debate so

00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,120
you know that why this is a problem I

00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:08,130
mean in certain words a lot of people go

00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,800
to stack overflow to use copy paste a

00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:13,080
improves that they get for the solution

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,210
I love them in sector they are using the

00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,830
last bastion of the library so then you

00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,860
go to temperate miss the best and you

00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:22,110
are like okay so well you see these

00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,150
think whatever still you are using yeah

00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:28,140
it has like five different places of

00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:30,690
site scripting so this is a serious

00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,520
issue and the last one is insouciant

00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,910
going and monitoring and this is not a

00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,380
security vulnerability but it's a risk

00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:39,180
when an attacker gets into your system

00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,640
and the attacking managers to up

00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,680
the wulfing you want to catch somebody

00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,380
and you want that person to opera login

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,000
so he can come back and tell you hey so

00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,530
that I can basically found out that you

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,080
were using a really old version of

00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:54,180
jQuery or pH before or whatever and

00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,310
that's how they manage to get into your

00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,660
system so you can actually act on it and

00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:00,570
you can prevent this from happening

00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,490
again and then here in detect that that

00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:05,400
is going on so you can stop it before

00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:08,120
it's problematic so this is the worst of

00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,120
them awesome

00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,850
[Applause]
