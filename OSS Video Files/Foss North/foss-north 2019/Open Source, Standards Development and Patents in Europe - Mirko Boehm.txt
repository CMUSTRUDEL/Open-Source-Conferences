Title: Open Source, Standards Development and Patents in Europe - Mirko Boehm
Publication date: 2019-04-17
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	The standards community develops specifications. The FOSS community implements standards. The FOSS community also develops industry standards. How does this the interaction function? And is it working well? How do policy makers interact with the FOSS community to set safety standards and other requirements? What is the relationship between standards-essential patents and FOSS? What comes first, specification or implementation? Where does innovation happen, and what is the platform to develop consensus on technical standards in a market segment? Based on research work at TU Berlin and for the Joint Research Center of the European Commission and the work of the Open Invention Network to protect key FOSS projects from patent litigation, the presentation will discuss the current state of the debate at the European and international level, and provide an outlook on how the roles and functions of standards-development organisations and the wider FOSS community are converging. No live demos, unfortunately.

so yeah thanks for this invitation thank

00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,950
celebrity to speak and thanks to all of

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,060
you for coming here

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:28,310
I'm Merkel boom I represent the

00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,160
invention Network which is a patent pool

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,290
that protects the Epson and other key

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,270
three you know software technologies

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,000
from patent litigation through

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,860
cross-licensing many how many companies

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,239
are part of our network basically when

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,100
you're in the network your

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,230
cross-licensing your patent portfolio to

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,269
learners in a network and that very

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,489
effectively suppresses all sorts of

00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:52,040
patent litigation so if you have a

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,720
wondering why we have almost absolutely

00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,610
no patent litigation when it comes to

00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,190
the kernel and to see library etc I

00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:02,510
think we're one part of that however

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,070
since I already you presented about this

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,510
three years ago and at least a few of

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:09,650
you were there I'm not going into more

00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,470
detail here um I think it's such a good

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,110
to to open for North worth a topic that

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,420
is clearly related to freedoms of

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,799
software but also slightly on the fringe

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,039
and involves well they're not technical

00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,079
aspects of our community because they

00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:30,890
ask into the room who of you has ever

00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,460
have to deal with patent open source to

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,399
three boys standardization standards

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,329
development one two three four a little

00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,340
more but you see this is a topic that

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:45,350
touches what we do it interacts very

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,179
strongly with what we do and when you

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,679
imagine yourself in a position of a

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:50,689
policy maker in Brussels for the

00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:52,579
European Union then you realize that

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,530
this is one of the the questions that

00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,020
they're asking themself is what do we do

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,429
with these different ways of managing

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,319
innovation because that's essentially

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:06,409
what it is it's a different difficult

00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,240
topic to cetacean I wanted to begin with

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,649
giving you and giving you a collection

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,650
of surprised you listed mission

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:17,630
statements just so that you see that

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,500
actually the problem is weird in a way

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,160
so I saw y'all know I saw or itd

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
International Organization for

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,220
Standardization

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,110
which is not an abbreviation myself it's

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,460
actually the Greek word for equal you

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,640
might have done so the name of the

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,320
organization is not the variation in

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,840
equity so faisal brings together experts

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,950
to share knowledge and develop voluntary

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,180
consensus based market relevant

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,520
international standards that support

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,550
innovation and provide solutions to

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:48,350
global challenges beautiful mission

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:50,690
right he's a typical representative of

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,070
TD free no source Africa beauty deluxe

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,050
relations indicated to building

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,730
sustainable ecosystems round up source

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,210
projects to accelerate technology

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:03,860
development and Industry adoption

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:05,240
wonderful the European Patent Office all

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,980
right so it's the mission of the

00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,450
European Patent Office is to support

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,040
innovation competitiveness and economic

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,490
growth for the benefit of the citizens

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,490
of Europe

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,480
try to ask yourself why could there

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,819
possibly be any sort of discord between

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,650
these groups they all want the same

00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:29,390
right they all wonder in the end it was

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:32,200
probably good in might they say so

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,190
there's some tension the years of course

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,440
there's an organization that represents

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,930
major intellectual property holds

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,200
popcorn accompanies IP for a party

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,549
council and one quote from recent

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,079
publication is one solution to the

00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,180
concerns raised about the

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,060
incompatibility between standards

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,940
organizations in turn fair reasonable

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,209
and non-discriminatory PAP licensing

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,180
conditions is for friend based as do

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,670
substandard local organizations to amend

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,799
relevant open-source licenses to ensure

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,940
that they are compatible with the stos

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,849
intellectual property rights policies if

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,299
you come from a background in the wider

00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:20,000
social media like I do that sounds it

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:22,190
horribly offensive to Iran and here's

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,229
the response from simon phipps of source

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,789
initiative this is basically for the two

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,260
weeks old

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:28,639
to maintain the legal compatibility of

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,620
open source licenses with royalty

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,740
bearing patents in standard just beside

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,010
the point one needs to either use a reel

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,450
or source project or risk that no one

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,560
shows up apart from sanitizers some tips

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,240
so you see there's quite some tension

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,449
these both these publications are not

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,760
hotel I think from this year and there's

00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,110
an ongoing study on the interaction

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,849
between open source software and friend

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,500
licensing and sanitization at the joint

00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:57,770
research center European Commission and

00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,340
I'm working on the study so together

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,599
with researchers from tu Berlin at so

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,300
basically this is what I want to talk

00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:08,270
about today distension because we're

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,979
we're experiencing a new round of what

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,930
you might recall as the software patents

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,970
debate from nothing's with almost fifty

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,919
years ago now right roughly two thousand

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,800
five familiar boats going down the river

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,120
in Brussels with billboards on them

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,390
saying no software patents

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,370
does anybody remember that you should

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,470
look it up and someone I

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:32,350
to be spectacular and the software

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,690
patents debate has it mostly because

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,710
it's not a super popular topic that's

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,560
very dry it's passed an economic policy

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,389
and stuff like that so it's not

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,370
something it gets a lot of like this

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,720
super enthusiastic which is why I

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,229
brought it in a little bit so that you

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,060
see this is relevant so it so what is

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,500
the interest in the subject I mean if we

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,080
would say okay does tension let me go

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,240
here's a quote from the European

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,050
Commission's communication on the role

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,039
of stem essential patents in in Europe

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,630
where they say integration between

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,190
open-source projects and status

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,280
development processes is a win-win

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,690
situation on one side develop source of

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,639
salvation can speed up the status

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,680
development process and the take-up of

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,539
ICT standards especially for Hermes and

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,490
on the other side extenders can provide

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:24,010
for interoperability books or software

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,330
permutations so this is a policy

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,070
statement that you know how long it

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,200
takes to write a policy statement right

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,660
so if the European Commission in 2017

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,570
put this out you can imagine that

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,190
there's a lot of pressure to actually

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,310
establish collaborations between

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,169
standards of open organizations and at a

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,020
divided source community which

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,150
automatically brings in the question of

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,460
patterns etc because many of the

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,919
participants in tennis development hold

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,389
portfolios of patents agreed on the

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,270
standards that are being developed these

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:59,770
are forward standards in Japan so dad um

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,930
it's also an underlying reason which I

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,449
like to say in this room and that is

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,460
that the oxwas community in general out

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,740
innovates and all collaborate the

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,870
standards development organizations I'll

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,820
show you some numbers later were about

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,830
like how many participants we have

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,660
someone in some of the larger projects

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,070
and it dwarfs literally Dwarfs even the

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,960
larger collaborations as far as

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,760
organizations so you may have like a

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,890
hundred participants there or a couple

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,400
hundred and you may have ten thousand in

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:33,220
a large open source project so there are

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,840
some plain official reasons why we would

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,510
like the sequel operation but it's also

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,300
like a puzzle facing finally so much

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,330
faster than we are so completely

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:48,040
congratulations to all of you for doing

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:49,090
that so they did two essential part of

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,110
the presentation distance all

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,550
introduction one is about this we're

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,590
just starting University in your

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,660
technique invested Berlin and the second

00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,980
part is about the study of the doing for

00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,480
a joint research centre which are two

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,950
separate things here we first looked at

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,660
but if we assume that there's this

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,190
tension where does it come from

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,800
shouldn't they be partners I mean that's

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,770
what you would expect from the idea

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,960
state commission statements but maybe

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,670
because the new institutions and

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,380
essentially a competition between these

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,910
situations for relevance right

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,710
maybe that competitors maybe they

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,330
displace each other in some parts that

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,820
creates attention so we try to answer

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,700
this question and the first thing we ran

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,410
into was this upon antiquated view of

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,820
standard and this again sounds very

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,860
offensive to the standards development

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,680
people because that's their definition

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,840
of stuff it's even there's even a

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,870
standard on this so there's a standard

00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,990
and safe understand of this it's the

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:49,090
iso/iec guide to 2004 and it's a

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,310
standard is a document established by

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:54,490
consensus and proof by a recognized body

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,500
recognizes upon here that provides for

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,650
comment will be use rules guidelines of

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,950
characteristics mm-hm end at the

00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,690
achieving optimum degree of order in a

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,550
given context survey genero you put a

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,700
couple of key terms in this one is

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:13,510
document this is called the document

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:17,220
centric view standards it's a piece of

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:20,530
paper or PDF you know you can print it

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,410
established by consensus means as a

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:26,760
dictate age-old question of consensus

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:30,560
e/m of a who and who's involved and

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,620
young question of who's in and who's out

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,420
approved by recognized body now you need

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,980
understand you that recognize bodies are

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,840
recognized standards development

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,620
organizations so for example some of

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,170
them are recognized by the Yuki Union or

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,910
some national standards organizations in

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,190
every country that are regularly

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,620
recognized by the local governments so

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,120
basically this defines a standard system

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,200
that is what standards development

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,210
organizations produce what you all do is

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,360
not standardization even if you achieve

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,730
massive standardization in a sense that

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,680
that say we produce an operating system

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,029
that runs on 99.9 percent of the

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,410
computers in the world which is the

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,630
definition of standardization right

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,160
you're not doing standardization because

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,080
you know produce a document that is

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,190
approved by consensus and by a

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,839
recognised body so we said yeah yeah

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,250
that that might be true and maybe in the

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,480
seventies some some committee got

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,370
together with this docket this

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,350
definition into an ISO standard this

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,900
doesn't explain how the freedoms of

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,420
software community develops software

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,000
content develops this into a standard so

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,400
we need a better way so we developed

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,220
this this Court has done is a phase

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,330
model is basically a view at anomic view

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,339
of Spawn standardization where we say

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:52,220
segmentation is a process in society

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,170
that starts with a need for

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,450
Standardization so we perceive for

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,770
example of our pluck support locks on

00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,970
our computers they don't fit into the

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,580
other computers so there's a need for

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,030
standardization and we are looking for a

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,290
technical solution to fulfill that and

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,540
actually we don't care necessarily if

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,250
that's defined by stem as development

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,980
organizations overthought laptop

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,540
manufacturers get together and just

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,010
agree on whether production of light

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,110
right we say if the result is that my

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,020
laptop charger can plug into your laptop

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,600
to charge we have achieved a standard so

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,959
that's the need and then the adoption of

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,029
a standard and to get from A to B we

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,010
apply as sort of a sanitation instrument

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:40,370
which is something that causes of

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:43,430
standardizing effect and this may sound

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:46,650
totally logical but it's very

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,720
much against the going theory in

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,030
simulation especially a sense of open

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,890
operations involved especially because

00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,190
we define the whole thing as a process

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,120
the process has four phases ideation is

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,770
where you find possible standards

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,060
basically this is this exploration phase

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,200
where you're like they're different

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,150
open-source communities they're

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,490
competing over everybody starts a

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,540
project don't take photos yet anymore

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,990
everybody starts a project and I

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,920
probably five IOT frameworks at the

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,290
moment per me and yes but there will be

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,090
a hashing out process so over time we

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,800
will this will reduced as well a kind of

00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,320
like a good sauce so I had cups and then

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,930
introduced us to what is really good and

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,400
then you may have to and that's when the

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,340
standards begin to develop and then you

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,910
ask yourself a question do we create a

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,650
specification or do we implement and

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,540
what which of these two do we do first

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,710
because if you want an interoperable

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,050
framework you probably need

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,820
documentation there is a very very

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,600
interesting talk of documentation later

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,100
today that you want to hear and and

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,360
that's basically the specification of

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,950
the technology if you want to achieve

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,040
interoperability if you want to achieve

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,060
an option with within other communities

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,460
that you don't have a personal

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,360
connection to you need specification so

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,740
you may say okay so now we have we have

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,320
the cycle of what the standard should be

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,000
let's write a specification so that we

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,550
can then have multiple entirely

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,860
compatible implementations that then

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,040
lead to diffusion in the market make

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,810
sense does it select a classical way of

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,450
thinking about standardization if you

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,160
will because you can easily imagine this

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,610
not being necessary done an open source

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,490
community but in a working group and

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:35,280
sense Emily saying let's define Davi

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,580
warranty frameworks and then the

00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,390
communities can go in and implement them

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,250
but that'sthat's actually very

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,370
compatible only doubt today you see that

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,990
even a specification part is sometimes

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,100
done with

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,960
social media so we don't necessarily

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,980
resort to standards development

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,900
organizations we do this ourselves

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,550
but you need all four phases if you see

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,380
that already right you need to come up

00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,580
with the entire you need to specify get

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,710
implemented and then you can reach

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,060
diffusion to market this is also

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,790
possible it's basically the exact

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,010
opposite approach is to say we have this

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,750
idea but we don't want to specify it in

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,180
the start from the start because if we

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,680
do that then work would be stopping

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,540
innovation at this point because as soon

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,330
as you have described how things should

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,580
work it's difficult to change our work

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,350
so let's continue implementing let's

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,110
write more code let's get more

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,330
functionality in and wait for adoption

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,430
in the industry and when things have

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,410
hashed out really well then we write a

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,560
specification so you implement first and

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,780
then you specify and this is more in

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,880
line with how the how do you field for

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,010
software community develops right we

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,870
need to typically lead by implementation

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:46,100
but we don't necessarily write

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:48,320
specifications first well naturally this

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,120
is like theory but it means this model

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,100
explains the processes of Stenness

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,990
development organization and also us

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,060
communities in the same model which is

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,550
the old definition of a standard as a

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,920
document written by us do didn't really

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:06,350
do in real life it looks more messy like

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,960
this so for multiple reasons first of

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,790
all it's not a linear process its

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,020
repetitive so you make a first version

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,840
and then you go back and make another

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,310
version and the old specification you

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,410
throw away you do it again in the more

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,540
standards current world you often have

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,760
situations where vendors or when you

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,850
create products who understand a sense

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,350
development process is still ongoing for

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,150
the reason sometimes because you want to

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,090
be able to use products in the market at

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,350
the time of stem that is published you

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:40,310
see this with you speed you saw that

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,870
with some video connectors I think HDMI

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,930
was one of them it was like intermediate

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,650
phase of incompatible implementations

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,650
that that wouldn't fix

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:54,249
and some others so it's actually this is

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,109
probably the most common the parallel

00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:59,199
approach to to standardization is most

00:15:56,109 --> 00:16:02,319
common in real life but the other two

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:06,249
are illustrative for understanding how

00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:07,839
this environment really works yeah so we

00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:10,629
said okay so this is a fixed model but

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,290
now we have to can analyze D D to real

00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,609
situation in the ICT sector and we came

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,949
up with this process which is a

00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:21,040
comparative SWOT analysis who is sort of

00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,359
swamp before that's been popular like

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,759
strengths weaknesses opportunities and

00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:26,679
threats when you learned about it where

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,129
you told that you can't compare SWOT

00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,129
analysis

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,980
it's not knowing if it's the keystone of

00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:39,999
the theory of SWAT I said it's an

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:43,209
analysis of a specific situation used to

00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,589
derive recommendations for actions but

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:47,139
you can't compare one to the other

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:48,879
because all the four segments of the

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,410
announcers are separate different from

00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,809
each other has no connection between two

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,279
separate points but here's what we did

00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:59,049
we said oh source communities absence of

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,629
open all organizations in the ICT sector

00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:04,059
operate against the same opportunities

00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:07,240
threats they operate in the same market

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:10,209
so if you do that you anchor these two

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,000
separate analysis together which I try

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:17,730
to very nicely visualize this way and

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,350
this leads to super interesting results

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,870
actually surprising I think the you will

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,939
see so the first thing that we did based

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,470
on that as we did two separate analysis

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:27,909
put them together and said what is if

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,039
you condensed your opportunities and

00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:31,870
threats in the ICT sector what comes out

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,120
of that this is super relevant to you

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,919
because this is the the sector it of

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,740
space that you work in as your business

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,019
operates in so let's see there are two

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,750
key changes this is not surprising right

00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:46,210
there is digitization and globalization

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:51,370
then really really change how our sector

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:54,850
works and we brought it down to four

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,510
essential changes that really change our

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,770
environment

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,830
one is that we created

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,210
much improved methods of collaboration

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,010
we all know that because we come from an

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,800
open-source background but if you want

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:11,690
to see how drastic this changes think

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,220
back just a few years mid 10 B 12 when

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,520
you were still order books with

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,680
specifications many of you still do that

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,470
the ones look like me have gray hair me

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,480
over a minute there was a time before

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:29,370
PDFs were available for everything

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:32,490
alright that's not too long ago we can

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:37,050
coordinate development work with online

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:38,520
tools globally and what today feels just

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,710
like a really fun way to develop

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,990
software was revolutionary maybe 10

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,300
years ago and it was pioneered by your

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,460
source community I mean the first like

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,160
online bug trackers that were fully

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,510
available in an online repositories were

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,340
hosted by open source communities so and

00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:00,270
this changes a lot because many of our

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,230
institutions that we're relying on for

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,910
example standards development

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,280
organizations they were designed around

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,100
the fact that collaboration is difficult

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,690
and time-consuming so it's a they were

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,490
designed in a way for example that you

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,110
establish a working group that means

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,690
twice a year because that was the most

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,410
efficient way at the time for different

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,810
industry stakeholders etc to collaborate

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,430
and agitators feels outdated to us would

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,950
we have to keep in mind that this wasn't

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,680
too long ago right the Internet as such

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,380
and an online documents that we can

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,540
collaboratively edit that's not the last

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,010
decade right the food people are

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,140
actually printing meeting minutes and

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,520
sending about by mail still and you

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,240
might still find some organization to do

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,990
that today so it's not yeah that was

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,210
part 1.2 is a a general trend towards

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,440
openness and transparency this is like

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,940
preaching to the choir because we're

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
sitting here than freedom for software

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,100
conference but it has become pretty

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,720
natural to us that we expect if somebody

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,240
introduces a product we expect to say

00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,950
between to see the source code if

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,640
somebody comes to some sort of agreement

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,350
of

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,930
which technical direction we should take

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,370
we totally expect that the process how

00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,320
this agreement was reached is not

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,640
amended somewhere maybe that the meeting

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,960
minutes are available maybe that

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,700
actually does it should be the

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,580
discussion happens on IRC in the lots of

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,040
up in the available if you would ask

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,510
this maybe 10-15 years ago you would get

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,040
a lot of blank stares because people say

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,230
how many can you how can you discuss

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,300
like that right if everybody can keep

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,070
going to groovy you small group and they

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,380
need to reach a consensus ideal in your

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,850
back room so that I can like pay off two

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,140
of these people and the other one I

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,560
write for dinner and then I get my

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,210
opinion room right and this is a change

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,090
that we don't just see in technology we

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,850
also see the state politics in education

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,810
in many other places but it's definitely

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,670
apparent in the ICT sector so for

00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,260
example it was a very cozy relationship

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,410
between especially standards different

00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,000
organizations and regulators where you

00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,640
develop a standard and descenders then

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,140
basically imposed us a safety regulation

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,820
so you say you have to be at least

00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,120
according to the standard to be able to

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,460
sell this fine as long as the standard

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,990
is open but if it's a closed standard of

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,330
proprietors and there were a standard

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,830
that involves pants that cover it then

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,220
you basically create a license to print

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:21,730
money right and then this happened and

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,440
this trend works against is where we

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,260
increasingly expect to be able to

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,060
reproduce in a way how certain decisions

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,350
are made who took part in that decision

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,330
where you expect that if there's an

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,530
organization how can I become part of

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,230
the organization should be public and

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:37,120
transparent what is my role as a

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,120
contributor to have the same rights as

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,539
somebody else etc remember for example

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,429
how long disappearance

00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,499
computer license agreements contributor

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,570
license agreements have become much less

00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:50,039
popular recently because they created

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,459
asymmetric situations between

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:56,449
contributors that we think we

00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:58,320
intuitively feel are against this trend

00:21:56,449 --> 00:22:01,019
you can look to something lots of

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,539
debates about this then there is a a

00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:06,389
third aspect this is all based on

00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,489
digitization this is the a shift of

00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:10,320
relevance from from national to super

00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:13,139
international collaboration regulation

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,699
this basically is how we work right you

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:17,909
don't care if your contributors come

00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:19,409
from Asia or South America or Europe as

00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:22,109
long as somebody submits a good patch

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:26,579
we're happy about it but it's a big

00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:28,199
change because the example is tennis

00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,539
development world is organized in

00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:32,789
national standards bodies that form a

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:34,769
hierarchy that there are some European

00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,849
ones then there's the International

00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:38,159
Organization for Standardization

00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:40,139
darkened it integrates that but it's

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,899
very much based on national borders

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:44,899
still today yes of the collaboration

00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:47,579
between these organizations but they're

00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:50,929
new basically built like the old world

00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:53,909
order we're still set up the same way so

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:55,940
this is shift towards producing this

00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:59,579
kind of redundancy and in developing

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:02,399
technical decisions or ways to

00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:04,379
collaborate and this of course threatens

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:07,289
the institutions that we have because if

00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:09,389
you say why should I have like 25

00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,639
national standards organizations in the

00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:13,289
European Union or you see a lot of

00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:18,989
people going scared because they're five

00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:20,819
years to retirement and then the last

00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:22,679
one this is super interesting and you

00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,979
may disagree with this because I didn't

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,940
invent it there's a shift in the role of

00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:31,649
the modern state states we live in where

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,169
not too long ago the state must need to

00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,959
put use of goods it ran the rail

00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:40,139
services did runs education in most

00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:43,319
places still it controlled most of the

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:44,850
agricultural production etc etc and this

00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:48,240
is changing it is

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:51,980
more of regulator and a coordinator and

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,870
not a producer and you can tell why in

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,690
European states especially if you were a

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:01,260
few people employed by the state and

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,510
actual production functions and this is

00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,190
a trend that was actually identified and

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,990
formulated by a by shaktibabu

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,300
and you got a Nobel Prize for it a

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,190
couple years ago so I claim proof Bible

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,850
for TV his pocket would you disagree

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,850
with me on this one

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,530
but this is an important change because

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,820
if you think about how taking the

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,790
decision son for example technical

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,490
investments were made in the past a lot

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,350
of them were made by the state which

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,210
telecommunications network we run almost

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,500
all telecoms operators in the past are

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:37,080
operated by the state and owned by the

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:40,080
state wideness changes today and as this

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,850
all these these four trends together um

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,460
are the the changes the massive trends

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,170
that influence how actors in the ICT

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,030
sector

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,770
well basically adopt to the environment

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,900
and this includes the open source

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,670
committee and standards development

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,130
organization so next step naturally

00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:01,080
worse to say so if in this environment

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,580
against these trends what are the

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,010
strengths and weaknesses of the wild

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,600
sauce community when I say the wide open

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,370
source community what this means is the

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,170
the whole upstream downstream Network

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,510
right from the kernel develop over into

00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:15,830
the user with all the thousands of

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:18,000
relationships in between all communities

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,290
it's not surprising what came out of

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,970
strengths what we wrote this article

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,560
lost a little bit to document this for

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,480
the stem cell of an organization so it's

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,940
a rapid prototyping we have tons of

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,560
projects that started saying civilized

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,410
years different programming languages

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,020
different permutation approaches

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:36,240
different acting funding different

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,810
experience levels and then some of these

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,970
start to to condense and start to become

00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,170
larger and bigger

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,920
another the strength of us

00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:48,840
because we weed out non feasible

00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,390
technical solutions in a very early

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,580
stage but somebody has this great idea

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,440
after the 1320 gonna begin start

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,780
something that one day realizes man

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,620
maybe it wasn't that good but how do I

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,210
get rid of that - - and then I stop the

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,700
project and then you have another

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,080
project a continuous and this this is

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,090
really a strike for this combines

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,330
where's the release very agrees often

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:14,970
bother we make our changes available to

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,710
world pretty much on when we finished

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,440
and we push your changes to github do we

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,060
little to everybody and then that

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,760
creates this kind of supports this

00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,750
collaboration model it is trained to

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,450
open it et cetera

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,190
we have voluntary participation this by

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,460
the way is one of the Keystone's again

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,490
of how hose works because you can't

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,650
force anybody to work on your project so

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,570
you have two things that this means one

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,420
is your party needs to be technically

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,530
interesting promising right people need

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,880
to have a feeling that if they

00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,340
contribute to your project that they

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,000
will be why they're able to solve their

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:55,080
technical pose really well or become

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,760
famous or not but as this is also a

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,220
question related to governance in your

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,840
community basically in plain terms if

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,300
the people that run the community act

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,990
like dicks other people won't join and

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,420
that's good all right it's a regulator

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,830
on our community and how it behaves and

00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,990
I think it was one of the reasons why in

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,790
general the over source communities

00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,250
actually are welcoming to people that

00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,230
are just interested in contributing we

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,610
also have to keep in mind and this is

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,060
one of the weaknesses that I will talk

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:26,910
about later that there might be some

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,620
bias in this industry participation and

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,810
then what are our key strengths I think

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,010
is the upstream downstream order does

00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,450
everybody understand what this term

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,500
means

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:43,360
before we're said before I think it is

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:45,590
good um essentially there is an

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,180
unimaginable amount of relationships

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,340
between contributors and users and

00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,700
abusers and other communities that use

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:56,210
your code change in integrated again etc

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,920
and if any of them would require a sort

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,020
of negotiation where you say I need to

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,840
call that guy from the other community

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,970
to see if they can use our pro

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,530
everything would break down immediately

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,500
right because we have an entering

00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,210
relationship in faculty relationships

00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,060
are totally you just don't have that

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,340
many phone lines to sort this out right

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,020
and every every licensed relationship in

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,430
this portal is automatic we know that

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,770
right all the source licenses mean I

00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,050
offer you accept done we don't have to

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,550
have a talk to each other and this is a

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,800
huge change because it enables

00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,860
collaboration at a skill that was

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,220
possible before yeah what we also have

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,710
weaknesses might be hard to hear but yes

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,880
we do we have a strong weakness in

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,560
supply chain management

00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,050
this might not be something that is

00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,840
super visible at the level of individual

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:48,260
community but if you look at recent

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:51,010
projects like the open chain project if

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,900
you look at what the SPX community does

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,670
they're trying to define busy P Beckham

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,220
editions for how to manage supply chain

00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,980
in a sense of large Co deliveries from

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,450
one entity to the next that include

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,910
combination of free software and

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,400
proprietary software and there's a lot

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,380
of unknown work of this at the time that

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,770
now which means this is an unsolved

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,950
problem we have a huge issue with Isis

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,400
compliance I'm not sure if this is also

00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,600
something that at their level of

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,200
people that contribute to the quarters

00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,450
be visible it's also a sign of success

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,790
because it happens to be a problem

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:32,010
because we have so much adoption of what

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:33,810
we create but there are projects I've

00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,480
know here but clearly defined to that

00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,850
online repository of identifying the the

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,320
licenses of old components that were

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:45,990
using or maybe to maintain as a mom yet

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,470
there are multiple projects to devote to

00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,810
Ling to document compliance to worry or

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:56,850
to document how soft pretended or one

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:59,550
you produce it to the next etc and this

00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,500
is a legal issue or an eagle due process

00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,760
issues not technical and then we have a

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,110
very limited understanding of

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,840
meritocracy and this is harsh I know

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,940
because we understand where autocracy as

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,710
a positive thing in the free software

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,110
community right have you heard of

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:20,340
determinacy do you consider it like a

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:24,260
basic tenet of how we work yeah good do

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,260
you realize that meritocracies is super

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:33,750
before word controversial Journal yeah

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,760
because we're chakra sea has a massive

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,440
selection bias

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,010
it basically means if you fit into the

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,630
group you can contribute if you can't

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,370
not because you can't write code but

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:47,480
maybe you speak a different language or

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:50,160
maybe you want to focus on documentation

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,560
then you don't aim it don't earn enough

00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,750
merit in the organization to ever become

00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,390
an influential person in the group and

00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,370
this is why all our software engineers

00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,820
in the old source community you don't

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:08,670
quite have well-educated male including

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:10,380
me so yeah um meritocracy we understand

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,240
as everyone should be measured against

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,070
the quality of their contributions but

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,620
we measure the contributions that our

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,740
code a lot higher than the rest of the

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,890
contributions organizing a conference

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,800
yeah thank you you are writing

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,140
documentation sorting out legal issues

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,550
mentoring new developers without ever

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,020
committing any caught yourself but

00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,420
helping 10 other people to join your

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,100
community these are all invisible tasks

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,600
that never show up in you get lost and

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,670
then people look at their kids dance and

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,100
say my key contributors are these five

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:45,210
developers this is not a limited

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,940
understanding of meritocracy so doctor

00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,320
that's not supposed to sound blue and I

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,270
think it's just natural that we should

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,240
also have precursors right so work on it

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,920
make it better and the others have

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,550
strengths weaknesses too so we should

00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,340
feel bad about it actually it might

00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,720
sound strange from our perspective but

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,120
standard-setting organizations that he

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,000
has tablished and powerful and actually

00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,650
useful institutions they have processes

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,720
that have developed over a long period

00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:15,270
of time and for example they have gone

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,640
through all the clearing of for example

00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,280
if I collaborate with my competitors is

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,500
this collusion to enter trust

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,780
authorities actually worry about us

00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,320
collaborating or maybe controlling the

00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,420
market and they develop processes and

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,880
negotiated with antitrust watchdogs to

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,590
make sure that business develop frames

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,190
of reference to say is if you do it this

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,050
way

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,490
and this transparent and we document

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,270
what we do this way if we're open for

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:44,310
participation then it's okay and that's

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,680
something that we don't have right is

00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,900
that any of you ever discussed antitrust

00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,260
concerns we see local regulators force

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,060
development no it's actually being

00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,080
discussed and antitrust regulators

00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,910
because we have such strong

00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,140
collaboration between all market vectors

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,620
so we have collusion

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,020
the question is is it anti-competitive

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,710
they have proved very well the point

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,840
policies for intellectual property

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,320
rights management that is as always a

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,070
German be here legally but it exists

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,340
copyright exists trademark exists

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:19,149
parents exist and we have a good way to

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,070
manage to copyright narco

00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:24,719
relationships between all contributors

00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,889
the communities users etc but we

00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:29,469
comparatively were kind of in the kids

00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:32,529
food still when it comes to every other

00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:35,019
thing though reach of Senators an

00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:36,940
organization is massive I don't know how

00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:39,940
it is it sweep but in Germany if you are

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,339
a manufacturer of any technical good you

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,619
are member of team it's normal right

00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:45,700
this is where you learned about taking

00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,899
to the palate prints this is where

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,700
collaborate with others so basically

00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,619
they manage the whole industry but there

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,169
one of the key collaborators and that's

00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:56,799
why Devlin didn't act much more than we

00:33:53,169 --> 00:34:01,029
have because we have impact very locally

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,669
a lot in our software sector in the

00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:05,979
sectors that we working but how do you

00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,419
reach machining companies how do you

00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:09,129
make sure that machining companies

00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:11,500
standard is actually operated with the

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,720
copyright because they're not coming to

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,899
this conference any machine machining

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,270
company in the room proves my point

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:20,500
okay they also have weaknesses there

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,569
something is really funny it's called

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,520
the standards development habitus right

00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:28,179
I talked earlier about five years of

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,879
retirement basically public servants

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,679
their administrators people that engage

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,049
in open source communities are usually

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,520
enthusiastic about writing code right

00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:39,190
that's why a year you're not here

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,720
because you want to talk about BIOS and

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:45,129
statutes and stuff like that

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,409
and it's really different there because

00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:48,819
the people that make a career out of

00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,049
working in these organizations they're

00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:51,940
not they're not working on ticket

00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:53,500
projects anymore they're working on

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,659
running the organization organization

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,059
becomes important in itself and it

00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,480
becomes a good way to oh no any

00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:04,839
retirement so which makes them a good

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,000
self in short they have a bit and B use

00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:11,920
IP our policies anybody here from a

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,470
telecommunications company okay so for

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,650
example we talk about this friend idea

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,059
early on

00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,910
standard-setting organizations

00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:23,109
requirement model in many cases

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,119
participants to commit to such

00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:26,880
conditions why they don't say what the

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,100
conditions are they say this should

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,680
negotiated in the market in contracts or

00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,810
maybe in court which is we encourage you

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,370
correctly you acquire a commitment but

00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,650
it's a commitment because it's not clear

00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,840
what you committed to and this is a big

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,340
use this is a weakness and that we see

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,410
that for example in telecommunication

00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,270
space and how it interacts with the free

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,120
software community the processes are

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,590
cumbersome well annotated explain this

00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:53,250
and there's some outdated business

00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,960
models like still today in ISIL he does

00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,000
the ISO store and you can select your

00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,070
credit card and buy a copy of the C++

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,990
standard may be done to C++ developers

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,030
yeah you don't need it because the

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,820
drafts are all on github but the actual

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,500
like approve document you have to buy I

00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,320
think it's not very expensive but it's

00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,390
still like the Pacific buying a book and

00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,960
that's the key revenue source for many

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,310
of the organizations anyway long story

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,900
short these were the strengths and

00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:26,910
weaknesses of the two NT to

00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:30,090
constituencies that we analyzed without

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,760
condensing it we're saying what actually

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,800
complements we complement each other and

00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,350
we're competing at the same time but for

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,330
different things we create complementary

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,200
products open-source implementations

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,970
versus approved status documents right

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,880
and if you need specifications and

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,170
implementations you need both it doesn't

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,850
matter if your community writes

00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,650
documentation understands development

00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,970
group in the end what you're doing is

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,880
you're creating specifications and

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,630
implementations I'm not fully

00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,670
complimentary

00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,610
like if it would be very happy if the

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:05,550
approved specification for our NT

00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,580
frameworks come out of sin why not we

00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,680
don't have to do it to pray

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:13,650
however process are we competing and

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,890
since every development effort has to

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,020
choose either an open

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,180
online process or working group based

00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,010
process you have to make a choice it

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,200
can't be in the process that a process

00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,740
perspective from the puzzle perspective

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,030
combined status of open top source you

00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,520
can combine you can create the

00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,740
specification in a standards development

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,720
process and the implementation in normal

00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:38,170
sauce process but for each you have to

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,090
make a choice right that's why offices

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,770
development doesn't successfully happen

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,930
at standards development organizations

00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:47,140
and usually we are not very good at

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:50,340
producing approved specifications so

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:53,350
yeah so we're comfortable complements or

00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:57,130
complementary and prisoners at the same

00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:59,500
time which makes the question how do we

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:03,370
decide which process to apply image to

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:06,280
focus on first this is how we started

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,050
like you said do these different models

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,340
of like implementing first specifying

00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:15,120
first what determines which way to go

00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,560
which path we choose through this model

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:22,960
the differentiator is called cost of

00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:26,560
change and after examples for this Wi-Fi

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,870
hardware and limits the kernel we have I

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,490
think eight point five changes per hour

00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:35,230
in Linux in average in 2017 integrated

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:37,870
changes per hour in average including

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,920
Christmas New Year's and Easter holidays

00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:44,490
so pretty good right and then you have

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,950
like the interface to your Wi-Fi holiday

00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:50,470
so constant change if you find a bucket

00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,330
dinners is super low right you could

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,650
submit a patch it gets integrated and

00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,940
then the machine starts warming and

00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,670
everybody in the world eventually will

00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,930
you used to put the fixed code if you

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,580
find that bark in the Wi-Fi

00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,890
implementation in your hardware that's

00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,050
difficult to replace and this is this

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,600
differential which spans a continuum and

00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,610
and somewhere in the middle indeed a

00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,960
magic middle is a point where you say

00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,760
console changes pretty much the same

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,680
part for an existing in that way and

00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,810
this is where you choose a parallel

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,120
implementation model if cost of changes

00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,800
very high you specify first because you

00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,520
spend a lot of time and specification to

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,830
make sure that you

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,880
to change it later and of course of

00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,650
change is very low

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,870
you just focus implementation because

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,430
you say if I find a bug I'll fix it and

00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,230
I'll need a specification for that they

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,450
can get to a point where you actually

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,780
don't specify any more like in the case

00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:40,270
of parents because you say how write our

00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,510
specifications will be updated 8.5 x

00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:48,880
power so let's not do it you can read

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:50,380
the code yeah and there's this aspect of

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,720
like piece of iteration which usually is

00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,800
inversely related cost of change if this

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,780
sounds interesting to you we're actually

00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,150
there's a German publication of this

00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,410
whole paper already and where it's

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,400
coming out hopefully you're not ripping

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,400
software I did it's yeah

00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,130
so I said earlier this is a SWOT

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,380
analysis so strengths weaknesses and

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,790
compared for two constituencies which

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,650
makes it super interesting to talk about

00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,260
what if you look at the weaknesses of

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,150
both sides because normally you would

00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,470
say what is to compare the weaknesses

00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,810
compared to the weaknesses of one

00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,120
against the strange of the other what

00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:25,840
your discus on which is a super person

00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:28,630
but what we try to offer to crystallize

00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,580
here's what are things that both of

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:36,670
these constituencies can't really do

00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:38,740
very well both of us for them in us have

00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,960
trouble we're dealing with early miss

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:43,330
been heavy research development so

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,890
processors will you take five six ten

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,980
years before you even can produce a

00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:50,350
prototype no bob source community works

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,260
on this none of us work on something

00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,760
that will you take four years if you

00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,690
take years until you even have a working

00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,970
model however that's also not something

00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,140
that has handled very well in in sense

00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,310
the government organizations which is

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,870
why do you have this whole debate of

00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,900
standard Sencha paths because the

00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:09,220
argument here is we need to give people

00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,590
standard central paths so they have the

00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,000
incentive to invest for ten years before

00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:18,430
you can submit a new technology we have

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,300
globalization in a sense that we

00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,120
globally collaborate however we have

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,800
some fertility

00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,330
a lot of influence for example at the

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,250
policy-making level so we may

00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,710
collaborate globally but we can affect

00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,450
economic policy

00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,520
sounds of optimizations can tune extent

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:36,620
but only nationally so this whole trend

00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,600
of like global collaboration that I laid

00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,160
out earlier none of us are serving it

00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,950
really well and the case in point if you

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,540
think what we are collaborating globally

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,550
we are but it's clustered in language

00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,350
groups there's very little collaboration

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,210
between the Chinese speaking your source

00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,070
community and the English speaking on

00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:56,510
social community there is very little

00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:58,100
collaboration between I think South

00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,170
American and the rest of the world

00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:06,080
because some of their song has written

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:09,050
in Brazilian foreign language so yeah so

00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,220
we still have a lot of work to do and we

00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,020
talked earlier about the the

00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,590
intellectual property rights policies

00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,060
that seven-second organizations have

00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,400
deployed some of them really

00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,720
old-fashioned and then ours from the

00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,190
oxwas perspective they're not fully

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,710
evolved yet that's what we have to

00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:30,530
struggle with supply chains license

00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:32,330
appliance etc which means none of us has

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,040
got a fresh global domination yet we're

00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,810
all freaking is's into space and as a

00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,150
result we for example have an endless

00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,620
debate about what is an open standard we

00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,900
just can't get to an agreement what it

00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,550
is have you seen that they're like 15

00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,280
definition of definition of what the

00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:48,260
open standard is and our improve our

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,110
definition is an open standard can't

00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,460
implement a free software but that's not

00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,950
the definition if anybody else is using

00:42:52,460 --> 00:43:01,520
alright just huge spectrum what is

00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:04,270
friend etc so and as I said there's a

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,140
there's a people on this that is

00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,460
published in German language and will

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,530
publish in English language later this

00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,840
year and it's open access of course we

00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,690
as it should be so if you need more

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,450
details and never feel free to be it and

00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:19,040
then there's this Estonia ongoing as I

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,020
said of the European Commission joint

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,880
research centre on the interaction

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,800
between also software and licensing so

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,119
very similar what this indicates is that

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,880
at the policy-making level there's a

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,980
this issue and there's awareness that to

00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,839
make good policy we should have a good

00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,190
empirical based on what which we make

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,109
the decisions and this is the intention

00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:38,849
of that so I really congratulate the

00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:41,279
joint research that are saying we'll

00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,579
just do this for two years first before

00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:46,410
we recommend anything to policymakers

00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:49,460
and here are some intermediate results

00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:52,980
first of all what we did is we looked at

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,900
existing interactions of standardization

00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,460
and implementation for example the

00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,130
atmospheric community one of the most

00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,249
successful examples of collaboration

00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:04,710
between stands to welcome the invitation

00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:06,599
the community diplomatic he is involved

00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,990
in standards development there is a lot

00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,859
of collaboration in the sense of

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,900
feedback from the developer community

00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:14,849
for new language features that make it a

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,529
new version of the language and thinking

00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,849
about six months were these cycles for

00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:23,400
language specifications excellent stuff

00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:26,220
similarly the C++ working group spin

00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,519
old-fashioned right it's like total of

00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,200
ISO but the working models are pretty

00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,089
much to say right they published a

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,470
documents on github you can comment on

00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:40,079
them it's a bit slower but yeah we see

00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:43,349
the same thing in Java it's a de Java

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,390
community process is like run the tech

00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:47,519
control by Oracle still but it's at

00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,170
least the collaboration between do so as

00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,119
implementers all the keel

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,210
implementations of Java these days are

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,799
the free software licenses um it's a

00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:00,059
charge under that many others and we see

00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:02,460
these three approaches right

00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:03,660
specification first languages you have

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,359
to specify first before you can

00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,239
implement them clearly obviously with

00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:13,640
implementation foundry OpenStack etc

00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:16,170
packages and then you have this parallel

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,869
approach and one thing that we found is

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,789
that the parallel approach sometimes

00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:23,009
that work developed later so he started

00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:24,239
with implementation and then over time

00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:27,089
they became more more collaborative

00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,739
these groups they they invited feedback

00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:30,540
from the community and then he had like

00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:32,850
rolling release cycle for across

00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,250
for example which is a shift in the way

00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:40,500
of standards developed it used to be top

00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:41,670
down and now it's worth rolling oh by

00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,250
the way interesting thing that we

00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,170
learned is what a software business

00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,510
governments because when generously put

00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,010
out the request for the study they asked

00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:52,950
what seemed to actually people to a

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,930
software and what disturbs the moment

00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,510
obvious agents do and you said you know

00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,740
that's not the right question to ask

00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,270
because it's not a question of how

00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,290
software licenses the question of how

00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,120
does the community develop the

00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:07,530
software's a question of governance and

00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,120
so we actually went and defined a lot of

00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,470
thing to provide the actual definitions

00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,030
for things like the wide open source

00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:14,100
community upstream downstream network

00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,560
the things I talked about today they're

00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,770
now written documented and will be

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,960
published as a reporter to see so that I

00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,730
think this provides a whole new level of

00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,700
understanding how do i dr. Spivak you

00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,830
arts because i think that mostly also

00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,150
software was seen as a legal thing in

00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:33,480
the sense of its software than open

00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,760
source license nobody really cared in a

00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,110
civil way of looking at it how it was

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,500
developed right and yes we pointed out a

00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,850
lot

00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,260
that this was a question of governance

00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,120
and then you may have heard of this is

00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,880
the debate on your compatibility between

00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:51,690
path licensing and free software

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:54,030
licenses we said yeah but that will not

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,740
fix the problem like you can't make you

00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:57,000
can't create legal compatibility and

00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,000
expect that now there will be

00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,680
collaboration because in the end this is

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,780
a precondition but people are

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,180
participating for Charlie and by

00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,620
participating voluntarily they make a

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,810
decision if they want to participate or

00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,240
not and that is based on the becoming

00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:15,600
level of welcoming yes level of your

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,540
community yeah so this is maybe not

00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,700
surprising to us what I believe it's

00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:24,090
it's good that this is documented at the

00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,220
policy maker level right maybe some

00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:30,450
interesting details prevent license

00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:33,930
choices there are is a kind of process

00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:36,780
of normalization of the licenses that we

00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:40,110
use these are all large-scale projects

00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,640
we basically have hpo families on MIT

00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,069
and

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,369
about you two and we know that there are

00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:48,109
over 100 proof open-source licenses the

00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:50,720
vast majority of them are mostly

00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:52,579
historical right these days all the new

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,170
projects if they're interesting they're

00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,000
hugely use apache2

00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,829
and that's not a bad thing because it

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,599
simplifies collaboration it makes it

00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:01,069
easier because you don't have to mean

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,579
all the lies it just has to understand

00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:05,869
the ones that are relevant yeah I spoke

00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:07,640
about the term governance before there

00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:11,119
is another interesting observation and

00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:13,880
that is now the term itself under is

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,250
understood in standards organizations as

00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,230
the legal framework Saudi governance is

00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,450
the legal framework and if you want to

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:22,220
work with them you read it and you say I

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:25,279
agree and I approve and I will / take

00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,740
part and that's already said for us it's

00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:29,390
different we develop governance as the

00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,279
mode of collaboration and then they

00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,710
taught me choose license and say because

00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:37,099
we collaborate this way this is released

00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:38,809
under the LGPL right so you can read the

00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:43,579
LGPL to understand how the community

00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:45,019
works basically but that's how standards

00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,579
development organizations would use the

00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:48,190
term governance which is interesting it

00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:50,269
just in the question of nomenclature

00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,650
understanding the other side and what

00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:53,930
words they use and what they mean by

00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,190
that and something as basic as

00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:59,059
governance has basically two different

00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:02,750
context there's another claim that is

00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:04,339
and that is that it's all nice and good

00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,079
of these like hackers in your source

00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:08,329
community collaborate maybe they can get

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,009
20 people together but for me a large

00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:12,829
collaboration you need a working group

00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:15,890
and standardization as the guidance or

00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:18,380
work and we try to really undermine as

00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:21,410
claimed by giving a couple of examples

00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:25,789
for example of cloud foundry with 4,000

00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:29,380
individual participants 70 companies and

00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:33,019
for the different software modules were

00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:36,019
OpenStack in this case with 6600 video

00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:37,160
participants over 3,000 commits and I

00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:38,000
was interesting because that was

00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,160
unexpected

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,259
people really assumed that those

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,200
communities like small decentralized

00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:46,810
groups status development is for a large

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,420
scale leverage

00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:53,460
we give these numbers to say no and

00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,460
that's another misconception and that is

00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,660
all source is basically volunteer-driven

00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,250
and these all hackers and students that

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,250
that is prevalent still in in many

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:05,080
circles so you believe we're all working

00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,470
at companies for decades right but the

00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,870
image is still they happen debasement

00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:14,040
tranqs also called an Amiga and so yeah

00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:16,540
we we condense this we said much most

00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,150
large scale committees today of Industry

00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,190
head they are their culture want a

00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:23,580
participation might invite businesses to

00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,630
participate volunteers as well

00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,960
damn I talked to see but they also

00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:31,120
membership these very similar to

00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,860
telephone organizations they have

00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,510
standardized governance worms if you

00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,950
look at the eighty charters of the

00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:39,040
different projects of the Linux

00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:40,540
Foundation they're almost identical and

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,210
they all use of magic to is important

00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,740
about license if you compare charters of

00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:49,360
project that eclipse attacks you also

00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:51,820
very similar so how the communities run

00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,830
their own operation has become more

00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,270
mobile device and that's on practice

00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,980
because that makes it easier for you to

00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,750
join a community contribute some work

00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,750
without having to like read the backlog

00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,160
for three years to see how they work oh

00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:05,550
yeah some explicit statutes they have

00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,590
IPR policies is also surprising to

00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,780
regulators because it's not about the

00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:15,160
fifth bunch of hippies

00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:19,090
yeah etc so I'm coming to a close here

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,970
we identified a ship in what a standard

00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:24,040
is so the old understanding of what the

00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,290
Senate is it enables competition between

00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,050
implementers maybe it enables

00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:31,870
interoperability but our communities

00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:34,180
sometimes say yes then it's mitigate

00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:36,820
cost of change that's still like a

00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,700
continuum of like more stent Pro

00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,680
standard arguments the joint

00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,570
implementation is the standard we see

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,250
this a lot in in our environment where

00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,750
every city is one product and one uses

00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,269
if in it's free software why would we

00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:51,029
create another compliment

00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:57,299
to a compatible product to it that just

00:51:51,029 --> 00:52:01,019
creates friction or the harsh can

00:51:57,299 --> 00:52:02,489
counter extreme is specification leads

00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:04,259
to fragmentation we don't create

00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:06,089
specifications because then people make

00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:07,229
competing implementations instead of

00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,809
collaborating with us

00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:15,679
this is supported from automotive grade

00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:18,419
limits my final perplexing argument is

00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,789
that free software is a state-of-the-art

00:52:18,419 --> 00:52:22,439
commodity do you know these terms state

00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:25,679
of the art and commodity is that

00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:27,059
understandable right normally you say I

00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,249
know something is state-of-the-art

00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:30,869
its innovative and cool or is it what it

00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:34,829
is or in your mass-produced

00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:36,719
however our business model is to

00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:38,669
collaborate two SEC research development

00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,429
cost distributed to many parties so what

00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:43,229
we do is investment Fe research

00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:45,149
development that's why we get together

00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:47,309
we don't want to do the investment

00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:49,229
ourselves so in state of the art

00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:50,729
everything we create is neat might have

00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:52,009
messed up engineers in the world why

00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:56,129
wouldn't it be

00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:59,249
its innovative and it's not the French

00:52:56,129 --> 00:53:00,809
ad hasn't really because it's not it not

00:52:59,249 --> 00:53:02,429
differentiating because everybody has

00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:04,259
access to it so it doesn't give you a

00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:06,659
competitive edge over here because you

00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:09,329
can use the same code and this is where

00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:11,309
policymakers they fall over you say well

00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:13,049
we I don't have differentiating in state

00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:16,019
of the art we have commodity it's not

00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:19,469
the same well it is so it's a commodity

00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:22,169
and the public good Wow and then we have

00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:29,099
a great quiet room of people with PhDs

00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:31,319
in economics and then here's the last P

00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:32,969
aspect of free software we have no

00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:34,859
negotiation I don't know if you ever

00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:36,889
thought about this much I didn't before

00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:38,929
I did this like very theoretical work

00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:41,939
but the key differentiator for us

00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:43,559
between us and say large industry

00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:45,629
collaborations based on standards is

00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,180
that nor the first negotiate over using

00:53:45,629 --> 00:53:49,920
other people

00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:52,140
we have any faculty with licensing

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,470
relationships and we don't care because

00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,780
it's all automatic this is not as a

00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,610
sitting on so stated argument this is an

00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,290
argument of the transaction cost

00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:03,540
participation if you look at it from an

00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:05,520
economic perspective and this is why

00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,170
does a certain limit and how many

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,330
parties can participate if you have

00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,190
negotiation and we don't have that limit

00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:15,720
and this is what we are collaborate the

00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:18,020
others all right so let me close give me

00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,020
two minutes

00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,100
how is this relevant I gave you like a

00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,780
huge run down over like rude economic

00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:30,390
discussions patterns yeah but this is

00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,360
actually being discussed in Brussels and

00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:36,240
in your in your countries and globally

00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:39,240
and at the United Nations at the moment

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:42,060
for example still today is innovation

00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,380
metric when people say they compare the

00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,590
innovativeness of country companies

00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,320
sorry countries by how many you patent

00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:51,330
applications are written in this country

00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,820
and we say well deal close community

00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,740
never writes any patents right so for

00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:58,740
example and Yolandi budget number of

00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:00,930
patents file etc those are still metrics

00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,370
and we're arguing against using this as

00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:06,180
metrics for innovation because it makes

00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:07,920
no sense whatsoever anymore there's a

00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,770
very interesting debate ongoing about

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,150
what's the definition of open source

00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:14,460
so here's a quote from our interview

00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,440
participants saying why do you only

00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,850
reference your source initiatives

00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,610
definition of open source at your

00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:23,760
interviews our and summers because that

00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:25,950
is the definition of open source but

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,140
people says no no no we disagree that's

00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:29,550
just one organization that we have our

00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,720
own definition of open source and it

00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:33,990
doesn't include patent rights that you

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,860
can't use the stuff commercially so this

00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:39,090
is still ongoing this is not done with

00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,520
there's a very polarized to be that the

00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,770
moment it tries to frame open sores in

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,720
the descriptive term descriptive term

00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,200
means it has no meaning except the two

00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,140
words

00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,640
Berlin source versus state affiliate

00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,980
term of the art term of art where you

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,020
say it has a concrete meaning which is

00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,390
the officers definition

00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,910
needless to say some industry players

00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,550
would prefer it to be not based on your

00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:06,210
source definition because they can like

00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:08,970
mangle the words and name things core

00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:10,530
things officers that aren't and that we

00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,450
also see very polarized that we did

00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:16,020
postulate or close the framework only

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:18,360
for copyright management as opposed to a

00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,880
mode of collaboration this is kind of

00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,740
going on behind the scenes because the

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,550
debate has been taken in two places

00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:29,720
where we usually do not participate

00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:32,970
regulation the Directorate General for

00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,340
growth in European Union the European

00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:40,170
Commission standards development

00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:41,880
organizations etc etc and these are my

00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,520
places where we as the water also

00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,500
sweetie you are usually present and this

00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:50,730
is basically my call to action here in

00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,930
this room is make sure that you know

00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:55,200
where did it do it the battles are

00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:59,280
happening and that we're at the table in

00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:04,250
Brussels in Stockholm and Berlin that's

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:08,820
what we need to do thank you

00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:08,820
[Applause]

00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,460
