Title: Open Source, Standards Development and Patents in Europe - Mirko Boehm
Publication date: 2019-04-17
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	The standards community develops specifications. The FOSS community implements standards. The FOSS community also develops industry standards. How does this the interaction function? And is it working well? How do policy makers interact with the FOSS community to set safety standards and other requirements? What is the relationship between standards-essential patents and FOSS? What comes first, specification or implementation? Where does innovation happen, and what is the platform to develop consensus on technical standards in a market segment? Based on research work at TU Berlin and for the Joint Research Center of the European Commission and the work of the Open Invention Network to protect key FOSS projects from patent litigation, the presentation will discuss the current state of the debate at the European and international level, and provide an outlook on how the roles and functions of standards-development organisations and the wider FOSS community are converging. No live demos, unfortunately.
