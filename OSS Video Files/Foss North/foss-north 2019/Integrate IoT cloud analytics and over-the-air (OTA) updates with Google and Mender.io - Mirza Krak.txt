Publication date: 2019-04-17
Playlist: foss-north 2019
Description: 
	We will demonstrate how to use and integrate analytics and OTA updates into an IoT product. We will cover the integration of software update management into a Cloud IoT solution that allows you to easily and securely connect, manage, and ingest data from millions of globally dispersed devices, providing a complete solution for collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing IoT data in real-time.
In this talk, we will specifically use the integration between Google’s Cloud IoT Core and the Mender open source project. We’ll walk the audience through the following:

   - Overview of device registration in Google IoT Core and Mender
   - IoT device level OTA update services and how it is orchestrated between IoT images (Google Cloud Storage), the Mender OS Build System (Google Compute Engine), and the Mender Management Server (Google Compute Engine)
   - Preauthorization of devices in the Mender Server using the same credentials as IoT Core, keeping the security model robust but simple
   - Central management of your entire IoT data network from a single pane of glass
   - Demo of IoT analytics application with OTA updates in Yocto Project
