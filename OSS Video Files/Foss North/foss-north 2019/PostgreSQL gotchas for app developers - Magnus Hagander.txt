Description: 
	Some things when it comes to working with databases are obvious to everybody. Other things are hidden from everybody. Yet some can be obvious to an experienced DBA, but come as a big surprise to application developers, and these can often be different between different databases.
In this talk I'll go through some of the common mistakes I've seen in applications built against PostgreSQL that made perfect sense, yet were suboptimal or failed.
Magnus Hagander is a member of the PostgreSQL Core Team and a developer and code committer in the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.

---

Magnus is one of the original developers of the Windows port of PostgreSQL. These days, he mostly works on other parts of the PostgreSQL backend, recently with a focus on security features, monitoring and backup/replication interfaces and tools.
He is also one of the core members of the postgresql.org infrastructure team, maintaining the servers that power the project, and one of the maintainers of the postgresql.org website. He also contributes to pgAdmin and other related projects.
He's been a PostgreSQL user since version 6 (with some non-serious use of Postgres 95 before that), and currently serves on the Core Team and as President of the Board for PostgreSQL Europe.
To pay the bills, he is a PostgreSQL and open source software consultant at Redpill Linpro in Stockholm, Sweden, where he works on consulting, support and training services, as well as custom development work.
