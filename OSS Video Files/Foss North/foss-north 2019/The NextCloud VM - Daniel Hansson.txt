Description: 
	The Nextcloud VM is a popular way to deploy your Nextcloud for the first time. The scripts make it easy for any sysadmin to deploy in almost any environment. It's made with simplicity in mind and is therefore also very popular amongst users that aren't familiar with Linux.
This talk will explain a little bit about the history behind the VM and how it's developed over time.
