Description: 
	Zipper is an Ethereum based mobile platform which brings blockchain based services to our smartphones in one seamless and user-controlled experience.

At first, Zipper provides everyday smartphone users an easy and safe way to manage their identity and private keys. This makes it possible for anyone to access blockchain based services out-of-the-box in an easy and intuitive way - just like Appleâ€™s services on iOS today - while being in full control of their identity, transactions and data. Zipper works in an isolated compartment in Android and Sailfish OS smartphones, making Zipper and its wallet secure while still easily accessible.

I think people are slowly start coming

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:25,790
in so let's get start so my name is

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,010
coastal monk and while my t-shirt have

00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,300
you saved differently from a company now

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,770
called CP not signal we can easily be

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,140
named away from this because of some

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,850
trademark trouble and it's not

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,340
experience I could recommend for maybe

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,379
for anybody especially after you know we

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,090
have already of the produced t-shirts of

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:50,270
us work so yeah so what I'm here to talk

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,760
to you today about today is CP which is

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,219
essentially an open source box

00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,230
experience for the blockchain and the

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:04,250
decentralized Internet so a little bit

00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:07,009
about myself and CP so previously I was

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,789
working in a company come Java which is

00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:11,840
making operating system code sailfish OS

00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:15,789
which you'll be hearing a bit about

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,100
later today I quit about 2016 hours

00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:20,840
CTO the company because I want to pursue

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,149
angle of how could you combine

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,119
blockchain and mobile

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,649
it's a hot car company but in practice

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,069
as more companies are paying it's

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:34,640
distributed we have people UK sylvatica

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:37,220
broadcast us some people sitting at the

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,410
Hong Kong offices basically all around

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:44,929
the world and become a base 12 let's say

00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,630
15 on US dollars you know to kind of

00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:49,640
pursue this angle and if you want to do

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,720
this on a website should use it sieve it

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,490
or not so one fixed camera true in every

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,750
name is exogenous first of we had found

00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,390
our main and back in the 90s that was

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,750
motor courtesy

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,030
these were just on like a new age kind

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,399
of hippie who embraced care to agree to

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,160
care stare trailing and play can revolve

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,890
on mrs. Reese such as New Age opinion is

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,920
imprinted rave culture smart wings free

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,230
software technology an ethically it

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,320
deployment is in an effort to bring

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,910
about a better world so wait a little

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,670
bit of questions that's pretty much what

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,510
we try to do in our company so before

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,430
get started

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,300
how many of you actually know about

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,489
launching is in this room just hands up

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:46,600
okay how many of you actually want that

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:48,310
how it works works you know but one of

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,900
the things that I would like to do is

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,760
instead of talking about the technology

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,620
I would like to talk about that same the

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,950
characteristics of the characteristics

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,630
of it so if your tread can't talk about

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,670
that you don't you first people don't

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,489
always get to money connected be useful

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,260
like for example let's say that somebody

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,060
start introducing the concept of a

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,650
bycicle

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,600
to do before I do see what you get to

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,269
use it for it would not be a very good

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,209
description about understanding when it

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,030
can actually do so let's start with what

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,060
blogging is not it's not a very

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,600
efficient database in fact it's pretty

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,980
much downright terrible for that purpose

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,510
I thought description would can't be

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,150
that it's kind of like a multiplayer

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,900
spreadsheet with access controls about

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,880
who and how what can create the context

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,500
of the certain fields along whether

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,390
let's say history about the contents

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,950
used to learn the positive what the

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,280
contents were the past and what

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,320
transaction debate the content exchange

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,410
in such a way you can compare this a

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,690
little bit to let's say in court so what

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,410
a court system essentially produces is

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,590
the consensus about

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,530
reality is in a particular the reality

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,750
of facts in a particular jurisdiction

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,250
you have kept court files end disputes

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,720
they get settled they're going to serve

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,670
laws contractors and so on and collect

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,770
elections to kind of change the

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,140
consensus my block sheet is quite much

00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,730
similar they can evaluate a corner

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,120
according to the terms deployed into the

00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,950
blockchain and allowed to that say

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,130
change the consensus according to these

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,630
rules but instead of let's say being in

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,990
court of humans they which is the way

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,800
that things are done today that

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,600
coherence that evaluates let's say

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,580
Swedish norms and language it's a

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,950
computational court that interprets code

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,740
and Confucians actions that in

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,840
tax-related and that come back let's say

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,290
a better procedures in a database is

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,700
called smart contracts which is a

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,350
terrible name as well because they're

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,210
not actually let's say legal contracts

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,800
in the traditional sense of the word and

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,590
does that often let's say treating them

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,970
like database when you're attacking on a

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,590
blockchain you should enter to read

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,140
there's a database usually treated back

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,520
court as in you don't really want to go

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,760
to court for every single thing that you

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,430
do you try to postpone it constructions

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,090
around as we actually only have to send

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,460
things to court

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,200
let's say because you need to establish

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,900
a change consensus for example now

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,520
somebody else a lot of my house or if

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,710
you get into dispute where it has to be

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,320
clarified what has actually factored

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:32,570
things so another characteristic of

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,850
auction is to subset unless you have

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,249
significant computing power as a bigger

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,659
that the contributor power figures

00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,549
percent of the country to power to the

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,609
blocking network it's really difficult

00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:47,419
to say fake Tampa with the consensus of

00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:49,219
the history of it and if they do you as

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,109
a glancing a client of a blockchain that

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,699
connected that we can also quite easily

00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:53,299
notice something's not getting exactly

00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:57,529
right

00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:58,879
and the last characteristic that all the

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,129
knows about launching a cent you will

00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,759
see on the same state and validate the

00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:06,049
transaction star the blockchain so when

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,929
they come affects that you end up with

00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:11,649
is that a blockchain can end up being

00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:14,599
that's a pretty difficult computational

00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:16,399
trusted for a party where even saying

00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,829
you don't need human third parties such

00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,169
as court or all the middlemen that

00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:23,539
exists today because basically a company

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,089
computers or are they otherwise proven

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,399
true to launching that the notice that

00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:30,049
there are forces in the transactions it

00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:36,979
can be a replacement was further for a

00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:38,659
human third party today okay so let's

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,269
just introduce a little bit about the

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:44,029
civil cryptocurrencies are so the

00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:46,099
imagine main segment world by which the

00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,729
way that you pay some money is go to

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,619
port

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,379
submit a court file in your moment have

00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:54,259
been a bit of fast for the court to

00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:56,389
actually process this that a particular

00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:59,059
part of the course that you own now

00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:01,610
belongs to some of a party and sign this

00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:03,259
particular court filing and eventually

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,079
the court comes along with a

00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:08,779
confirmation that now your father must

00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,159
be Mississippi to the registry and you

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,419
can then go ahead and let's see how's

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:15,680
the court harmony

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:17,470
going to aisle at the moment and in

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,550
addition to that you can also let's say

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,610
procreate together with the court in

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,880
order to lose a maintain the integrity

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,759
of their registry and by that let's say

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,490
more funds and that's essentially what

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,620
bitcoin is the traditional order of the

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,720
currency instead of having let's say a

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,060
handwritten signature name that you vote

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,250
on a court filing you will use stable to

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,440
signature I like what the key is

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,970
ignition of signing settlement and

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,949
instead of a paper form that you would

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,900
submit to a court you would generate a

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,419
data structure stadium basically that I

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,080
transfer excellent my gosh to the person

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:57,259
who can sign a transaction with the

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,919
public key that hashes to Y where Y is

00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:03,099
essentially was a Bitcoin address and

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,750
well X's on the heart bitcoins and

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:10,070
similarly in Bitcoin you will be able to

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,449
the say they want to contribute computer

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,419
power to the network knowledge maintain

00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,729
the integrity of the registry and that's

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,500
basically a very typical protocol and

00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:23,659
see where you are doing mining in order

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,159
to keep it but now imagine that you

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,320
could have multiple of these car than

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,800
just transaction happening you can't say

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,430
tomahto

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,169
and you couldn't apply for any kind of

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,450
coin or token model or whatever like

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,279
that the different properties and how

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,189
you

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,430
sound let's say that you put some a

00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:46,089
couple tokens for a technical conference

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:50,079
like this for example or continuity disk

00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:53,649
space to a network etc and essentially

00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:55,629
what you can make is make a program you

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,829
ever say your own kind of money of

00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,540
different values with different

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:06,069
properties this is basically what's

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:09,160
called tokens so if we have let's say

00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,819
these amazing decentralized technologies

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,660
today

00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:16,360
so like blockchain decent life storage

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,610
peer-to-peer networks wide everybody

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,620
using them yet but these are slicing

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,649
away from companies like Google are some

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,889
Facebook and Apple and it's actually

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,720
what simple why that is you some decent

00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:35,529
slice technology today is just way too

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:37,600
hard for people on mobile devices that

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,220
is actually even worse because when

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,920
people are the same developer blocking

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,480
software or decent fax technologies

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,540
they're using let's say the high powered

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,009
laptops or service etc instead of the

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,809
things that what most of us are running

00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,730
an app today doing or bombers

00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:55,540
communicating with others the things

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,459
that perhaps our mobile devices if you

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,269
can I want to compare with anything

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,889
you compare this means of any style

00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:06,970
using the software to the good old days

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:10,779
of selling jumpers computer carts

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:13,059
installing drivers writing con fixes and

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,069
basically sacrificing several furry

00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:18,579
animals in order to appease the software

00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:20,050
gods and the problem isn't just let's

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,240
say the humans have applications

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,920
themselves because even if you have this

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,319
any good user experience for a

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
decentralized technology it's gonna want

00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:31,059
on by the fact that you have to handle

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,939
your private keys and I cannot get my

00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:38,189
expectation by many people that you have

00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:38,189
to maintain it Swiss bank like security

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,990
basically and what we can't believe it

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:47,110
simply is that it should basically be as

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:50,319
easy to talk using this as having who

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:58,929
will count out pressing play on Netflix

00:10:50,319 --> 00:11:01,119
to play a movie so as I mentioned before

00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,309
you can't really understand what a

00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:06,670
bicycle is and these use cases pilots

00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:08,759
they see description of the components

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:12,009
that it's made from so I'll try to

00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,749
demonstrate a skin sample flow I wasn't

00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,309
going to make it they're more but the

00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:17,649
software cost well not very happy with

00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:19,569
the VA this morning so what I have not

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:24,309
working yesterday did not want to tell

00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:27,009
you that's just Alice so let's say that

00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,809
we have just met in a bar I would like

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:31,990
to share a little bit of token some

00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:34,119
other data or information about that who

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,730
I am so firstly you can interview to

00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,529
contact me I can show you a cure I can

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,329
show you a few look over to my phone and

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:44,029
you can scan it using

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:45,679
Karina and the other means even a bigger

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,019
picture well you don't need only you

00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:52,160
need to get a mobile application for

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:54,889
today and what is that essentially the

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,259
pops up is since your side uses sippy

00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,910
thing for the first time it's basically

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:03,319
let's say a Starbuck whistles for this

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:06,319
stuff and we asked you to confirm that

00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:09,350
you have better most of these terms and

00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:14,420
if you understand the terms here you are

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:16,939
blame or pivot and latter than I am and

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,829
we then proceeded to ask your email

00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:21,019
formulas or not so much for let's say

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,730
spamming I'm living like that or sending

00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,529
your newsletters but for basically

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,649
checking if your meter that's involved

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,999
with sipping identity for example it

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,660
might be that you have already started

00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:36,259
using the system box on your laptop or

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:39,949
tablet basically being able to means to

00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:41,089
connect these devices together so it

00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,639
feels a little bit like how enormous

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:45,769
another Google account even probably you

00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:50,660
guys have done it so long ago that you

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:52,549
forgot house that you like and that's

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,669
basically it for setting up your this

00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:58,129
your decentralized digital identity so

00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:59,959
it saying in the final version will turn

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:02,899
alpha version now it would be also

00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,089
suggested to for example that CP to your

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,040
home screen on your phone and let's say

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,499
name a push notification so you can get

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,239
information to later

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:15,639
identity and basically you're ready to

00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:17,349
roll at that point and start using any

00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:22,509
of the different decentralized

00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:23,859
applications so just to come iterate

00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,109
what has happened here that's a very

00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:28,029
short time you don't have to actually

00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:31,599
install any applications you know

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:33,279
through time use of these is - hold on

00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:35,889
your browser bit of a way it could set

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,079
up you have pretty much on thought with

00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,699
the decentralized it's not you can use

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,789
simply as you go to click a movie on

00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:44,919
Netflix and it begins playing you have

00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:48,099
taken to identity that you can kind of

00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:51,039
secure further as you gain more value

00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:54,549
let's say the stuff in your wallet or

00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:58,149
your data gives more value and what

00:13:54,549 --> 00:14:02,019
account do is trying to provide us a set

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,819
of services and api's that make these

00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:08,469
decent life certifications in some

00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:10,479
applications able to have basically

00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:12,399
services finding out for example how do

00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:14,289
you access access to different launching

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,439
networks how do you sign transactions

00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:20,979
where to access most law particular

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:23,229
content and so on so and while this

00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:24,970
might seem very simple just what kind of

00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:29,829
look at notice the state of the art at

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:32,829
the moment so my kind of favorite

00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:35,859
example is there was a very nice decent

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,869
life social network and the first thing

00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:39,819
it asked me to do was basically spent

00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:42,279
several our standard in a particular

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:45,639
block chain to my disk and I had a local

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:47,049
blocking node and if you want to hear

00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,399
anybody interested in decent wise

00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,470
technologies the last thing you should

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,270
do is ask them to wait

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,840
I was before they can actually do what

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:58,050
they want to do quite often it's such

00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,940
that many of these solutions asked me

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,970
okay so we should put printer paper

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,950
wallet which is basically a QR code

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,020
unencrypted form that you print out and

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,410
you store the part of the floorboards in

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,060
your grandma's house and several amounts

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,550
of people at this point I've already

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,670
lost interest and they don't understand

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,160
why they need to print a paper wallet us

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,150
write down 24 words which is basically

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,530
what can be generated into let's say

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:29,160
have the basic that they have a digital

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,990
activity addition to that most people

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,500
don't understand the jargon and that's a

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,390
new concepts that is useless things they

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,720
can't take you away from actually intend

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:42,240
that they have which is to actually use

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,880
a decentralized application it's quite

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,650
often that applications ask you to

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,020
download for example let's say material

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,530
produces a particle blockchain you have

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,730
to install other like if this software

00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,380
which is not you know I'll be talking

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,940
about a moment you have to tell them if

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:01,890
extension and it basically becomes quite

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,080
complicated compared to how you normally

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,690
expect it to work in the nice smooth way

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,370
on a mobile device and in there you can

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,990
get recommend okay so you need to get up

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:14,940
that's a hardware ball instead which is

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:17,610
officially an external security chip so

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,410
I just want to kind of show some basic

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,770
examples about how things in today so

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,119
this is very typical onboarding for that

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,609
user

00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:30,869
this implies that is you have to go to

00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:32,879
pro store and or many people don't don't

00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:35,519
know is that Charlie from stores locked

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:39,809
so no boxing for the people in China for

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,959
example you have to deal a lot of scary

00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:45,419
things like what the this extension can

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,739
do with your devices you know you don't

00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:50,389
really convinced that this is something

00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:52,379
that making to maintains your privacy

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,029
adding to the fact that they talk about

00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:57,059
better software than you get asked to

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:59,399
write down for words and copied

00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,529
somewhere safe that people are not

00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,809
really that good at that and then you

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:08,699
get very very confusing UX after the

00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:10,079
Atari actually fields and it's also

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,149
possible thing is you get these things

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,730
go well as which is things you sticking

00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:16,350
to use people and if you're usually go

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,689
about the licenses not feel an option

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,889
either

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,559
you won't have to print a wall that's

00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:25,049
like I was talking about which is

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,429
basically when you scan for the QR code

00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,129
reader you would not get anything

00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:31,080
particular useful this like you become

00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:33,629
expected you can expect these things

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,600
will be popping up beautiful UI that

00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:40,799
would be showing how to handle the fonts

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,110
particular in this paper wallet and the

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,750
middle one is a typical material

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,399
blocking note which it has found to be

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:53,159
of your expunge pretty clear that there

00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:56,309
was a junior who decide to your ex so

00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,049
you have just let's say it's seen the

00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,909
clips of what CP is like but I'll come

00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,620
back to North a little bit of bits and

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:08,700
why we're doing things the way they're

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:13,009
doing from not yet really so yeah so one

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,730
fact we believe is that everything in

00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:19,350
everything that comes down to how we

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,860
deal with SAT supplies applications

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,190
basically Sinatra to your

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,779
get yourself a secure digital identity

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,510
we also believe that it's basically

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,429
possible to do let's say progressive and

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,490
practical security that he meant I said

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,019
your grandfather can understand and then

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,570
it's possible that the same to use

00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:39,970
incentives such as children's you know

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:43,929
to visit our people towards better

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,909
security and as I got my chain before I

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:48,070
have previously revolver company that

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:52,539
thought mobile devices and operations

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,690
market so we very much know how hard it

00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,700
is to bring a bottle into the hands of

00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,429
consumers and this is really really

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,570
important thing if we wanted to say

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,799
decentralized away from existing

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,120
services like Google Facebook Apple etc

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,760
because you really don't have a lot of

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,350
time to convince people of the utility

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,240
or benefit of what you're doing with

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,000
your decentralized application if you

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,330
get into basically that they you know

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,240
the world but what they have to do and

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,529
we also believe that it's saying no

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,960
about let's say that acknowledge you

00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:28,240
some system blockchain instead about the

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,500
interactions and say removal or friction

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:41,080
between all of us that it actually

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:42,909
labels and secondly so you've probably

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,419
read in many newspapers there's a bit of

00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:48,750
a phrase about cryptocurrency and big

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,760
investment possibilities and so on and

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:55,120
it's actually not a lot of the money to

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,370
be honest if we are covered likes to say

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,590
that which the full potential of

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,330
launching the possibility that this

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,009
replaced several middlemen in our

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:10,190
societies ethnicity computational ones

00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:11,659
we can't really ask everybody to that

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,600
they both understand the technology

00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:17,059
depth and making with a vigilant Swiss

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,129
bank security like approach at all times

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,549
it really has to fit into the digital

00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:26,179
lives that people already lead if it's

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:28,419
basically all about degrees of security

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,299
that's imagine that say the value and

00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:34,340
data that you're trying to keep

00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,950
basically that five dollars requires

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,580
less security than let's say $5,000 to

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,470
go and you can also see this for example

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,950
not unless these accounts are today that

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,269
at least know that we're living that up

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,830
to a certain amount you don't have to

00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:50,960
use you think of examinee kind of

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:56,149
relying on that everything just go find

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:59,779
those of them out now let's give it to

00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:02,649
the technical part a little bit so CB

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:05,720
Cal has this key component called world

00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:07,190
if anybody of you worked in a better the

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,159
mobile devices you know that many

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,110
devices have basically security chips

00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:15,019
hardware security modules which has very

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,820
simple operations like generating a key

00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,399
a sonic when the key encrypted

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,450
decrypting something get the proper key

00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:25,129
of this of this particular key Wow let's

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,590
say the actual private key is stored

00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:29,899
inside the chip and you can't get at the

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,659
idea how hard even how hard you want and

00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:34,820
this is essentially what this wall

00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:38,629
component provides for they say they're

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,879
placed applications so what you are

00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:44,269
that's a CBT to identity is a basically

00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:46,789
say a master seat which is used to

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:50,869
generate separate but deterministically

00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:53,450
derived security context as in a known

00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:56,869
set of keys for every single

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,399
application website the uses it and but

00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,619
instead of let's say storing the master

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:05,359
seat and every device its constant

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:06,799
pieces and start separately so it's

00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,349
possible to let's say if you do should

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,729
normal phone then it's possible to cut

00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:15,859
it off like you would cut off a credit

00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:17,419
card in case that gets stolen and only

00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:20,929
when you actually need to do it as a

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:23,749
signing or operations life you need to

00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:25,969
declare something or you need to have a

00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:27,769
new security context for example case

00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:30,409
you need to start using your distributed

00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,909
application that the must see is

00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:35,479
definitely put together whatever stored

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:36,979
as such on the device and another

00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:40,039
feature of the small disk that

00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:42,589
essentially website can I get signed

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,329
statements from it saying that this

00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:47,029
other website you're talking to is

00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:49,219
actually the website that you need they

00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:52,489
say they are ha for example so you can I

00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:56,329
have done having in the communication in

00:22:52,489 --> 00:23:00,019
intercommunicating applications that can

00:22:56,329 --> 00:23:02,450
talk to each other essentially and all

00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:04,159
this code basically once in the users

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,259
browser it's a completely client-side we

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,089
don't meeting service related to this

00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,969
that you have to communicate to restore

00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:13,579
don't stole your keys and it's early on

00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:15,259
if it's basically the current ones from

00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:18,820
our web sites at this point or anything

00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:18,820
wanted locally if you really like to

00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:27,259
another that's a key technology used in

00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,389
cities some chemical ipfs it's not made

00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:32,599
by us but we're quite heavy users of it

00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:33,260
and what essentially it is is content

00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,250
address

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,780
so the traditional way of doing fixable

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,910
they're back to normal is that you asked

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,679
for particular file on a particular path

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:47,419
from a particular host and on some ipfs

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,020
what you do is instead you're asked from

00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:54,380
the hash of the data instead and it

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:58,610
fetches the state talk to you you know

00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,710
thing a big drug like mama and the

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,160
interesting about this is that it can

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,690
also run in completely inside depth also

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,400
do see technologies like for example a

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,809
about you see to connect to other nodes

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:14,000
of the PP other nodes on the network and

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:16,610
you can access and communicate to it to

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,679
maybe commit it that way and associates

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,480
really interesting use cases based this

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,429
just examples

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,410
collaborate didn't even but let's say

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:29,780
after that like Google Docs like which

00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,890
basically connects different people on

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,049
this peer-to-peer network together

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:38,059
basically anything without any middleman

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:40,370
in Italy in practice ipfs also has a

00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:43,070
couple other interesting functionalities

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:47,120
like something or by PMS it's their

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:48,620
built-in let's say to have that the

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,200
advantage for your particular public

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,380
keys and associated of you and if you

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,240
want to update the value this the party

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,840
you got want to dispel Tokyo that girl

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,580
had basically sign you know update to

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,160
this value or so and you end up with is

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,679
gonna almost edition twice key value

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,200
system where I'd say instead of updating

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,110
your website by upload new files

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,700
but they host instead you will basically

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,140
submit a site update

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,970
matching the new hash of your website to

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,000
this particular public EU I can then be

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,150
fetched out and as I got the last

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,370
functionality is this pop-up pops up

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,820
ability basically you can publish

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:34,530
messages across ipfs network towards a

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,440
particular topic and subscribe for these

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:40,220
topics so basically you can end up

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,160
having a little bit of a decentralized

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,180
exam chat or otherwise duplication

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,950
possibility and these are very useful if

00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:52,890
you want to let's say build to

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:54,120
distribute applications so then let's

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,960
say that you're writing an application

00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,230
so how do you make a CP app you

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,460
basically start off with typical PWA

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:07,200
which is progressive web applications

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,480
you make basically static files they

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,250
weren't entirely in the browser and then

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,150
you go on here to basically deploy this

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,610
to something like ipfs you know that go

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,850
ahead

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,650
with the CPI pis you can tell this this

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,380
user already since they signed up on out

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,520
at this point

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,710
you might want to show a button for

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,809
example or you just want to go ahead and

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,200
ask the user to sign up with how to use

00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:35,090
the application then it might be that

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,500
you can ask okay so we just need to know

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,670
what turnaround and most kind of

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,480
indicate that your actual application

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:43,100
that you are and then resolve this

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,900
basically that in order to start using

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,179
the applications a person just needs to

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,419
know the hash of your application which

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:53,809
is too cold and start using it

00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:55,690
immediately and it's it's pretty much

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,610
like Netflix like you know say you

00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,510
particular hash on a movie and you just

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,429
stop using it

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,700
that's it no need to download anything

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:06,710
and if you want you can basically ask

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,220
you to also add you to yours we kind of

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:14,840
bypass the traditional app store

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:16,490
limitations or all we are currently

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,049
doing this is the Pearl so we have some

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,230
ideas also how you could let's say

00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:27,380
integrate something like super over CP

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:30,200
that into a devices so for example you

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,580
could have the security features hosted

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,710
in to contain the running of off-site

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,490
Android because it's completely simpler

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,929
so even if Android is let's say attacked

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,299
you never go to a can access to the

00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:43,280
factory private keys for example it

00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,440
would be possible to let say enable

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,200
typed information into some like

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,630
application traits similar to how you

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,480
would let's say I have a Google account

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,340
or device you instead have a CP account

00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,049
which is a teacher

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,370
as a identity that doesn't let's take

00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,059
the vault or anybody here except for

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,900
yourself

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:03,490
and we would also be less able to do

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,440
myself that your display overlays

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,440
extinct in case you want to the same

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:13,860
talking buddy book and courts except

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:16,210
except on and also enable it's a the

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,950
deeper notification a graphical user

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:22,390
fingerprint readers are biometric

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:23,200
devices on that device and that's

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,590
basically it

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,080
so we will calculate working hard

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,640
towards opponent alpha which is should

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,880
be coming at the end of this month if

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,039
everything goes well and marketing

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,659
around that as well and we'll also be

00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,460
publishing this Oscar at this point

00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:42,190
which would be that's a traditional it's

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:45,039
not licensed and if you want to learn

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:49,899
more you can either ask questions just

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:53,640
right afterwards now exists a website to

00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:53,640
look at if you want

00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:59,930
[Applause]

00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,930
[Music]

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,380
alright excellent customer talk and fun

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:14,460
was really interesting so we have any

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:20,559
questions I see some what great sweets

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:23,950
so how is CP or isn't super or CP yes

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,860
okay how are you planning to make money

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:30,650
what is your business

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,260
that's couple different models yeah so

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,660
we believe that if you manage to get

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,190
let's say the decent life think about

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,020
that these different users are not

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,760
launching easy to approach it also other

00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,340
possibilities for a lot of different

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,650
businesses on top we have some things in

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,840
works which I have talked about at the

00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:51,200
moment which is one business case on top

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,290
of it but similar to something I can't

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,370
write that there will be business cases

00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,070
on top of it many different

00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,360
possibilities and probably it's not just

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,980
going to be us doing the pilot

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
difficulties there be a model so that's

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,900
the invest a little bit of money into

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,480
and basically only from there but

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,720
there's also an element of that there's

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,880
a so called CP token which we'll be

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,960
using to listen to my users and also

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,310
thought the ecosystem so this different

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,440
ways of the company to also make money

00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:24,190
for this but for now we are settled at

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,190
least for a while

00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:35,840
hello it's Cyprien or E or C 20 token

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,330
here C 20 token yes okay then I have

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,610
another birthday so Bitcoin has been

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,200
having a lot of problems with

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,960
scalability due to the blockchain

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,610
getting bigger to make on cash do you

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,920
think if theorem would have the same

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,170
problem because more more stuff for

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,320
being stored in the blockchain and it

00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,970
makes it order to host it yes the

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,980
problem at the moment a scalability

00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,760
function is the people to attract use it

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,040
as a database

00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,370
Wow yeah basically see it's not database

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,940
but are there a good database there are

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,190
many interesting

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,290
things to an offer at Sonic on plasma

00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:16,780
and ethnicity Rio where basically you

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,400
enable the ability to hold a let's say

00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,380
adventure and people that are

00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,970
participating in this system can then go

00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,130
out of dispute it's the side that

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:30,640
doesn't look correct so it's kind of

00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:32,320
like being able to notice that okay now

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,730
I'll just go across the mothers and

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,210
suddenly my heart belongs to somebody

00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,490
else

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,110
well I haven't signed up for this so I

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,370
want to go ahead and basically dispute

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:44,950
on the block you mr. Fox not know that

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,240
well this transaction can't be true for

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,550
example so there's many different

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,360
scaling possibilities possible at the

00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:54,580
moment but it might very well be the

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,140
real impact of some I suppose now that's

00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:11,920
the only currency but in how they use

00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:15,340
races instead so can you give me some

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,900
examples of applications that will be

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,030
developed I don't want to ruin your

00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,210
business model but link because I have

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:24,700
only heard about cryptocurrencies and I

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,060
don't know like it's a bit hard for me

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,460
to follow like you're ugly like no apps

00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,640
because I have a hard time imagining

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,820
what kind of applications can okay so

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,830
the question was

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,620
what complications you can build on

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:42,950
tonsillitis that's negative there's very

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:46,280
very simple example why do I have to

00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:50,600
today to share pictures of matching with

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:54,110
my family to go to Facebook if I let's

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,210
say near the public keys of the

00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,650
recipient empty of my family members all

00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,640
I would have to do with the patient we

00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:05,960
provide some file store and so far I got

00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,970
PFS perhaps an empty encryption

00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,490
decryption key we can do to actually

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,110
start to use it and basically would have

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,030
a shared space between me and my family

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,580
members we can access the files there

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:20,360
very basic piece of math technology you

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:23,030
don't need Facebook for that but it does

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,530
a blockchain I could just recommend this

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,900
several books that deal with these

00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:31,940
topics potential but while the

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,790
interesting is also that same supply

00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,410
chain tracing example but that's many

00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,420
many many different use cases at the

00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,700
bottom is that while there's thousands

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,530
of useless for this at the moment and

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,200
they always stop at the point that it's

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,840
super hard to click into this stuff so

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,880
it's also a fuss and we also are

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,560
commissioned to make it easy for people

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,240
to start doing this because then can see

00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,240
the real innovation happen on top of it

00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:03,350
yes I just want to ask about Walt you

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,420
said it was quite silent sounds great

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:10,040
I'm just wondering if I have multiple

00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,380
devices can I keep it in sync between so

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,470
the question is if you have multiple

00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,659
devices if you dig into an empty

00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:21,520
think yes that's generally clear because

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,700
essentially if you have a this master

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,780
seed now from that you can derive let's

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:32,440
say infinite layers of keys on the leaf

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:35,069
so if you go to this a young calm on one

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,780
of the devices if not using the same

00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:39,310
private and public keys on this device

00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,399
because they hear the same master seed

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:45,280
and that way they can get as he keeps

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,480
them synchronized quite easily now if

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,310
you have to look at something like a

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,520
file system again to kill concern you

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:56,319
more complicated but there's essential

00:34:51,520 --> 00:35:00,640
data structures called Capts which they

00:34:56,319 --> 00:35:02,650
were basically to synchronize different

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,880
objects together I would advise assume

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,960
that's a eventual consistency form so

00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,640
they used to have something that's

00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,099
synchronized okay across your devices

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,099
well I'd like to get to is that I can

00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:17,020
take an axe on stage and put it to my

00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,790
mobile phone and quite immediately

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,650
afterward standards in other ways with

00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,930
device what the same stuff without

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:27,339
having we have to upload my output the

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,200
data to Clark LaMarcus yeah was actually

00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:31,270
the kind of use case it was thinking

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,380
about the if I use my device on the bus

00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,460
or something like that

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,380
hmm yeah so that's basically the being

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:45,450
able also different recovery methods and

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:45,450
so on for some social economy thank you

00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:49,079
any more questions

00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:59,910
so you also mentioned it in an

00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:04,650
introductory letter one of the risks and

00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:06,209
is that there may be some some party who

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:11,059
has maybe a lot of money

00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:16,680
who buys many many nodes and like here

00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:20,819
basically with the system right after

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:24,209
any kind of workarounds or ways to

00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:25,769
prevent that because I like it's also

00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:28,499
problem that happens in the real world

00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:31,549
like when someone has a lot of money he

00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:34,890
can like buy people or people opinions

00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:38,130
but generally like people most people

00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,839
have a det so it's it can be hard to buy

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,119
them that like if is talking about

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,670
machines and computers the more money

00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,729
you have like that directly translates

00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:51,359
to a bigger number of nodes so is there

00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:57,869
any any ways or any ideas maybe the

00:36:51,359 --> 00:37:00,150
current state to prevent it so this way

00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:02,279
they can hit their economic problems so

00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,719
while many blockchains at the moment are

00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,939
using except little proof of work

00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,459
visually applied computer power there's

00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:16,319
also some fortunes which is not proof of

00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:19,349
stake as in when you think she'd do

00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:21,359
something let's say that that's bad for

00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:22,739
the integrity of the the blocks in fact

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,160
some companies that you do should

00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:27,589
deposit essentially come back if you

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,549
pentacon you returned to complete the

00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:33,019
rocket fall and that is also less a

00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,970
little more like illogical than

00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:36,410
something like before work where

00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,420
basically you're too busy computing

00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,930
power physically which usually usually

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:45,980
made by not support for the climate legs

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,869
either so it is an economic thing that

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:53,920
it all should be an equal economic

00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:53,920
incentive to not cheat these things

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:07,140
the second person for me excuse my

00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:08,819
ignorance if I'm saying something when

00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,700
it comes to watching stuff everybody's

00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:14,460
ignorant in some ways it's so you have

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,900
lost track of four topics thank you for

00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:20,819
being so kind so how does open source

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,789
female is why do you go but sources it

00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:26,960
so for other people to verify that your

00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:29,640
names are correct or public fitting yeah

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,549
maybe I could just talk about this from

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,859
uh that's a philosophical view nowadays

00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:37,980
not otherwise fall that is the purpose

00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:40,950
it's part of me it contains my memories

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,549
it contains my love they save the

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:46,260
personal abilities I have so they let's

00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:49,140
say that eventually we get to this point

00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:52,349
where we put computers into our brains

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,829
as implants why the hell would you want

00:38:52,349 --> 00:39:00,180
to fund something in your head that you

00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:01,279
can't read as you will not be upset open

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,880
source really matters a lot because

00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:04,890
especially when you're dealing with

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,599
let's say people's money they have to be

00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,339
able to verify that this erections don't

00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,170
think that it's not going to screw the

00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:14,130
moment that they send a few cents once

00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:16,049
in awhile to that in every other ways

00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:19,109
compromise you and give her as an

00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:22,470
additional requirement of security as

00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:25,920
well so open source is really important

00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,510
of people to understand that these smart

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,500
contracts law change they're not

00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:34,160
cheating you then I go to it's something

00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,160
you can actually trust

00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:45,640
okay so once again thanks

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:52,449
