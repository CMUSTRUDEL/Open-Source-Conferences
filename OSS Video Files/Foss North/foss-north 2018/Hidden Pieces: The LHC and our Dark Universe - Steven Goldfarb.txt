Title: Hidden Pieces: The LHC and our Dark Universe - Steven Goldfarb
Publication date: 2018-04-30
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	On 4 July 2017, one billion people – a large portion of our planet’s population – took time out of their day to watch a one-and-a-half-hour scientific seminar featuring plots, graphs, Greek letters, and comic sans. Why? A deep-rooted survival instinct told these people that the discovery by CERN scientists of a fundamental component of our universe was something worth paying attention to. Or they were just news junkies. But, they were right.

Today, at CERN, and other physics laboratories around the world, we are seeking answers to the most fundamental questions of humankind: What are we made of? Where did we come from? Where are we going? What are the rules behind all this? Although we might never find the answers, the pursuit of them provides us with the knowledge and skills our children need to survive. I discuss current puzzles in particle physics and cosmology, then challenge us to keep opening our research (data, source, results) to take advantage of our culturally rich, diverse population.

[Music]

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,229
[Applause]

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,470
so another receivable for a runoff from

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,250
a physicist I need a physicist in

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,550
particle physics

00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,470
I quite pointed with computing we do a

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,960
lot of coding I'm not going to talk to

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,890
you about coding here now you talk to

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,059
you very simply about our universe and

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,800
about what we're trying to do with the

00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,660
Large Hadron Collider at CERN what we've

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,410
been doing a fan of aiming for some

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,390
leaders I started when I first made this

00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,309
I call this missing pieces as if we were

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,710
looking for missing pieces of the of the

00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:56,410
universe but in fact I think the

00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,899
universe is there infinity some things

00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,090
in the universe that are hidden and we

00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:05,080
have to try to find them in fact it

00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,490
turns out it's most of the universe now

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,110
first of all I like to just make sure

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,940
this is clear because I come from a

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,330
third world country across the Atlantic

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,380
Ocean

00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,720
so this talk will actually have accident

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,670
if any of you want lies or just you know

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,090
just discussion you can have a cup of

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:27,580
coffee so I want to show you a seminar

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,459
out of the I was very unfortunate to

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,280
attempt this happened in 2012 on July

00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,920
4th and this was a scientific seminar we

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,810
do these periodically the experiments

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,310
there are four major appearance on the

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,800
Large Hadron Collider there's many

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,860
different experiments at CERN LHC is not

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,390
all there is it sir it's European that

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,160
record for particle physics there's a

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,849
lot of work on a variety of things the

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,229
antimatter

00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:54,729
Petrino's - to the LHC and we were just

00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,810
presenting each other our results that

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,080
you can see there was a lot of interest

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,060
in this one and it was a very technical

00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,810
talk I just want to show you give you an

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,240
idea I'm not going to give you any

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,549
what's in the facts but this is these

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,560
are the kind of slides of a being show I

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,740
think perhaps the most interesting

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,810
number that I see it on this is this one

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:20,030
up here this is this is slide number 106

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,890
out of 116 this is the slide that Joe

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,660
Incandela with a spokesperson for the

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:29,600
CMS experiment at CERN and these are the

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,360
beautiful beautiful slides see who could

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,690
come up with the colors to make them or

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,000
the choice of Comic Sans

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,290
this was why a spokesperson at the time

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the Atlas experiment

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,120
fabiolita Dumpty who is now the director

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,950
general of CERN and that's lovely and

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,440
here what you see is a conclusion which

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,980
got people in tears and jumping up and

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:56,209
down his 5.0 a time is the Greek letter

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,870
Sigma that got us very very excited in

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:02,410
fact the following days there were

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,430
articles written the following week

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:09,410
including I don't know if you can see

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,780
okay this is auto world we don't usually

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,459
have our results presented in the world

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,950
I don't know why you think they'd be

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:19,070
interested like everything and even the

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,560
cover of The Economist later on but

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,850
pretty much all newspapers are covering

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,680
international news have a picture of

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,030
detectors or or an event on the picture

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,040
at the top there I happened to be in

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,440
Melbourne Australia at the time for our

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,299
conference and you can see there that

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,670
the full front page of The Guardian

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,510
their head and event displayed on

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:45,410
something showing particles colliding

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,630
and during that week 1 billion people

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,049
that's a pretty big number of billion

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,940
people around the globe saw video from

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,030
those slides each other

00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:00,920
I already have seminar so billion people

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:04,220
got to see Comic Sans that so I need you

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,350
to wonder you know why why on earth were

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,380
people around the globe interested by

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,510
the US so to really understand other

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,890
people better a previous seminar that

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:19,700
had happened much earlier this is the

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,970
famous particle physicist on who's there

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,940
yeah and she's presenting the work of

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,100
her graduate students on the amazake

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,650
just started our field at the time it

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,840
was very exciting for us he was smashing

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,630
things together which is still new to

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,910
try to understand what's inside and at

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,270
the time he was finding out there rocks

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,800
are made up of smaller rocks now the

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:49,160
smaller rocks and that was very

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:51,560
important it was groundbreaking the

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,970
thing is human human beings we have the

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,830
questions that that we have big

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,980
questions now we have any questions

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,480
questions give me more detail if any but

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,380
they're equally as big as they've ever

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:07,400
worked where they come from

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:10,669
or we made of what's our destiny where

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,950
we happen to where the rules are are the

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,940
rules behind all of this that were seen

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,740
and is there anything else out there

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,590
that we don't receive they will help

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,240
give us a better service so we got a

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,560
variety of different tools over the

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,720
years that we've used to try to

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,110
investigate this the one that probably

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,590
got us the farthest and we still use

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:37,370
today as a very high level of precision

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,680
is this thing the human is an amazing

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:45,200
amazing device and this is where we did

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,590
many many of our observations the human

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,000
eye can resolve

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,980
human hair this is my friend Eva

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,550
we're coming evil action station moves

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,650
in communication in Syria and if you

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,400
take a look very closely you can get to

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,230
on tens of microns of precision with

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,150
your own eyes without any other device

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,500
on there if she'll let them get that

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,310
close you can make that measurement

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,950
alternatively it's left looking in

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,480
pretty close you can get a pretty good

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:18,620
pretty good precision if you look far

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,480
away we can see things which are two and

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,200
a half million love goes away with our

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,160
bare eyes

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,720
this is Andromeda out there which is

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,530
actually pointing towards us but I don't

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,480
want to worry you about some are happy

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,370
but they're but I mean you can do a huge

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,530
amount of physics you can do a huge

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,660
amount of science seeing that you can

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,420
learn a lot about the world with just a

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,930
human I know

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,690
human beings are never never die we want

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,060
to know more we want to answer the big

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,840
questions I said we're forever are

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,450
looking out to see what's out there now

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,030
I've done a lot of Education in outreach

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,600
on my experiment I guess I've probably

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,240
got too old to write good code and but

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,580
this is very enjoyable I get to meet

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,400
people from all around the globe we had

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,740
something over 135,000 people actually

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,110
come on-site to visit most of them of

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,930
students as my students in this case I

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,710
also set up a system on in our control

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,470
room where we can talk to students in

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,210
their classroom and in this case I was

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,470
like my friend Dave Barney he's actually

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,150
from the CMS experiment

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,050
good friends we were live across the

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,670
street from each other and we both hung

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,230
out together to celebrate that he

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,170
explodes out because the two experiments

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,880
that discovered that together we asked

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,560
them to come join me you can see our

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,990
control room in the background on the

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,350
other side we have some students in a

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,870
classroom from Alaska actually other

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,790
time and see it's just dark from the two

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,740
sides of this evening where we were but

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,160
it was morning I think it's always dark

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,410
in Alaska as far as anything and this

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,500
young boy they're wearing the Netflix

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:08,130
and chill t-shirt in the front he didn't

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,710
know what it meant but he he gets and

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,050
just asked me this simple question which

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,900
to this day I'm still thinking about how

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,330
can we measure what we can see now that

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,190
the time he might talk to you a little

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,710
bit you know how it is you never see the

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,480
right things but I tried I can answer

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,700
you I'm talking about dark matter if

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,650
it's like this then I realized deep

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,830
inside that that's probably the most

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,190
profound questions that we ask that sums

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,099
up science science is trying to measure

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,930
what we can't see we use a couple

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,940
different methods for this one of them

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,120
is we try to see more we try to explore

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,530
so we went beyond our eyes and built

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,860
devices that can help our eyes

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:52,140
telescopes or microscopes and we also

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,400
went places we voyaged all over the

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,339
place to try to to to learn more about

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,350
our world in our universe but in

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,690
addition we also thought about things

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,790
work from what we saw we tried to

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,950
extrapolate and say you know making fun

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,110
kind understanding that's bigger than

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:14,030
just the things that we see these are

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,770
basically experimentalists and theorists

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,630
like myself my pants are soaked because

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,070
I didn't predict as a theorist would it

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,020
was

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:25,670
that I measured it very well this

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:29,000
morning so it's interesting about this

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,680
to see the play back and forth there is

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,210
some I don't know if you look at social

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,780
media these days if you do this stuff

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,160
it's not worth it but um there's you

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,900
know people out there putting everything

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,850
out there so moving car flat earth

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,360
people I thought that was done with

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,730
ethical it's a several thousand years

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,410
ago a guy named Eratosthenes over there

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,900
he measured the circumference is it

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,120
around me knew that well before it that

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,060
we saw you turning books as we saw the

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,030
shadow of the earth we hid what was

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,540
around but this guy he he traveled he

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,440
was he was a Greek who was working in

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,440
Alexandria at the time when he used to

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,900
travel south along the river and he knew

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,550
a certain how far it was to go to this

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,110
one village and in that village they had

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,980
told him you know if he looked down as

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,080
well at noon you can see the Sun on this

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,700
particular day the soul sisters are all

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,580
okay that's interesting that means of

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,640
the the the Sun was directly overhead

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,560
and that means we could make a

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,060
measurement so he got us poking south

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,060
underneath all this kind of military

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,310
review said you know get a pull out and

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,890
measure the shadow of that pole I know

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,750
how far it is from here to there you can

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,670
triangulate and even calculate the

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,400
circumference of our planet and they did

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,590
when they got I was within a few percent

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,750
depending on the accuracy of astana

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,310
at the time it could be one percenter

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,500
curve you you know several percent but

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,410
anyway they got a circumference now if

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,180
this guy traveling on these ships who

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,420
when he set out to steal from Portugal

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,920
West had read those things which had

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,620
happened 2,000 years ahead

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,500
he would have packed more provisions to

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,329
try to make his way over to Asia and

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,550
India but he got lucky

00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:15,920
and ran into something on the way there

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,870
but it is always a play between the two

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,630
reading what's what's what's going on

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,820
and and then making making prediction

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,730
from what's been measured this is what

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,160
we do particle physics today we make

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,720
measurements and then we try to figure

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,470
out from that there was another great

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,410
philosopher who wrote about this George

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,209
Harrison basically said fool on the hill

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,589
sees the Sun going down on the eyes his

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,010
head sees the world spinning around

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:45,320
great words were great philosopher same

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,310
thing as Eratosthenes who's a few

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,240
thousand years after Eratosthenes

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:53,149
instruction so what we learned so far if

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,370
we're looking out into the distance over

00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,829
the past several centuries we've made

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,440
tremendous progress from the very first

00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,700
telescopes Galileo here who allowed us

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,640
to see that there were moons around

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,540
Jupiter doesn't just Jupiter write down

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,079
out there there was structure - even

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,760
better

00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,670
beautiful telescopes like the Hubble

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,620
which allows us to see all the billions

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,720
of galaxies that are out there in

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,160
addition to the one that we we have here

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,230
and we've been learn how to go beyond

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,970
looking at things we might not know

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,329
about this experiment there's any of you

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:33,820
heard of like oh we go okay you comfort

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,820
of others your nerdier than I thought

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,650
so I actually just had that blast

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,530
because I was lucky

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,090
early down to Pisa where there's another

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,490
component of this called veered off

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,650
Donner and it looks very similar to this

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,170
this is actually a device that listens

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,120
to the universe so along these these

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,820
arms there are ears

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,340
precision ears and they use the

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,560
interference of laser light which is

00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:03,420
shine down comes back to the central

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:10,020
point to see if the length of either of

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:11,150
those arms changes by a fraction of an

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,680
animal okay

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,460
carrying through angstroms their

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,220
measurement here

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,260
did it change by that much and the idea

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,730
of that was to try to test a theory that

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,300
was proposed two hundred years before I

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:27,780
have general relativity that I was

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,000
trying to see of space-time itself would

00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,340
would change if there was some big event

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,120
that involved gravity and indeed they

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,310
they measured this event here as their

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,660
their first major measurement was of two

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:44,970
black holes collided with each other few

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,320
million years beforehand and then since

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,330
then they've measured a lot of other

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,950
very interesting phenomena there later

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,850
so we've learned really how to look out

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,090
that distance and to learn about what's

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,890
out there in space looking in we've had

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,600
variety different devices we early

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,460
microscopes allowed us to see their

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,770
structure and try to assess if this is a

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:10,560
human here and learn how to use things

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:14,940
other than why we use electrons to get

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,190
more precise measurements and and now

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,440
the devices that we use the equivalents

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,660
of microscopes now are the things that

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,740
we work on at galaxies of colliding

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:29,550
uneasy protons getting to higher energy

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:32,310
higher energy it allows you to go to

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,370
smaller wavelengths and it allows you to

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,860
make

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,870
measurements and this is an image of a

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,580
collision in an experiment I work for

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,560
the Atlas experiment which is one of the

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,839
four experiments in the Large Hadron

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,640
Collider and I'll tell you a little bit

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,940
more about that later so we've got quite

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,560
a ways looking out in it looking in and

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,800
we've learned quite a bit you know

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,420
looking out basically learned in a world

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,180
with this one small deduct

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,100
out there you know beautiful system

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,279
around a star which is one of a hundred

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:07,180
billion stars in the galaxy which is one

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:11,200
of the billions galaxies out there in

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,300
the universe and we've also learned in

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,390
addition to learning the distances where

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:20,500
things are on how fast space how vast

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:23,200
the universe is we've also learned about

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,450
time how things have expanded since the

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,520
beginning of time the extrapolating from

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,430
the motions of galaxies clusters of

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,290
galaxies we can go back in time and

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,360
figured out that our age is something

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:39,660
like 13.8 billion years which you guys

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,080
come off from the song a Big Bang Theory

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:48,700
simply because we go back in time

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,440
also that the very early universe it was

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,029
a very rapid expansion which we don't

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,980
really understand it completely but it

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:58,420
gave us that microwave background

00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,970
radiation you've had at that time you

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,089
were seeing the electron starting to

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,240
form around nuclei but we have some idea

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,800
of this and the evolution that we're

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,600
going through surgery we're still trying

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,610
to answer that question where do we come

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,150
from and where are we going we also see

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,010
that our universe is expanding and not

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,750
just at a constant rate but it's

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,220
accelerating this expansion which is

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,220
something we don't yet know how to

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:30,370
explain so there are other bit about our

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:33,490
universe and and in looking in we've

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,160
learned of course about ourselves what

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,440
we're made out of basic components we

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,080
got the micro

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,570
to learning about cells tells molecules

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:48,930
molecules made out of atoms and maybe we

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:51,330
want inside of atoms and learn and learn

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,400
that in the very center there are the

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,460
protons and neutrons that make up the

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,040
nucleus they themselves have structure

00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,660
and these are quarks which are held

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,540
together by blue ones this is where

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,579
we're at right now and we actually have

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,319
this feeling that we've reached the

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,540
limit that these are fundamental

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,730
particles but I always hate to say that

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,770
without noting that many many times in

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,750
history human beings have said that so

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,939
we don't stop trying to measure that we

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,640
do look to see if corpse for example

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,350
have structure there's a lot of evidence

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,270
indicating that they don't that they are

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,709
fundamental when I say a fundamental

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,560
particle what I mean is something which

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:32,070
has no volume to it it has no structure

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,920
to it it's just a point and at that

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:38,520
point you have properties associated

00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,580
with it such as mass charge and they

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,200
seemed to be intrinsic properties what

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,740
we've done is mapped them all out when

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,960
we see that we have these nice much like

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,120
the periodic table of the elements you

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,490
see then we've figured out exactly

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,260
what's there what are the particles

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,480
which make up matter they're the ones on

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,700
the left hand side that's the quarks and

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,290
leptons and then there's these particles

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,180
that carry the forces over there on the

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,480
right of each other which are the bosons

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,480
but what's interesting about this we

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,150
ourselves are made up primarily usually

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,120
tired of this cork and the down cork on

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,160
the upper left and electrons we don't

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,020
need those other theories you don't know

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,930
why they're there we have to produce

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,000
them in the laboratory to see them or

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,520
mother nature does that for us with

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,620
cosmic rays which are no particles

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,930
coming from the Sun or other sources out

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,090
in space hit our upper atmosphere and

00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,110
make interactions produce some of those

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,700
particles we

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,380
we gonna measure this is where we first

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,020
learned about this Rudolf Hess did a lot

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,460
of this work in Innsbruck well so many

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,220
of those things over there we've had to

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,799
produce or have been produced but they

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,830
disappeared things which have highly

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,940
mass decayed to things which have lower

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,490
mass if so you can easily go from M C M

00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,210
c-squared to eat that happens all the

00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,830
time

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,290
they serve so things with having us

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,850
become things which other masks when you

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,740
get to the longest things they just sit

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,960
there you have to add energy to them to

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,960
produce something else so that's us for

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
this court down court in the electron so

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,290
there's these you know we characterize

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,760
these according to master these three

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:21,240
families electrons were flying we didn't

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,100
meet me once maybe or maybe not so some

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,669
ideas that maybe me wants to us to

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,900
evolve by messing with our our DNA but

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,520
these are just things which are out

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,910
there in space that we're seeing never

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,700
measuring but it doesn't make you wonder

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,010
why what's with this why are these

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,320
particles have different masses why is

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,350
it the exact same thing in different

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,110
families for the bigger masses so

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,910
basically this big question we had when

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,080
we had that going into the construction

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,360
of the other C was one of the things

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,130
driving us to build the Large Hadron

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,059
Collider what is this thing called yes

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,130
this gentleman here of Peter Higgs he

00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,580
and several others from small on Blair

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,280
Robert Ruth among them they looked into

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,520
this and tried to come up with an idea

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,280
of what would give things mass although

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,980
all the theories were great perfectly

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,110
symmetric if mass was zero if there was

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,299
no mass everything was it's just fine

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,520
about that but then we started by

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,990
another that existed and is there and

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,840
it's intrinsically start

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:28,470
the 4 string particles have masked

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,150
nothing could have covered that so these

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,309
brilliant minds came up with an idea

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,260
that in fact at the very beginning of

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,230
time there was some sort of symmetry

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,740
that was broken and a field appeared

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:43,170
everywhere on the steel this is a rough

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,850
you know illustration of it but

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,730
essentially there's a field everywhere

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,050
even under your chair on your fridge

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,140
there's appeal everywhere in the

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:54,090
universe its uniform and when a particle

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,170
and a fundamental particle interacts

00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:02,429
with it it gets mass this is how it gets

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:04,950
yes the more mass the particle has that

00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,809
means is more than it interacts with

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,150
that field that's what gives it that

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:11,670
mass and even the Higgs boson itself

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,420
gets its mass by interacting with its

00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:20,280
field so this is this is really purplish

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:24,750
this was let me see when this was 1964

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,120
that's when this was proposed and they

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,130
also by the way they told us you know

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,980
don't bother trying to figure this out

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,020
to find it because that field

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,520
corresponds to a particle you guys all

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,920
went to quantum field theory of course

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,750
we have we never field the other

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,940
particle we were partly in the field is

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,070
associated with it the duality that we

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,350
found in quantum mechanics so if they

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,630
say there's this field the uniform field

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,610
force field that means there's a new

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,550
color focus on proton just means the

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,800
kind of statistics that be hazed by

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:59,010
there's a particle the propagator of

00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:03,390
that field it's like an excitation of

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:05,340
the field and so you know they told us

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,320
don't bother looking for it we don't

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,670
have any idea what the mass of that

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,250
probability there's nothing that allows

00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:14,070
you to predict it and also it interacts

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,350
so weakly with matter that you have no

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,950
chance of doing it so we decided to set

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,950
out and try to find

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,300
totally normal human behavior right and

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,470
we built this device may be seen images

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,490
of it this is the Large Hadron Collider

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:34,170
it's it's roughly 100 litres underground

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:37,510
in the training world where it is

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:39,490
beautiful countryside here I'm very

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,670
fortunate to live over there this is

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,470
near Geneva that's the Geneva Airport

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:48,400
and the accelerators all underground

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,100
primarily because there's no way you

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,170
could afford the property but this is

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,510
very expensive here everything is

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,730
underground it's also stable down there

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,660
prevents a lot of cosmic rays meeting

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,670
inside the laboratory CERN is over close

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,710
to where the experiment I work on this

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,080
Atlas it's just a little triangle there

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,460
is the primary laboratory for certain

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,920
and can you come in to me but you should

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,929
come to visit and you can see the other

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,730
experiments those four places there are

00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:21,280
at least CMS LHC Gianaris those are

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,290
places were we collide protons you guys

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,830
the idea of the LHC is you take protons

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,950
and you zap them around One Direction

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,870
around the other direction as well use

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,030
superconducting magnets in order to get

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,210
a very high magnetic field without using

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:39,610
all the electricity that exists to do

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,270
that and and then you just simply pass

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,309
the names to each other you do cross the

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:50,200
beams that they tell you the maximum

00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:51,850
ghostbusters but we do and and and you

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,410
know the the probability of collision is

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,150
very very low but we have very very

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,850
intense because we do this

00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,010
something like roughly at the moment 40

00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,540
million

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,360
bunches of protons pass through each

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,290
other in each 714 layers in a bunch is a

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,850
hundred billion galaxies or the protons

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,500
that we squeeze together when we get

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,020
that a couple of these hundred billion

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,690
versus other billion we get roughly 25

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,390
30 40 collisions if we're lucky

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,610
yeah that's that's the game you have to

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,240
talk about we

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,770
that who we surround these points were

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,500
there are the collisions with these

00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:33,090
detectors the Atlas and CMS experiments

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,960
are very general purpose of the largest

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:40,110
we have each over 5000 people working on

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,910
our experiments 3,000 people sign our

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:45,809
papers every one of our papers since

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:48,450
because our names on the other

00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:49,770
experiments are more specific LHCb and

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,630
all these studies is trying to

00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,350
understand the early universe more

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,700
working at court love Sol OCD is trying

00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,260
to understand the imbalance of the

00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,820
universe without that there's matter in

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,340
int there they're focused on these

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,929
problems but work that wasn't CMS with

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,520
two general ones and we're the ones that

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:09,809
present it to each other that big

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,610
explosive this is what we saw we came on

00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:14,340
after after probably originally gathered

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,320
lots of images like this we don't look

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,450
image by image when you have 40 million

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,799
per second it's kind of a big job to do

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,410
that's why we do we use this thing

00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,559
called computing we devise something

00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,270
called me the LHC computing grid project

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,250
which allows us us to distribute the

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,919
computing worldwide was really the first

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,870
time Stern said there is no way that we

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,809
can do this centrally it has to be

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:38,490
distributed and so we have a sort of a

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:42,380
tier based system that does the

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,429
computing and the process collisions and

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,530
look at the properties of those

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:47,910
collisions you make selections I want to

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,799
look at certain types of collisions to

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,380
be right in Python

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,490
physicists are writing Python asking you

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,160
know are the vector look at all the

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,570
collisions they have two electrons and

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,570
submissive energies in the other this

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,360
and then we send that to our tiered

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:08,340
centers around the goal to get process

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,990
with send us back the results in the

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,030
output actually going to detail over a

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,580
coffee if you want to talk about that I

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,260
want to the physics here this is what we

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,150
saw when we put together our histograms

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,809
Mikado's very excited this is where

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:24,450
Fabiola and Joe were presenting during a

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,490
conference we saw these bumps so it's

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,550
actually what we do is we we model

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:32,130
we simulate we look at what we know what

00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,230
is well what would the world give us

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:37,410
without the Higgs boson this what the

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,660
background is and at that time this is

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:43,350
just a very early plots now we have

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:46,680
really big beautiful bumps that go

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,980
outside of what would expect to see

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,550
without the Higgs boson and and you can

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,350
see so essentially at 125 GeV we saw

00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,690
these deviations that told us that we

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,360
have brought the explosive now we have

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,520
many many Sigma well beyond 5 Sigma and

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,740
were on the process of doing precise

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,070
measurements but this at that moment

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,740
allowed us to pop that little heaps up

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,540
there it's a special boson it doesn't

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,890
have a direction it's a scalar bonus arm

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,370
which is a very interesting thing for us

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,140
means it's spin in a zero so it's

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,240
everywhere if it doesn't you know unlike

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,880
gravity which has a direction to it or

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,890
charge which has a direction things are

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,370
attracted to each other the Higgs field

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,260
is scalar it's everywhere and we put it

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:34,380
on our coffee cups and our t-shirts and

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,060
our ties the truth is we have it on

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,160
there before so I'm not going to say oh

00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,590
now we found it that's popping up in our

00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,660
theory because nothing made sense unless

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,300
we take an officer off from the 60s

00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,660
onward we had t-shirts and coffee cups

00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,800
with Madonna we just haven't seen it yet

00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,110
it was only a descendant we could

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,200
proudly drink coffee out of these coffee

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:59,880
causes that we were right but there's

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,840
still some things we don't know it's

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,840
such a how am i doing for time

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:19,200
favorite jokes what we still don't know

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:22,050
so we're about the major questions this

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,650
major question here where'd it come from

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:28,200
where are we going we don't understand

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,020
this expansion the acceleration of our

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,640
expansion imagine we're getting we're

00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,200
getting larger and larger the universe

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,810
is the universe itself gets expanded and

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,390
for that to happen it means there has to

00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:45,630
be some sort of energy in the universe

00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,220
is pulling it apart we just don't have a

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,710
clue there's a lot of theorists making

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,090
papers we try to explain dark energy

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,090
this is possible

00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:02,040
when they exist so 13.8 billion years

00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:03,990
ago we had this Big Bang everything that

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,670
we see in the laboratory tells us that

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,740
you get equal amounts of matter and

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,390
antimatter out when that happens

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,130
antimatter is essentially exactly the

00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,710
same as matter because an opposite

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,330
charge to it and that's what we see when

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,740
we produce certain neutral particles

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,690
when they decay you get there and you

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,540
can Antony about trying to positron you

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,580
learn Antonia

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:25,200
this is why I'm it's a big thing and all

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,990
these particles they came out and they

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,090
ran into each other and they annihilated

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,770
and you when you bring the particle and

00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,090
it's antiparticle together they

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,700
annihilate and give you a large amount

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,220
of energy and that happened and pretty

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,790
much everything disappeared but a little

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,590
bit of dust remained and that's else and

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,080
we don't know why why are we here we're

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,389
matter we do not see anti galaxies out

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,279
there there's no sources

00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,629
you can look for that but you know that

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,419
there would have to be a place within

00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:55,879
that you know antimatter was bordering

00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:58,459
of matter you see very high-energy gamma

00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:00,259
rays coming from that and we don't see

00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:03,559
that when we were standing everywhere we

00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:05,059
do not see that this antimatter exists

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,209
anymore you don't understand the

00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:10,099
imbalance we know that for certain

00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,659
particles it is possible for them to

00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,009
decaying give us a little bit more

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:15,289
matter than antimatter

00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:18,919
it's the be quark that's good LHC P is

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:21,769
word yeah but not at this level so we

00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,089
don't know why we exist where we made up

00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:25,309
are still looking into this

00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:29,629
or is it rushing balance you know all

00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:32,690
the way through or not and as I said

00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:34,729
before we were pretty convinced that the

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,309
quark the electron these these this

00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:39,289
table I put up there is it but we still

00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:40,759
go for it we have to you have to exploit

00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:42,409
that you can't just trust it we have to

00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,629
look into it and the very fact that

00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:46,129
there's three those makes me wonder that

00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:47,869
must be some structure in there

00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:53,269
somewhere sorry it's my own personal

00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:56,059
bias but they don't know another big

00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,320
question is why is gravity so now this

00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:00,889
morning when you got out of bed that

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,589
Delta was pretty strong probably but

00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:05,690
gravity's extraordinary weak compared to

00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:07,369
the other forces I sort of put orders of

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,440
magnitude of the forces up there it

00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:10,759
depends on their scale how close things

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,529
aren't to each other but if you go down

00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:17,029
to sort of the scale of the ports and he

00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:19,999
wants if if we set electromagnetism to

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,379
be one so magnets the strong nuclear

00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:25,179
force the thing that holds together

00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:27,499
protons is much stronger but with Russia

00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:29,329
sixty-four physicists that's not and

00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:31,909
hopefully this chopper couple were order

00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:34,009
metric buckler's magnitude the weak

00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:36,369
nuclear force that the heat we get from

00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:39,799
the Sun nuclear fission

00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:43,279
that's a bit linear terms of - force one

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,019
10,000 okay we we understand that but we

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,259
can actually make a theory that includes

00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:50,450
it that as you get to as you go back in

00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:53,059
time and go to higher energy you'll see

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,769
the strength of his forces converged on

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:56,659
each other and so we've actually the

00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:59,089
fear of leak out now includes those

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:01,249
three forces it includes them all

00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:04,069
together we were able to reconcile them

00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:08,749
and see that in fact that luxury you

00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:09,469
have an electric theory gravity we have

00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:12,409
no clue

00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:13,940
10 to the minus 41 it's a huge huge

00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:18,349
difference that maybe take two electrons

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,599
and trying to bring them together you

00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:22,009
know there they have had in a church

00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,879
that's you guys know they're gonna push

00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:25,219
against each other from the

00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:26,899
electromagnetism yeah they also have

00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:29,119
mass so they should pull together and

00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:31,339
the difference you know in strength

00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:35,149
these forces was a million million

00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:38,379
million million million million times

00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:40,849
and so we have not not with any theory

00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:42,289
yet that fits that into it there are

00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:44,419
some different ideas out there that

00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:46,099
mathematically look nice but we have no

00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,440
data to indicate how to solve that

00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:52,249
problem one of the ideas that came out

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,499
before the LHC Kemah is an idea that in

00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:56,599
fact we are simple electromagnetic

00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:59,359
beings we're living on this three

00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,399
dimensional manifold in a four

00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,619
dimensional space there's much more

00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:05,419
space up there is other dimensions at

00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:07,639
least one of the dimension and the grab

00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,469
knows about that so we're only seeing a

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,529
residual part of go you've only seen a

00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:15,079
small part of gravity just because we're

00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:17,479
simple electromagnetic things it's a

00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:20,089
very interesting idea and they propose

00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:21,829
we you know anybody have ideas but we

00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:23,599
pay attention to it when they tell us

00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:26,089
what to look for and so the theorists

00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,339
say you know you need to look for

00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,859
specifically for events they have traps

00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:33,200
coming out much like a black hole so

00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:34,909
they called it a micro black hole and

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,950
that was great thing for the LHC because

00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:38,080
suddenly we were going to produce black

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,990
holes and that

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,590
to the media everybody tend to pay

00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:47,080
attention when we turn down it's great

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,480
the energy of the LHC just to give you

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,720
that yet is this when two protons

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,940
collide that's the end it's really not

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,799
enough to make an earthquake in Nepal

00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,960
it's not enough to bring down an

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,779
airplane it's a very very small amount

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,029
of energy and it's not going to make a

00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:05,919
black hole that swallows the earth they

00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:08,980
can't they can make an instantaneous

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,899
that will exist for a second it shoots

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,109
out a bunch of traps symmetrically it

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:20,349
disappears that's their idea what would

00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:22,780
happen we also know from measurements of

00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:25,000
these cosmic rays you can measure how

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,240
much we get bombarded in our upper

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,770
atmosphere about charged particles this

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,740
happens at very high energy higher

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,480
energies that we can produce the LHC

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,460
that we're doing underground and

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,349
controlled environment worry or make the

00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,389
collision so we can measure them has

00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:43,359
been done by mother nature roughly ten

00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:45,460
thousand times already thoroughly

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,649
honored we just weren't around but we do

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,599
think our detectors in measuring these

00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:51,520
these cosmic rays so we're pretty sure

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,440
that those you know whatever we produce

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,940
we're going to be able to measure and

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,710
it's not going to have a higher energy

00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:00,910
than this would never learn how to

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:03,280
produce more than we put in by the way

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,830
people say they're so this is is you're

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,119
reproducing the Big Bang that doesn't

00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,430
that's not really our big thing with the

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,750
levitation

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,310
what would the media forget to write in

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,890
their carefully who said we're producing

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,290
the conditions and so what we're doing

00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:20,020
is is by squeezing the beams are being

00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,850
together or creating on the energy

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:26,880
density that you had just after the big

00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,290
there's a big different from energy it'd

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,410
be really hard for us to go get all the

00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,600
Starscream together again

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,030
the first we think about it is proposals

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,370
but but you know we can make the energy

00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,860
density so it says to think about that

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,410
you know instead of just doing that take

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,000
up take a thumbtack and put it here and

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,200
another thumbtack really here and then

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,370
do that you'll feel the difference

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,960
between energy and the energy density I

00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:54,110
don't actually don't do that at home I

00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,070
don't want any blame for the information

00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,250
and then finally one of the last

00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,410
questions that came up here is is this

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:03,660
galaxies that great there's a very

00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:08,010
bright astronomer here she is returning

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:11,400
spirit even she left us two years ago

00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:14,400
our she was a brilliant astronomer who

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,230
decided she would follow up on the work

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,110
of a guy named is Leakey who was looking

00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,630
at the motion of clusters of galaxies

00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,100
and he thought there's something strange

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,590
here there's something that's not been

00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,910
accounted for in that motion so she said

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,670
okay I got an idea

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,430
the what's holding galaxies together

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,340
simply gravity as the same thing as a

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:37,860
solar system you know from school people

00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,720
get a solar system how the motion of the

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,230
planets are the planets that are closer

00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,610
to the Sun more quickly ones on the

00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,950
outside more slowly

00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,750
anything populated ever since do you

00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,900
could calculate when you expect the

00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:56,460
orbits to be pretty precisely until you

00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:59,370
get to you know there's gravity and

00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,860
relativity which is a very first tiny

00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,480
effect essentially it's right there you

00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,740
can measure that you can predict it so

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,450
you can do the same thing for peacock

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,820
see it's got a center of mass and things

00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,150
are

00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:12,730
that Senator mess and you can predict

00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,440
what their motion should be and so she

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,150
even got up although that's nuts a new

00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,890
telescope you can see here and she's

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,480
healthy now and get that measurement and

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,970
we're gonna show that I'll have a nice

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,300
ski system right out there so she did it

00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:27,160
and of course we happen to scoot along

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,050
the stars on the outside of galaxies are

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,110
moving nearly as fast as the ones on the

00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,970
inside very very fast and then she took

00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,320
a step forward just said well you know

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,850
the only thing that I can think of that

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,100
would explain that is if there's stuff

00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,630
in these galaxies that we don't see much

00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,460
like this guy's Leakey has said that

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,500
many years earlier there's stuff in

00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,890
there and we don't know what it is and

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,270
so we've got called Dark Matter better

00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:53,050
or would have been call it invisible

00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:55,600
matter but it's basically just out there

00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:58,090
that we don't know what it is and it's

00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,830
now a small or not it's something like

00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:05,380
85% of something of that galaxy is made

00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,780
up of dark matter and we're clueless

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,640
we really don't know what dark matter

00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,890
this that can be try to look at it

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,350
online and understand from this and from

00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,180
dark energy what our universe is you

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:21,520
come up with exactly what you thought

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:24,730
it's beautiful there there's our

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,380
universe the vast majority of our

00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:31,480
universe there is stuff that we don't

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:32,920
understand some 95% most of it is our

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,960
energy the energy

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,550
furgus energy and that's the same thing

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,780
you can just convert people don't you

00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,340
spirit allows you to convert between

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:45,940
this yield 27% or so this is dark matter

00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:49,390
and then even of that foam that that the

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:52,060
top most of it is interstellar deaths we

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,370
account for you know less than a percent

00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,470
or even like half of a percent or so

00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,030
these are rough numbers these numbers

00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,100
change occasionally from time to time

00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:04,120
but roughly speaking or less than a

00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:09,250
percent of our universe which is kind of

00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:10,660
nice or not disturbing to some so just

00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,640
briefly touch on some things you know

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,320
how we answer these questions you know

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,050
what are ways that we can go about this

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,490
and it's are there

00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:21,210
and our experiment there are several

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:23,790
ways we think about this we have dealt

00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,830
an indirect economy different ways to

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,820
open paths when it's an open window this

00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,220
guy down here

00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,110
he's already exposed now what you know

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,730
about the Higgs bosons did they expose

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:36,810
our interacts with anything that has

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,520
mass several one of the arrows on we've

00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,560
measured these other arrows were

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,050
measuring the process of measuring how

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,700
much does the Higgs boson interact with

00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,740
these other particles well essentially

00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,810
it decays it transforms to these other

00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,200
particles of a measure the standard

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:54,060
model that we have that explains the the

00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,000
interactions between the particles tells

00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,670
us it should be she transform sometimes

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,150
to two leptons or two to two to corpse

00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:04,920
be corpse as you both understand your

00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,690
exist starting to get some precision on

00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,760
its measurements this year we're going

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,770
to go to many many more collisions we're

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,590
going to shut down and change our

00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:16,320
accelerator to get maybe a vector 10 or

00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,910
to 100 more collisions or something and

00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,130
that will allow us to measure these

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:23,130
numbers more precisely one of the things

00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,620
that you know if dark matter is indeed a

00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:28,440
fundamental particle that we haven't

00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,020
seen it's got to have mass that's why it

00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,000
was abduction of galaxies so so it's

00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,920
possible it's quite possible that we'll

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,990
be able to start measuring and producing

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,940
and measuring about dark matter it's

00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,950
possible we don't know it hasn't gone to

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,050
the right mass range so we have these

00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,460
sort of it's a new open window the Higgs

00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,740
boson was really the beginning of the

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,270
first thing that we found but it's

00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,340
really finding it didn't complete

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:54,180
anything it just it gave us some new

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:56,910
tool that we can use to measure and

00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,030
understand things and we have other open

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:02,790
things we have an open data there's an

00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,680
open data portal at CERN CERN is

00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:07,320
publicly funded and from the very very

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,050
beginning 1954 when CERN was put

00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,530
together it was decided that all of our

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:16,100
results need to be public and they are

00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,609
we publish absolutely everything

00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,039
recently I'm sorry

00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:22,079
more things public so our David you know

00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,029
I suppose we put the data in a form

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,440
that's understandable we put it out

00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:27,210
there and you can get at you can get a

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,650
different data sources these show you

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,470
there's different data sets your

00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:34,259
software to do things with it and they

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:36,299
come from the different experiments so

00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:38,279
there's there's more than a petabyte of

00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:39,900
data that's out there which is actually

00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:43,589
still a small fraction of what we've got

00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,690
what we put out as much as we can this

00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:48,630
was smut was started by CMS and my

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,660
colleagues a lot of credit for this they

00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,220
put out some large logging assess

00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,289
analysis we decided to focus on

00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:59,249
education about some specific data set

00:41:55,289 --> 00:42:02,930
of tools that allow you to to actually

00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:05,549
do things with classrooms mainly in the

00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:07,019
undergraduate students and you can

00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:09,989
actually have when you actually have a

00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:12,390
talk on this but if we can put ours on a

00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:14,009
key and that's very useful is if we're

00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,259
doing education to go to many places

00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:17,999
where network can be challenged

00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:19,950
computers challenged everything can be

00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:24,809
challenged to go into a classroom give

00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:27,749
them our data our team so these are this

00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:29,309
is for example I focused on Atlas

00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:31,259
because it's going to know about here

00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:33,420
several of the different data sets that

00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:37,079
we put out there one of the challenges

00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,519
we did coming on camera or sponsors

00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,900
these things we don't machine learning

00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,359
the challenge and this is really nice to

00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,999
see because my colleagues were sure that

00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:46,950
we did were doing everything the best

00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:50,460
for physicists we were like they're an

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:52,019
anomaly and so we are using machine

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,989
learning where you breathe in different

00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:57,359
methods but you know somebody I think it

00:42:54,989 --> 00:43:00,269
was in or City University looked at this

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,460
evidence laboratory there and they were

00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:03,989
from of the world of computing with you

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,579
guys and he'll look into this if you

00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:08,999
guys are like you know two decades

00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,599
behind we can do better and so we put up

00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,849
a challenge

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,840
and and of course they can do to people

00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:17,390
to better the challenge was to find

00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,150
he came to town that times because it's

00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,710
very it's a very complex environment

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,690
that you'd have to look at to pick out

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:26,330
the signal from the background very very

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,890
complex so that's it was quite

00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:31,460
interesting for us and helped us quite a

00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:34,370
bit so it's not just you know for fun

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,900
and education it also allowed us to do

00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,710
our little community service we have

00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,180
data sets out there just gives you kind

00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,160
of off suddenly

00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,990
low resolution conversion in a better

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,660
image but this shows you basically the

00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:50,030
tools that we give you you can actually

00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,860
try making selection criteria this is

00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,660
what we do you might say I want the

00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,760
photons would be a little bit more

00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,520
isolated or they have higher energy you

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,110
can slide and make cuts on this to see

00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,520
how that affects your mr. galliston see

00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,430
how it affects your signal to background

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:09,260
ratio so you just play with this stuff

00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:10,970
which is a lot of fun we also have touch

00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,090
open source ever if you guys know

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:16,700
anything about this but we do touch a

00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:19,190
bit out about this I'm not the expert

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,090
book journey has an effort that's out

00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,010
there and I think the one thing that

00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,550
they have that's that's maybe slightly

00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:28,790
different than a lot of the efforts is

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:30,920
is this open hardware repository

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,830
so they put the source out for building

00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:37,010
and constructing different things and

00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:39,650
and that's made available you can you

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,750
can find out how to construct for

00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,470
example this light rabbit you know which

00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:47,750
is a network that they set up and you

00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:49,280
can go and get the exact recipe for

00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,550
building anything you want there at all

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,250
it fell out there is open source so this

00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,870
is this is a major initiative there from

00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,450
you guys you know most of the open

00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:02,150
software initiatives but you can you're

00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:04,400
welcome to to take a look at that and

00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,630
you know this is this helps us continue

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,299
on our charter to our charge of 19

00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:12,390
before concerning our fondant was to do

00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:14,700
science for peace there's a time after

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,319
the war we brought together scientists

00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,549
from all over the globe who had been in

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,009
countries that have been fighting with

00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:21,569
each other and decided that we needed an

00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:24,569
open environment and I think pursued

00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:26,789
science and the name of peace and I

00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:30,380
think this openness and the environment

00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:32,700
asserted is trying to live up to them I

00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,490
hear so this is there's also a listing

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,470
of all the different projects easy to

00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,240
find a lot of different projects that

00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:43,490
are that are being done there's an open

00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:47,220
harbor license for their version 1.2 now

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:51,990
and and a self-described anything to go

00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,579
to me details on that finally to

00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,019
conclude our homage the last thing that

00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,900
we have which i think is perhaps one of

00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:59,519
the most important is open minds we get

00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,769
people from everywhere around the globe

00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,230
and that was the original idea and ask

00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:07,109
the idea were enforcing now people from

00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:11,309
every place come when we try to have as

00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:13,650
much diversity as possible and we're

00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:15,690
still pursuing that this is just a map

00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,750
that shows how the color countries there

00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,940
are have representatives on the Alice

00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,309
experiment the blue countries are where

00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,440
they have Institute's that are working

00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:28,519
on it and then the green countries have

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,410
those countries where people are from I

00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,029
just want to sort of give you just a

00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,430
little perspective before it before I

00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:40,250
finish up here this was an image taken

00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:45,329
laid back you guys remember voyagers

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:47,549
living out in the space okay

00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:49,619
the voyagers the two voyagers who

00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:51,869
remembers those things as patients and

00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:54,420
I'm okay so they they were no they did

00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:57,839
they've just reached the end of our

00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,220
solar system right and we know they're

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,730
from measuring the amount of charge

00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:05,039
particle flux from a sauna etc when it

00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,119
was the further these Rangers and they

00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,480
were built in the 70s

00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,789
right as they were leaving they have

00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,069
been designed to use energy from the Sun

00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:16,279
to take photographs and at the time this

00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:18,900
was a high-resolution photographs we got

00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:22,319
it was hell he was now trying to turn

00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:24,630
off the camera there's not enough power

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,390
to keep doing this we want them to send

00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:31,529
us data at very low rates of the data is

00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:33,180
coming in Carl Sagan said okay but I

00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:35,579
want you to take one last picture and

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,849
they took the Voyager and turn it around

00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:42,329
and Hannah take this one last picture if

00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:45,269
you look one brain on that picture up

00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:51,150
there at the top there that little tiny

00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:52,559
dude our dad sauce and he will I'm not

00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,170
going to hold him because he had such a

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,569
beautiful environment go look it up his

00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:00,240
quote was so beautiful the gist of it

00:47:57,569 --> 00:48:02,549
was that you know this is the thing that

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,499
we're fighting wars over you know a

00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:10,440
fraction of that grain this is what you

00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:12,989
know they're great leaders are arguing

00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,029
about some of them want to build walls

00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:19,799
that would fit on one grain he can't

00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:22,880
build a wall on one grain and his point

00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:25,890
was you know to sort of emphasize how

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,140
insignificant we are actually alchemy

00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:31,200
universe but gives you better freedom to

00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,279
realize that and if you look at that you

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,160
might think that we don't what's the

00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:38,519
point yeah with this one tiny buddy died

00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,769
in in surrounding one star which is one

00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,900
of a hundred billion stars of one galaxy

00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:46,200
you just one out of a hundred billion

00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,450
galaxies is it really reasonable for us

00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:52,470
to think that we will ever be able to

00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:57,599
understand this universe well I can say

00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:59,970
about my experiment is that these people

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,160
here you see a variety of them can see

00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,619
their faces these are my best friends

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,829
right 3,000 best friends on the

00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,220
documents work on this experiment who

00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:14,579
came together from all

00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:19,420
to build devices is incredibly complex

00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:20,980
these people there's a perhaps our best

00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,520
invention we're celebrating the Higgs

00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:28,200
boson survey these people think we can

00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:31,319
and I'm very happy to work with that

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,319
thank you

00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,950
so thank you very much

00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:46,540
do we have any questions Christine

00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:53,100
anyone else the quantum field theory

00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:55,540
please come on over

00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:01,750
people working in service engineers

00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:04,690
anomalies researchers the question was

00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:06,730
how many other people who think of a

00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:08,650
propulsion other people work in the

00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:12,540
service engineers of ammonia

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:16,230
none of them are researchers okay so

00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:22,660
serves an interesting place there's

00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:25,240
roughly 2,500 people who work force they

00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:30,010
get a paycheck of the answer now there's

00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:34,090
2,500 there's 13 or maybe 14 thousand

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:35,770
now work answer they're called users I'm

00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:40,290
one of those I'm a user or for the

00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:43,600
University of Melbourne look at excerpt

00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:46,000
they operate much like that like an

00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,790
airport let's say the airport is an

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,580
infrastructure so most of those 2,500

00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,500
are now physicists X is just a handful

00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:57,030
of physicists that actually work for

00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:59,920
soon most of them are engineers or

00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:02,860
there's technicians as well and support

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,690
staff so I don't really know the number

00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,100
exactly whatever I could imagine that

00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,950
there are hundreds if not a thousand

00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,420
engineers in the different areas so

00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,280
there's a lot of mechanical engineering

00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:15,490
electronic engineering and there's

00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,020
software engineer that's down there so

00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,260
it's definitely a place to look for if

00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:22,060
you're interested in finding a position

00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,390
there are frequently positions going on

00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,079
for

00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:30,250
to work for sir and then in addition at

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,109
the institutions that work there on the

00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:34,359
experiments somewhere about there

00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:36,549
because I'm working on experiments we

00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:38,490
use the facility we're like if that's

00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:41,380
the airport we're kind of an airline

00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:44,470
there were clients in the American

00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,819
structure we've organized together there

00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,769
are the plenty of Engineers but they're

00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:51,220
usually associated with the Institute's

00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:56,130
that are in this collaboration so our

00:51:51,220 --> 00:52:00,880
collaboration has 38 countries is 180

00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:03,130
institutes from around the globe and any

00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,140
of those need engineers to do the work

00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:07,930
to build the network we're building

00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:09,369
always as I said we're going to shut

00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,160
down at the end of this year and start

00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:24,940
installing new stuff I'm not great and

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:26,529
so there's engineers working on this one

00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,809
thing if you couldn't give us a specific

00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:30,279
example of the kind of research that one

00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:34,599
is doing and so in order to look for

00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:36,309
candidates for dark matter so to look

00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:41,279
for dark matter there's there are

00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:41,279
different ways in general

00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:02,290
yes there's an example image so when

00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:06,339
there's a collision here when there's a

00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:08,619
collision of the two protons there is

00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:10,990
Altima mentum is going like this

00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:13,119
there's no transverse momentum is

00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:16,900
repelled transverse energy so if you add

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:20,109
up all of the tracks here you can get

00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:22,089
their momentum in never to 0 the vector

00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:23,109
is yet is there a similar for the energy

00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:26,589
there should be a balance of energy

00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:28,210
overall energy and so the first thing

00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:31,420
you just do is you look for events where

00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:32,859
there is an imbalance you have something

00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,150
left something with you the detector

00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:35,859
that we couldn't measure we didn't

00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,900
measure now there can be reasons for

00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:39,670
death it can be your detectors detectors

00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,390
are not perfect but there's a very very

00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:43,060
but they're pretty

00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:44,910
permettre so you know it is very much

00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,589
there and you can model that precisely

00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,780
um you also know there are particles

00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:51,369
called neutrinos make sure those pass

00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,099
through without us being able to measure

00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:57,160
them well the standard model can model

00:53:54,099 --> 00:54:00,300
that we know is that the our spectrum of

00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,580
missing energy what it should look like

00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,440
if you take and subtract that and you

00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:08,170
still look at that plot and you see that

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,390
there's some peak somewhere something

00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,089
where you have missing energy that adds

00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:15,070
up for example to the mass what you'd

00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:16,990
expect from the mass of a proton that

00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,550
tells me you've got something so one

00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:21,670
sense you just look you look for missing

00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:23,380
energy on the other end you something a

00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,640
little more sophisticated there's models

00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:28,089
out there there's actually a whole

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,070
framework of theory that's called

00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:31,990
supersymmetry which is a very

00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:35,880
fascinating idea that's been out for

00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:37,769
decades now that we've only really found

00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,630
the particles for every one of the

00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:41,849
fermions that matter particles there's a

00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,589
boson which is a forced remark on

00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:45,180
forever one of the both sides of the

00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:49,319
permanence of it we'd only found half

00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:53,609
the things and it it's a model which

00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:56,430
would help bring in all the forces these

00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:59,339
things predict that there should be

00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:01,680
partners out there which are the most

00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:06,990
least massive particle which we won't

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:09,180
see and so they they get specific

00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,970
predictions depending on the exact model

00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:14,059
on the exact theory there's a framework

00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:17,009
and there's a variety different

00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:18,720
parameters that framework and assessee

00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:20,720
some people what they do is they look at

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,009
those and they search for those specific

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,599
signatures

00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:25,799
you know images like this they look for

00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,940
those when they don't see it then you

00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:31,799
can eliminate that and supersymmetry has

00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,859
had a lot of space eliminated we're down

00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:37,259
to a little area where can still exist

00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:47,720
and may continue to look at the more

00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:47,720
specific to do those two events

00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:55,829
can you explain briefly in what is seen

00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:59,069
those amici's well sure sure

00:55:55,829 --> 00:56:02,359
oh so yeah actually I put this up here

00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:06,839
so you guys all know there's um so our

00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:08,339
detectors are made up very good luck so

00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:11,009
if I go back one

00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:12,779
there's our detector I don't have the

00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:15,089
image that shows what's inside whatever

00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:16,849
deer there's a hundred million channels

00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:18,019
of information more than otherwise

00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:21,319
integration that comes from our

00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:22,940
detective said one up I explained us

00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:27,019
it's pretty much the same for the others

00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:30,229
Atlas at the very inside you have a lot

00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:31,869
of silicon via pixels there about 80

00:56:30,229 --> 00:56:35,180
million of our channels are not a

00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:38,779
cylinder and the very inside there and

00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:41,660
other pixels which are high in eyes so

00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:43,549
we use two things be to two concepts you

00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,769
have to know to build a detector one is

00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:48,019
that a charged particle will curve in a

00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:49,460
magnetic field and the other is that

00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:51,920
there are certain materials which will

00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,869
ionize we charge particles to meaning

00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,359
that electrons will go only on the ions

00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:59,479
will go another and so we use that and

00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:02,619
on the inside we have a trapping chamber

00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:05,479
which has a lot of chips in there pixels

00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:07,700
when a charged particle goes through it

00:57:05,479 --> 00:57:10,009
lights them up and we take the electrons

00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,239
out and you read that out okay so we

00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,859
know that it's something got through

00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:16,390
here something that through here or

00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:18,710
there and when you see all of these dots

00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:22,190
then we make pattern recognition

00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:24,650
software in 3d which can make a trap

00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:26,589
from them or make the best possible trap

00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:29,809
from all of the dots that are in there

00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:31,369
those are the traps you see also outside

00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:33,289
that this big thing here that's being

00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:35,569
pushed in

00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:39,440
that's a calorimeter that stops

00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:40,549
particles and measures energy so

00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,739
measures the energy of those particles

00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:44,989
are scintillator there are other stuff

00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:46,220
which which the amount of light that

00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:48,320
comes out will tell you what the

00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,240
to the partner went into it then on the

00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,830
very outside we have new on chambers

00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,800
because we want to go through that and

00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:57,950
they again ionize they have a gas inside

00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:59,660
the tube and a choir and a high voltage

00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,730
and so the electrons go to the wire so

00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:04,310
you can use ionization and you get a

00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:07,460
bunch of circles in this case which you

00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:11,300
draw the software makes a track through

00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:13,580
and then you get images like this so

00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:16,160
this shows you the traps on the inside

00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:18,080
so this is a protons point of view so a

00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,570
proton was going like this and sees its

00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,510
best friend exploding in front of it and

00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:24,980
and so you see that it produces many

00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:29,330
different it might have produced

00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:31,220
something in this case true honest most

00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:33,619
the most likely scenario for this image

00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:36,890
here is that two of the gluons things to

00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:42,080
hold together the quirks interactive and

00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:45,710
they produce a quark which then produced

00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:48,560
Higgs boson and that is boson then also

00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:52,250
produce some quarks which then gave us

00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:56,480
two Z bosons I'm reading all of this

00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:59,540
manner which indicate to four electrons

00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,580
two pairs of electrons so we know you

00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,190
know we have to go backwards we dealing

00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,599
we just sort of investigation from what

00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:08,240
we see on the outside to try to figure

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,150
out the inside it's a fun part of this

00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:15,170
peasant bird doesn't allow us into them

00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:17,240
you don't hurt their you just will never

00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:19,609
be able to go there there's a certain

00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,640
uncertainty that just no precise

00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:24,410
detector can get beyond so we don't ever

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,090
see really what happened at the center

00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,610
for we

00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:30,280
go backwards to me only and they figure

00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:32,140
out after meeting the theorists here is

00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,030
the theorists live in the center there

00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,920
and they tell us this is what you can

00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,870
expect will happen and if we count

00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,090
essentially all we do is we count we

00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:43,650
counted it comes out here and he has to

00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,650
match with their theory if it doesn't

00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,420
[Music]

01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:13,800
thinking if you need for your research

01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:23,830
yeah much of what we do some of these

01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:27,130
sort of citizen science and what we put

01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:28,840
out whether they open open data as

01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:32,710
theirs to Lasserre one can go on and

01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:35,380
play around with it it's it's all public

01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:40,900
on our site so for a penis is simply

01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:43,690
open data have this down sir and you

01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,070
know people who are expert solution

01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:47,770
there and definitely invited that

01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:49,900
partnership but anybody who wants to try

01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:53,110
can't go and try things out if they

01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:57,160
watching and if answered your question

01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:59,650
you know do you have like a list of

01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,120
things that you you think up with a list

01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:07,150
of live our wish list and things

01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:09,130
together I'm guessing that you could do

01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:11,730
some pattern recognition software that

01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:14,680
could get all the conclusions

01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:17,410
automatically from the image yes sir you

01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:20,590
look at well but that's essentially what

01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:22,090
we do I mean we do we do have we have

01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:26,530
software engineers who are

01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:31,180
Sothis and and yeah it is it is being a

01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:32,920
pattern recognition software so that's

01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:36,700
that's how we figure out these tracks

01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:38,740
are belonging to it's the environments

01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,650
even messier than this because as I

01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:45,310
mentioned you know we get like 25 30 or

01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:47,830
40 collisions each time each time we see

01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,880
one of those if I turn this sideways you

01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,290
would see that there were many other

01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,140
collisions happening at the same time

01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,240
and we have to actually not just match

01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,670
these tracks in this dimension but we

01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:59,140
have to eliminate all the ones that were

01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,820
produced by the other collisions

01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:02,830
happening at the same time so it's

01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:06,360
really really a strong challenge there's

01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:06,360
always room for people to come

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,619
