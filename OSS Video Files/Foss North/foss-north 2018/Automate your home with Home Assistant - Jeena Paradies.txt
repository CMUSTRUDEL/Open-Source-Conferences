Title: Automate your home with Home Assistant - Jeena Paradies
Publication date: 2018-04-24
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	There are quite many closed solutions for home automation like Telekom's agenta SmartHome, Google Home, Apples HomePod, etc. What most of them have in common is that they don't like to play with the rest of the eco system.
Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform running on Python 3 with a humongous amount of integration into all sorts of systems. Track and control all devices at home and automate control. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi.
In this talk Jeena will explain how he automated his home, what hardware he used and what it took to integrate it with Home Assistant.

---

Over the last 17 years Jeena has contributed to many open web projects. He works at Luxoft as a embedded Linux developer where he found his interest in embedded and IoT devices.

	00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:20,430
there's this oh it's looking nice

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,400
hello everybody yeah I'm Richard on the

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,650
internet and Gina and I would like to

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,680
show you how I opted emitted my home

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,449
basically and I didn't where the

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,220
software is called home system

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,800
so let's get started so let me first

00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,190
talk about the alternatives which you

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,870
most of your gun like this Google home

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:51,000
and Apple home thought and the automaker

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:53,340
they have very convenient because it's

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,980
it's done for for the consumers so you

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,000
don't need to do it everything yourself

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,399
setting up finding the right software

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,259
and hardware so everything connects

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,320
automatically and so on but of course

00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:13,020
everything is happening in the cloud on

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,920
that so you speak to it it sends

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,220
everything to home and then hopefully

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,830
you get something back because there are

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,770
nice-looking bricks if the internet goes

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,900
down so if something happens to the

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,900
internet you can use your motivation

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:38,939
yeah so the problem I have with them the

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,030
biggest problem is obviously the sending

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,860
back funding back home but also they

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,200
have not really an incentive to

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,700
integrate with other brands hardware so

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,610
you need to to basically take what they

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,030
offer you and then just go with it and

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,750
just give them more money basically

00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,750
there are nice alternative

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:11,709
not usable wisdom so what this home

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:15,370
assistant it's a central software which

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:17,260
you run on on a device that you hope it

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:22,180
doesn't need to be internet connected

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,099
but it can this is for events which are

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,230
happening or Omaha on different hardware

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:34,650
and it triggers alternations with you

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,650
which you prepare basically or programs

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,110
and also it looks everything what is

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:47,170
happening so you can go back in time and

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:50,080
and and make graphs or whatever so the

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,170
front end is written in in the journals

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,569
live library called polymer and it uses

00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:01,209
that component which what are quite a

00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:04,480
new thing they they kind of fuse the

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:08,440
global material design guidance to to

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,890
make it and the really nice thing about

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,950
homo system is that it's written in the

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:18,160
back end is written apart so you can run

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,890
it basically on whatever hardware you

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,769
want which just needs to support - which

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,959
is like from our from an old rusty pipe

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,959
up to a dancer

00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:41,550
it has 1,000 integration to us with

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:44,190
different hardware software around and

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,800
it has a really really big community

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,230
yeah I will come back to most of the

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:56,790
points later yeah let's look at the UI

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:59,400
so that's mine when I open home

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:06,420
assistant at home or basically in a

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:09,840
browser I see this which has like this

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,650
sidebar which was more like deeper for

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,980
the logbook developer tools and stuff

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:20,010
and at the center that is all the way up

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,870
the set source you can see that my

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,700
kitchen sensor doesn't work

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,310
two kids in temperature sensor doesn't

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:32,640
work I could see the kids in temperature

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:34,980
history it's also broken I when I was

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,960
fiddling with with it with the sensor I

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,570
broke it like now we can go out they

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,640
didn't really have time to fix it but

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:46,980
more than later then I have like still

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:54,000
Christmas lights because they are nice

00:04:46,980 --> 00:05:03,750
to have some power switches I have CCTV

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:14,630
cam oh yeah lights and a camera also the

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:18,180
camera shows up to there if it's okay so

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,660
if you would like to test it or like

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,810
install it then there is a nice sub

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,400
product of my sisterhood Shadid it's

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:32,990
called has I know which is image switch

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,729
you just flash on your Raspberry Pi and

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,909
they they have like

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:43,740
see an app store with extensions which

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:45,870
are implemented as token images which is

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,409
nice because then if some stuff

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,809
extension goes wild that it doesn't

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:54,120
doesn't break everything it just breaks

00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:57,650
the one thing which because of the

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,499
containment it has automatic updates

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:05,279
which is also realized with those docker

00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:08,039
images which is super nice but obviously

00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,219
wants what you can all that route it's

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,919
much more difficult to take care of in

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:16,889
the software itself because everything

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,439
is hitting in in containers and you need

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:24,180
to understand the whole stack of docker

00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:26,629
to get around so the idea for has is

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:32,999
basically to to make it easier for

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:36,860
normal people to to start with it and

00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:41,069
they because home assistant has a lot of

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:44,939
UI for programming of dimensions looking

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:50,149
at data and so on so you don't don't

00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:53,159
need that much like knowledge about deep

00:06:50,149 --> 00:07:00,930
suits happening stuff just to just to

00:06:53,159 --> 00:07:06,930
run it or to configure it so let's look

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:13,529
at my really small table setup so you've

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:16,889
seen the UI and it's I do have let's

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:20,099
start on the left so they have its

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,759
random running on the Raspberry Pi which

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:29,039
is connected to the Ethernet cable and

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:34,470
it's connected to Sun boards which is

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:39,050
their what it's connected to

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:43,370
stick to one which is discontinued so

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:46,230
tenders doesn't doesn't sell it anymore

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,780
because they came up with a new version

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:54,480
which is connected to the Internet

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:58,410
this one is just plain USB to 433

00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,690
megahertz and it's doesn't speak doesn't

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,960
form home or anything and they sold it

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,680
for half price like for half a year so a

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:12,990
lot of people go it's just for that then

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:15,480
I have so the tenth stick they stop

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,740
clinging to the Nexus which is which

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:22,050
many of you might know I had those Nexus

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,790
with just already before before I

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:29,280
started worse before I started with with

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,590
the tenderest automation because I

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,919
wanted to switch off everything at my

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,190
desk or everything by my TV with one

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,469
button when I go out and switch on

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,560
everything by one bottom and not going

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:49,650
around and pressing all the buttons just

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:58,770
to save energy then the light bulb

00:08:49,650 --> 00:09:02,490
I bought Wi-Fi enabled once which which

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:08,820
have open protocol so it's already

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:11,550
integrated in a home assistant it's

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,870
called a light it's some Chinese company

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,690
but it's nice of that

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:22,910
to offer open protocol so everybody can

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:25,550
talk to the laptops if they want to

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,820
basically they need to be on the same

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:34,960
Wi-Fi because yeah obvious reasons and

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:40,130
then we have more I have a menu button

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:44,750
which I used to take state of my flat

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:48,230
basically so I want to take state for if

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm asleep or not basically then the

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:59,660
thermometer here is also home eight as

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:05,540
you can see the Christmas night had done

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:08,029
I use the switches for for for like that

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,880
like Christmas lights and the TV and

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:14,690
stuff like this just do safe energy and

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:21,170
I use for for for the text in the car at

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:23,540
home or not is my fault so let's see

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:31,779
about a little bit about the software

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:35,089
setup so I roll it on raspbian OS

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:38,060
because I didn't want to use as I don't

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:43,220
deserve to have more control over the

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:46,930
software so I just run normal raspbian

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:53,860
OS and the next home assistant on it

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:58,270
which which which just saw with our

00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:07,970
thing a pip install yes

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:13,959
and the light others box which this

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:19,400
protocol then tildes has also a driver

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:24,140
and some some utilities for the command

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,690
line which are written in C++ which is

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,990
nice

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:33,870
that you can compile it for Windows Mac

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:39,150
or Linux and so those are used for to

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:41,310
talk to the testing tool they used to be

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,340
done obesity which that talks to

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:48,480
everything else this axis which is

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:51,470
basically and then the rest of the the

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,690
software which are small parts i've

00:11:51,470 --> 00:12:00,240
myself written with with arduino ide

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:05,850
because i used that's mostly software

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:12,440
for for that small ESP 86 32 chips those

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:15,800
might have smoked my first juice okay so

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:20,450
just a couple of steps how i set it up

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,010
basically installed all there's also our

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,030
special version of rescue logistical

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,960
task yeah

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,750
which has already which is rescue but

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,240
with our system pre-installed and

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:38,910
pre-configured so you just build it up

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:44,130
wait for five minute and for you the you

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:47,220
i just saw so basically the i myself

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,450
it compiled a list of the 10 discover

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:56,940
software which talks to the tannest ik

00:12:50,450 --> 00:13:00,990
because the the packages I found just

00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:09,360
just didn't work so I have

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:12,750
copilot myself with then before the

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:19,350
presence detection I use my phone and

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:20,100
see if if if so so on there are three

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,530
pipe

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,150
I have there are three by three so it

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:29,750
does have Bluetooth and therefore I can

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:33,810
look for for my phone if the phone is

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:38,550
close by or not and that's quite nice if

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:41,910
thanks I have a fairly small flat so so

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,970
when I when I come from from somewhere

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:49,140
with my signal I see that everything it

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,690
mark lapis there's lights and then I'm

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,650
coming closer and closer and then like

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,850
perhaps 20 meters from of that

00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:01,800
everything lights up now what comes to

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:04,920
do basically so it's nice but yes it's

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,880
on configure Blues on the Raspberry Pi

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,690
and then I configure the home assistance

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,210
for for the hard one I have and that's

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,420
obviously are not a contacting because

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,030
you always want to that one must think

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,170
to it so you work all the time of the

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:29,270
configuration I make it better and so

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:33,660
then I brought some simple optimizations

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:37,080
like like a clock in the moments so in

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:41,250
the morning at 6:00 when I'm supposed to

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:46,430
wake up the lights in my in my sleeping

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:50,610
gas goes on to to make my ethnicity and

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:55,770
then I built those the Wi-Fi thermometer

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:57,540
and button with time and then I

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:01,670
configured them obviously to be used

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:05,970
our system itself so let's talk about

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:10,259
presence detector so in houma system the

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:14,040
the for me the most important thing is

00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,819
that it knows that I'm at home or I'm

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,579
not at all

00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:20,850
because depending on if I'm at home or

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:24,360
if I'm coming home they are going away I

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:30,509
want to run different alternations for

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:34,680
example when I leave home I want I

00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:37,560
wanted to to switch off everything like

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,769
my everything on my desk because I don't

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,589
need it so why should it be long before

00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:45,509
that I just I went everywhere press the

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:48,800
button and now I don't need to do it

00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:52,889
anymore and I am still not quite there

00:15:48,800 --> 00:16:00,420
where I switch off everything because

00:15:52,889 --> 00:16:02,250
the microwave might be a thing which I

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,480
would switch off everything with

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,160
basically takes energy or or Iran or

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,970
something like that it will be nice to

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,690
have a peace of mind that ok even if I

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,029
forgot the IRA I can still go into my

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:23,510
phone and switch it off or else which is

00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:23,510
it of automatically when I leave home

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:32,240
but there is more to presence detection

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:36,630
because you can do it with different

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,110
technologies so a magic Bluetooth Low

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,680
Energy

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:44,760
to see if I'm at the or not but you

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,339
could also use your Wi-Fi router because

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:52,260
if once you come home your phone

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:55,920
normally connects to your Wi-Fi and that

00:16:52,260 --> 00:17:00,029
can be detected and that can be used as

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,870
a process detector there are also many

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:06,819
many more

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:10,039
on our biggest scale which use GPS I

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:13,579
used on trucks for awhile which in

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:17,480
theory is super cool because value you

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,270
it still it all tricks is like an app on

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,539
your phone which which which looks at

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,990
the location and it just sends your

00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:34,070
location via HTTP to your home assistant

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:37,940
or HTTP or mqtt basically so if you use

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:42,409
HTTP on your on your home a system that

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:45,200
is secure and tell me you oh it's only

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:50,000
on your devices basically which which

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:54,110
traverses shared and but my problem was

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,710
that it didn't quite detect that I came

00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,289
home or went away it always backed a lot

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,320
and then sometimes it just showed that

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:07,070
I'm like 200 meters away from my flat

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,990
when I wasn't so it wasn't that useful

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:16,390
for me at least and then Google Maps

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,390
just basically the same but instead of

00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,830
you know in Google Maps you can change

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:25,520
your current location either for one

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:28,610
hour five hours or indefinitely so what

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,960
you what people came up with is you just

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,350
create another Google comto and then you

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,140
just share with this one and this one

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,450
gets integrated into homo system and

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,179
then you can always see the next thing

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,360
with this is that Google doesn't doesn't

00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:50,419
do it like contracts wages stars of the

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,100
application looks for the GPS signal

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:55,100
that says you

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,310
the whole information and that's us now

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,530
but Google because they they do the

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:07,340
whole Android thing obviously they can

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:09,380
manage to borrow bundle applications

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,640
which wants to know whether you are

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,890
together and just make it like once for

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,730
like just call once and I'll give that

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,590
information to everyone which is which

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:27,590
preserves the battery much better on

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:29,660
your phone at least so also if you know

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,480
where people are then you could do

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,840
something like if your even for children

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,290
flexibly won't know that they arrived at

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:43,910
school or that they arrived at home that

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:47,720
you can make songs like radius thingy on

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:51,020
your map and that you you could either

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,880
do confirmation if someone gives it to

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,090
the whole song of the school zone or

00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,050
whatever or you can also obviously just

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:02,360
send yourself aha Thomas's APIs push

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:05,750
notifications on or something like that

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,800
so that's that's interesting if you if

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,800
you have more people

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:22,740
okay let's go to the next one which is

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:25,820
like the the easiest use case to come up

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:30,720
with for home alternate measure so

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:32,970
everybody even I myself had was like

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,360
this also at the beginning so yeah I

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,790
like the idea home all tonight Shalu but

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,920
what will I come to me I don't know the

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,520
only thing I came up with this this the

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:48,150
light saw but it's kind of weird that

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,520
you need to take you out your phone and

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,190
as which one open of the light but you

00:20:50,520 --> 00:21:01,710
could just use the light switch what's

00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:04,370
easier it was natural to use but it

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:09,630
doesn't matter I still did it

00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,580
so this is how how easy I set it up yeah

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:16,410
so it's the easiest to set up because

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:20,210
you you buy like a Wi-Fi in both and put

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,280
it in and then they're just connected to

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,070
they most often have like an app where

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,400
you can put in your Wi-Fi password and

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:32,429
stuff like this and they're connected

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,630
and then they are on the Wi-Fi with was

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:39,450
there my P so you can send messages to

00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:45,630
ask that for for the state to stop like

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:48,540
this it's fairly expensive to replace

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:53,400
all the license asleep in my flat I have

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:57,710
like six lights which I replaced every

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:02,429
light bulb costs between 200

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:05,580
600 Cronus and especially if you want to

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:07,950
do it user friendly then you will

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,020
normally don't wants to just replace

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,960
their bulb but the state you want to

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,120
replace and switch so that it doesn't

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,700
matter if you use a switch all the bulb

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,679
because tune-up right now like I have it

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,140
now because I don't live in my home

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,480
house I live in a flat and I want to

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,210
take care of it because number six I did

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,760
the bulbs but the switch would be nice

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:33,030
because then you could either use the

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,240
app or some automation or everyone else

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:39,210
but still use the normal switches right

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,080
now I have it I have to leave everything

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:45,360
off so so the electricity goes to the

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,390
light month because obviously if I

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:53,850
switch this switch off no electricity

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:56,039
it's kept switch so it's it's a big

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,260
problem when I have parties because

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,530
people come in and just switch the light

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:07,830
on or off and everything is but I

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:10,110
try to explain why and so on it's a cool

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,650
thing to to basically show off your

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:16,110
automation because you can do you can

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:20,700
you can program the lights to blink or

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:23,549
in different colors so homo system has

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,909
like some some pre-programmed programs

00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:30,960
value when you can make your lights look

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:34,289
like the police is coming or it has the

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,240
Facebook color or if some message cancel

00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,000
Facebook or something like that so it's

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,950
cool in a party when you do the music

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,900
thing and everybody's dancing and then

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:47,130
you can have different colors like this

00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,250
critics it's everybody is just amazed

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,500
even

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:55,540
it's the thing and you can in Hamas's

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,200
that they can group everything into

00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:02,620
groups so I grouped a couple of my light

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:11,260
source of sound so I can switch them one

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:14,320
of differently yeah as I said before I

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:18,730
looked a long time for four light bulbs

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:22,750
which offer a local protocol so I can

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:25,690
myself either programs and program them

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,390
or just write something which suit which

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,820
can connect to them as I said at the

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:35,620
beginning the the other ones they don't

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:39,550
want to don't want to connect to others

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:43,060
and let's let have us how to might make

00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:47,400
themselves on so it's a bit of a hassle

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:54,270
in my opinion to find the right thing to

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:59,170
to be able to do what he wants to do yes

00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:03,960
so yeah exactly programmatic reverse

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:07,210
which is some more on wireless

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,540
technologies so obviously we've seen

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:17,530
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi which everybody

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:25,810
knows but we also have the low power

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:34,060
device 403 33 megahertz technology

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:35,260
basically which is UHF band which is in

00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,950
which license

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,450
so communication wise you don't need to

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:45,500
get

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:49,080
license to use it and it was used for CP

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:52,590
so citizen that radio basically or is

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,929
still used because everybody can just

00:25:52,590 --> 00:26:02,490
use this bath to to do whatever they

00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:04,559
want but it it has not no common

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:09,269
protocol so everybody just makes the

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,250
protocol so you need to see so the Nexus

00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:13,440
which is works I have an open protocol

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,960
and many people have known access which

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:21,929
is already at home so it's a nice first

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:27,899
step for automation yeah so then we have

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:32,330
the ZigBee which is a open protocol it's

00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:32,330
on a much higher its shaakira

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:41,149
gigahertz i don't remember exactly where

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:45,269
it's the factor the ZigBee Alliance so

00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:48,210
which is which is nice because it's not

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:54,510
a per protocol the everybody can

00:26:48,210 --> 00:27:00,330
implement it if they want to a dementia

00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:05,789
it creates a mesh network so which means

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:10,279
that even if something is far away you

00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:14,210
use you can get the information by going

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:19,350
through the edges basically so you can

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:22,260
you can go from from your kitchen to

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,960
your living room and then from there to

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,149
the sleeping you know for example even

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,549
if the sleeping room would be too far

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:34,110
away for something like their own power

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:38,940
device thingy so which is really cool if

00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:42,570
you have like a house or like something

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,870
bigger enough that's mostly will work

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:48,030
with no power devices but every single

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,640
little umeå it's nice to have mesh

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,790
network without setting up everything

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:59,150
for itself combining everything it just

00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:02,550
doesn't automatically and the most the

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:06,660
philips hue which most of you probably

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:10,110
know this those philips language they

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:15,780
use it also on than this

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:20,880
z-wave it's a closed protocol a you can

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:24,060
read it if your customer to them but

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:29,640
it's a much much easier to implement

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:34,170
practical than the ZigBee because degree

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:39,690
has the profiles and yeah it's it's more

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:46,230
complicated it also has this mesh

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:51,120
network technology where the same as

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:54,510
dick do basically yeah so but i'm I

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,850
myself I'm still a beginner and this

00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:02,700
automation figure so I'm still on the

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:05,640
low power device side but I guess if I

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:13,890
guess that I would go for ZigBee as well

00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:19,890
next just because so I told you already

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:21,770
that I absolutely started by just

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:27,020
switching off everything

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:29,540
and go from home yeah so my TV I have

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:33,860
like my music apps in different rooms

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:36,110
where play music I switch off the Wi-Fi

00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:40,190
access point because if I'm not around

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:42,950
it doesn't need to to work obviously the

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,900
computer and the screen my Christmas

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,940
night and I even switch of the ethernet

00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,940
switches because I don't need them

00:29:49,120 --> 00:30:05,210
everything is basically put it to one

00:29:53,170 --> 00:30:09,020
what do you call it like this here in

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:13,100
the future I want to have the kitchen

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,830
stove to it because most important for a

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,910
peace of mind so it happened to me one

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:22,760
time that that I went for wrong I have

00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:26,059
said my my food on the on the stove I

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,570
went for a run I don't like these and it

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:33,950
was Sunday something evenings I tried to

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:36,440
call the guys who can open your door but

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:40,309
nobody was there and I was really afraid

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:44,510
that start a fire so I have to throw a

00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:47,000
stone into a window just to come in into

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,950
the flat with something like that I

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,340
could just switch it off from the

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,890
outside which would be nice as I said

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,100
the Ivan is exactly the same problem you

00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:01,250
you go away from your flat perhaps you

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:05,900
go you just a what sound something and

00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:09,710
go for a long journey and that is the

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:12,679
case the horrible case of you can switch

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,580
it on/off and the microwave that sound

00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,830
like this so those here comes see the

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,590
Nexus which is nicely which is basically

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:26,730
you take it

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:30,070
just interject and it's it has on a

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:40,179
relay needs I can hear it click with

00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:47,409
that periodicity so populations which

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:50,789
are the heart of the system I don't have

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:54,580
very many but they are really fun to

00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:57,460
have basically I told you already about

00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:02,070
my alarm clock which just switches on

00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:07,299
the light of the morning to wake me up I

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:12,279
have a good morning automation well when

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:15,460
I trigger so normally yeah it's a bit

00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:19,059
complicated but the sleeping turbo is

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:22,120
one automation what is that automates

00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:24,429
either good morning oh good night but I

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,520
can I can trigger it from different

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:28,750
directions I will talk about this later

00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,059
but basically the good morning

00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,820
automation just switches on the

00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:37,450
nightstand and every signature needs

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:40,360
through the day the good night one is

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:44,860
switches off the light obviously and the

00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:47,830
TV and computer and everything so Gina

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:54,100
coming home is basically like I told you

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:56,590
before everything goes on but yeah it's

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,529
it's not very different to to the good

00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:04,140
morning but it's a different trigger

00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:07,049
basically to it and then the train alarm

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:11,640
which tells me that the train is going

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:16,210
suit so I should leave so let's see

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:21,809
let's look at the UI so there are like

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,809
three steps to it a trigger

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:31,150
the condition and then elected so let's

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:36,350
just see on the trip see the trigger and

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:39,050
action so this is a screenshot from from

00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:43,280
my alternation when I'm Jeannette coming

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:46,220
home so the trigger is the state of the

00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,990
entity device Turkey Galaxy s8 reduce my

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:55,160
phone changes from home to not home if

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,950
that happens then I do those three

00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:02,300
pictures the first one is called the

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:07,220
service home automation turn off on the

00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:10,700
entity ID group power switches I turn

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:14,240
off all the power sources then the

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:18,919
second one is called service also but

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:23,300
instead of home assistant for the entity

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:30,409
I take the the group lights and turn

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:34,280
them all off and then the third is take

00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:43,760
the switch with identity IDs which CCTV

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:46,720
cam and switch it on so just - just so

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,020
you can you can also have conditions

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,500
here I have a condition of three

00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:59,990
conditions which is for my automation

00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:05,720
for the train is leaving so so it gets

00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:10,430
triggered by a tiger and the time the

00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,710
conditions for the timer so so after the

00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,560
timer has triggered those three

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:18,500
conditions needs to be met so the device

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:25,370
you can access eight as my home should

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:28,820
be in the state home then the state of

00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,390
the pintle boolean it's just over there

00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,440
because

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:35,940
it's yeah it's some internal stuff in

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:42,089
in-home assistant when American sets

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:45,480
like it loose and then I have one which

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:47,309
is called sleeping which I put to home

00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,789
and office on if I'm sleeping then it's

00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:50,819
on

00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:55,099
otherwise it's off so I need to be at

00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:58,799
home I need to not be still sleeping and

00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:02,190
it needs to be between so after six

00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:04,920
o'clock and before 11 o'clock and only

00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:09,230
if all those are met then we'll cover

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:13,710
the service which is pickle

00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:15,660
text-to-speech and we let it say Gina

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,539
the Train girls at 7 minutes if you

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,309
don't go now we'll be late so I hear it

00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:22,309
and emotions yeah

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:33,749
configuration so many things are

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:37,890
possible in the UI but everything else

00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:41,970
it should be done in beyond the config

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:45,329
files Norma hardware configuration has

00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:47,880
the soils in the next life in DTC or

00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:52,109
somewhere else so I have example

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,539
configuration here so in EML format on

00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:57,119
the right so that the best device record

00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:00,499
which is which defines a platform which

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:05,309
is a Bluetooth tracker which is just a

00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:08,130
type of tracker and it should not strap

00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:13,349
your devices because I only want to look

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:15,660
at but you can try to get new devices in

00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:19,020
that we were

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:22,740
find it automatically and so then they

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:26,220
have want to connect my promises that

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,319
you are ktt broker which is also running

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,240
on the same machine but it could run on

00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:35,910
the internet or whatever and you can see

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,950
here it this username and password which

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,490
asked to work not in the configuration

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:44,640
file but in a secrets file with because

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:48,510
many people save the configuration in

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:53,160
get on github or somewhere and you just

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:55,819
put your secrets file in getting more

00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,569
and don't be to think about that you're

00:37:55,819 --> 00:38:04,440
pushing your passwords to be done and

00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:07,980
then here also the lights I use ye light

00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,480
and there's a integration for this and I

00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,720
have a couple of devices which have

00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,500
their IP addresses so what I did is for

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,599
every level

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:21,450
I picked the IP address to the lab mode

00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,160
in my router so it doesn't change even

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:28,680
even if if we switch it off all the

00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:31,440
powers or something like that and I just

00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,099
gave them their names like a bathroom of

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,099
the Romans

00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:55,140
so let's see my security cam at home

00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:58,710
mostly for testing but it's also nice to

00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,640
be able to see if everything is still

00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,970
okay at home

00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,070
because I've been traveling out for for

00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:08,730
longer periods and I can just have a

00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:11,580
quick look it's only on so it only gets

00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:16,050
power when I'm at home so that's

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:19,260
basically the very very first idea of my

00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:21,750
nose I would like something like cam at

00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,920
home but not it should automatically

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,680
switch themselves

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,410
suit yourself off when I'm when I'm

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,670
coming home and it should automatically

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:36,420
go on when I leave for that I need it's

00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,520
a kernel system and it turns out for my

00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,440
system it's really really great for

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:46,530
doing stuff like that automations like

00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:49,800
this this particular one and I have also

00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:53,040
tested many of them I want also to use

00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,700
the protocol not something was just

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,820
works with ActiveX some old internet

00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,310
explorer and so it uses the only

00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,310
protocol so you can you can use

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:07,050
different apps for that I can move it to

00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:10,220
left and right up and down with them

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:15,510
like this it has a nice mjpeg stream

00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:18,300
which which I can directly view the

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:21,420
browser or the host promises that unite

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,450
you don't again wants to have something

00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:29,960
special which is which only works in

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:34,050
ActiveX thingy which still many of those

00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:39,020
do and it does also movement detection

00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:39,020
which sets me a notification on my phone

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:45,690
so I have those two states in my lap and

00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,730
they're present which is done by my

00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:53,540
phone

00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:56,270
Bluetooth it does I don't need to pair

00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:59,680
it it just looks at the signature okay

00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:04,220
this is somewhere close or not and

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,470
another state is am i sleeping and I I

00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,599
[Music]

00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:11,720
for a long time I have to go into home

00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:14,119
assistant on my phone or my on my laptop

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,730
and has to press the button

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:22,099
okay now I'm literally going to sleep or

00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:25,490
now I woke up but two weeks ago I I made

00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:29,030
a button for it which sends a good team

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:33,589
message so two home assistant on route

00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:36,380
when it boots up it censored so I just

00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:41,930
press the button I go to sleep and when

00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:45,650
I wake up so that's the button the

00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:48,980
ethernet thingy just for comparison a

00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:53,119
little it can get it's really really

00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:57,130
nice and small so that's also my first

00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:03,760
open source hardware which I'm proud of

00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:06,950
because I still wanted to both for me is

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,829
to understand how this all works and

00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,900
also for me later to to be able to go

00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:16,089
back and build something else out of it

00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:20,390
so I wanted to document it nicely so

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:24,859
it's on github for both the schematics

00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:28,490
the software it's gplv3

00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:30,680
and yeah it consumes me hopefully

00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,660
minimum amount of energy because only

00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,510
two runs for like two seconds when you

00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,390
press the button it loose knocks it into

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:43,310
the Wi-Fi sense they have guilty teep

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:45,880
message and yourself it has a really

00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,770
long lag for for doing that

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,990
the whole process and every citizen to

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:56,920
put one second from pressing the button

00:42:49,990 --> 00:43:01,950
until the lights go on or off let's just

00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:04,960
quickly look at the source code it's

00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:10,180
nothing special basically I use a couple

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:15,400
of libraries just to see them into the

00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:18,280
Wi-Fi and do a couple of tests until it

00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:25,420
it's connected then I connected them

00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:28,920
t.server down there and I just said

00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,680
publish the topic of the content and

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:37,000
disconnect and that go to the ESB deep

00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:40,690
sleep for a thing it's like 40 years or

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,600
something but obviously hopefully before

00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:45,600
that I think the batteries run out or

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,000
that I have the kitchen temperature

00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:59,500
which doesn't work right now but when I

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,880
have ice party weekend I had it running

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:07,270
and it showed his graphs so here the

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,700
first spike is on the Saturday at like

00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:14,320
10 o'clock where I started cleaning and

00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:17,640
then people came about about one and it

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:22,750
started to get hotter and hotter

00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:27,220
reported through the night and the last

00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:29,440
people went away at 12 o clock in the

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,350
morning and then after that you can see

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:40,450
that the temperature goes down and up it

00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:43,630
is fun but the the whole electronics is

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:45,319
basically the same as the bottom but

00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:51,699
it's the lower bottom I

00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:55,759
have a thermometer every stay in the I

00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:59,420
enterprises years of the esp8266 but for

00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:05,029
grounds the thermometer Celtic trance I

00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:08,390
had a chart USB charger to give it power

00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:11,209
and didn't customizing says if you if

00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:17,869
you if you want to done it can get

00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:22,039
really cheap I still need to talk about

00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:24,529
the software but this also so Ben oh

00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:27,829
yeah so this one doesn't use difficulty

00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:31,249
I just installed installed it's the

00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:33,289
piece are on it and you can call it so

00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:35,329
home assisted concepts like regularly

00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:36,079
first my head once a minute but now I

00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:39,380
have it most

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:44,479
what's an hour and just it just gives

00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:46,719
you back the temperature as a floating

00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:50,150
point number

00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:54,759
yeah we talked about the train al are

00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:57,380
already when a fun story was that I gave

00:45:54,759 --> 00:46:00,440
like I was inattentive when I was

00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:04,130
basically talking for one hour to like

00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:07,579
100 people and it was in the morning and

00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:09,949
I was at home and then obviously our

00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:12,589
sister wanted me to go to the train so

00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:13,459
three times during the two times during

00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:16,910
that hour

00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:25,069
it's a Gina let's go to trace leave it

00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:26,989
come on and everybody so there are

00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:30,890
obviously different ways to trigger

00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:33,709
stuff for example I have here for for

00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:37,390
trigger sleeping I can do the butter or

00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:41,049
the UI but there's also something

00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:48,699
built-in if you're using Chrome

00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:57,849
you can use Google's Peaks to text to to

00:46:48,699 --> 00:47:04,749
trigger stuff ended here so it's already

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:08,409
quite late so what you it's built in

00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:13,419
that you can do like intentions and it

00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:15,789
tells again so basically the the intense

00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:20,319
camera can come from either speech like

00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:26,529
with a browser or other places so I just

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:30,189
to test it I like just three of them ten

00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:34,319
times I can ask it what time is it good

00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:39,219
night good morning basically and then it

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:44,529
it's either a critical services here

00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:45,999
exactly like like the UI but they can do

00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:52,059
everything you can do in the UI you can

00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:56,679
also program directly Yama file which I

00:47:52,059 --> 00:48:00,989
did here so like the exodus here for the

00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:07,949
services to go your own identity ID

00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:11,859
sleeping for example Palma system has

00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:16,239
like you can see the what that was

00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:18,549
yesterday 1048 components and a

00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:23,469
component this night for example google

00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:27,009
assistant or IKEA throw free activity so

00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:32,380
those are really different ones and it's

00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:35,979
really alive it is about 10 10 commits

00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:40,149
per day and I look at the last couple of

00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:42,890
weeks and it's about that it has over

00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:46,010
100 contributors

00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:48,970
I fetch it to the old license they have

00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:54,109
a forum where you can ask questions and

00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:58,450
accept obviously also I must to go to

00:48:54,109 --> 00:49:01,269
the chair because yet answers is fast

00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:06,109
there are a couple of helpers to us

00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:11,380
software I use is like duck DNS for for

00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:15,740
for having the dynamic IP connected to

00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:17,510
some domain that is let's approve to

00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:23,230
HTTPS because it doesn't personally

00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:27,279
think and because I have other other

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,670
cameras in other places I also use

00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,619
software called

00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:34,220
so minder if for most of the text in

00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:38,650
there well I only have like video

00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,650
straight from there my future plans are

00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:43,099
motion detector detector of the toilet

00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:47,089
because I don't have a window in the

00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:50,109
toilet and so I have just wanted to to

00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:53,660
switch on the light during the night I

00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:57,680
want to move to a look because so minor

00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:03,430
is so heavy that it needs more power and

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,430
I still won't only want one but device

00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:10,390
then I started to look into voice

00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:14,059
recognition without the cloud via sniffs

00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:16,220
but they only it's not open source and

00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:18,079
they only offer something for the

00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,180
Raspberry Pi so it seems to be very

00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,519
difficult to do it to do voice

00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:26,769
recognition on your device and now

00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:29,599
somewhere in Google service or something

00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:33,259
and then the one thing which is also

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:36,849
started prepared is unlocking the front

00:50:33,259 --> 00:50:39,489
door when it detects the night goes by I

00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:44,229
found

00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:47,690
projects where someone already did this

00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:50,229
already have all the parts basically and

00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:54,890
just need to implement it now

00:50:50,229 --> 00:51:06,410
and that's it if you have questions that

00:50:54,890 --> 00:51:09,680
we still have for bonanza yes I was

00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:13,690
thinking in this your train alarm have

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,650
you been thinking to kind of use some

00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:20,180
input from outside

00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:21,859
for example if trains are delayed or

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,440
cancelled or something that that

00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:28,069
information is what we do in Europe I

00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:32,989
wish I was thinking about it I check to

00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:36,109
the this like traffic markets has API

00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:39,410
and I looked at the API and I've found

00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:42,619
that they have this information somehow

00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:47,359
but it's difficult to to map it to my

00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:49,930
train be light so it in theory it should

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:53,259
work in practice it's very difficult

00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,259
okay thanks

00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:06,360
this light information is talking either

00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:08,430
to thinking about myself on tap is

00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:14,580
 like when I go on vacation I

00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:16,290
wanted to like like okay is that

00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:19,500
something

00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:25,230
yeah really easy if you if you create

00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:28,860
your automations like we have it here so

00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:33,410
for trigger basically you do the same

00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,410
what I did with the train our or with

00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:39,990
you trigger that time or random or

00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:44,370
something and then you just run the

00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:48,480
action therefore light switches on for

00:52:44,370 --> 00:53:00,570
that amount of time in this room that

00:52:48,480 --> 00:53:03,270
romance along yeah we very easy since

00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:05,130
you've looked into this how long do you

00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:08,570
think it will take until this

00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:13,530
infrastructure example the internet or

00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:16,020
connected switches and how long do you

00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:19,290
think this will take to coming to our

00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,600
home from normally builder so you don't

00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:29,700
have we don't have to hack our own house

00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:32,580
okay yeah I mean we do have those so if

00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:37,170
we look at this one in Germany

00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:40,820
the telephone company technical already

00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:44,610
has like us magetta smart house thingy

00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:50,690
but they try to to offer of this is

00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:55,230
basically giving in a nice package but

00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:59,280
it's so I'm not sure if we'll it will be

00:53:55,230 --> 00:54:00,829
that easy some of the low-hanging fruits

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,749
will be easy to do

00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:05,359
like in a mass-market mass-market thing

00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:08,269
a lot of thinking will be like so

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:11,660
individual that it will be difficult to

00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:14,779
because of depending on how flat looks

00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,700
like our house and stuff like this and

00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:19,999
what you want what your family wants

00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:24,619
it's so different that it's difficult to

00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:27,529
make it like a nice package to just do

00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:30,229
but they're over 10 just has a couple of

00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:33,709
like beginner packages with with a

00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:36,680
couple of switches and this set oriented

00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:40,940
like this one here so you can so this

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:43,940
can already be done fairly easy but most

00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:47,599
of the easy stuff is happening in the

00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,529
cloud basically if you're if you have

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,680
came with it

00:54:48,529 --> 00:55:05,469
that's your go for it but I don't want

00:54:51,680 --> 00:55:05,469
me or my data okay I think it's

00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:14,789
