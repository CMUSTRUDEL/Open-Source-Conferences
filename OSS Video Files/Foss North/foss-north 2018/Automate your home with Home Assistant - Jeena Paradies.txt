Description: 
	There are quite many closed solutions for home automation like Telekom's agenta SmartHome, Google Home, Apples HomePod, etc. What most of them have in common is that they don't like to play with the rest of the eco system.
Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform running on Python 3 with a humongous amount of integration into all sorts of systems. Track and control all devices at home and automate control. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi.
In this talk Jeena will explain how he automated his home, what hardware he used and what it took to integrate it with Home Assistant.
