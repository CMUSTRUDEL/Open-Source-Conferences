Title: Reviving Old Software - Helio Chissini de Castro

Description: 
	How bring KDE 1 to run on modern systems teached lessons on software backporting

Bring back to life an old software is easy nowadays, you spin some virtual machine with the older operational system and run it (or even compile it).

Bring it back to RUN in modern systems ? This is a completly different history.

Not talking on a full refactoring, or a port of the software, but bring s the real software with none to minor modifications.

There's plenty of reasons to do that, from historical software archeology to real requirements on closed software companies that need to at least access some proprietary format to export for a different used one.

What was done on KDE 1 ( and KDE 2 at the moment ) was an patient exercise in find the best solutions without properly destroy the code, and what is intended on here, is show steps tooke for the process, that can be easily applied to several other cases.

okay so hello

00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:24,400
well you here basically I'm telling a

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,949
kind of history of someone that's doing

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:33,399
crazy things and people don't understand

00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:36,250
why it's it's not an easy thing but at

00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,559
the same time actually eats a poop

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,989
obtained with the less important we love

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,840
people I've been doing just for not long

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:46,750
long time didn't do that until realize

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,690
it made this and my boy

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:52,329
is this show to you exactly what did you

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,800
actually can do and how you can do to

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,970
achieve this things the simple steps

00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:08,979
there but this kind of more dedicated

00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:13,869
work so to say this be long time Katie

00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:19,299
developer of a source other things music

00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:21,249
used to be a radio DJ from tango and for

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,469
some reason had passed for several

00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:25,689
industries I comes from Linux

00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:28,060
distributions in the big in the past to

00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:33,159
all we have before our Eureka Street and

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,150
Ohio industry and archaea audio industry

00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,890
again

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,750
and now I'm gonna have at the car

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,480
industry up industry I don't know why

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,640
but it's them and then oh it's next one

00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,810
maybe fight here but still easy to do

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,060
and basically I possible own most of all

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,060
kind of software that comes from UNIX

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,580
and if some windows and codes for

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,400
whatever you want and coding or whatever

00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,370
it's like basically a level engineer i

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,860
piec pieces and Bute to gather there's

00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,780
pieces that are also wrote it so

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,220
basically i don't know what they want

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,510
and how they work but they had to put

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:13,150
together and then why because this is

00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:16,450
the first question that I first say that

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,180
why they make 8192 one running on the

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:23,020
but the reason was behind the KT 20

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,450
years development because 20 years after

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,150
KD you need to show some interesting so

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,360
I started to make this to launch KD 1

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,550
again 20 years later in the modern

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,120
systems this machine that just to check

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,670
to check is a fedora 97 pretty much

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,760
latest machine running with circle and

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,030
other things and the reason why it's not

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,630
only the 20 years this pusher that are

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:53,470
made for you why we have museums so

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:57,700
please answer the questions anyone know

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,430
why we have investments yes this happily

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,450
to open high E string and then actually

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,489
what people doing missions it's not

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,489
sleep late they don't just put a story

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,650
there they have people that works on the

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,400
deceleration catalog there other things

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,700
we actually that this doesn't do that

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,310
software there's a several projects

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,989
around the world mostly started by

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,590
theater and console and video game

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,890
people to actually restore all the

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,780
things that come in from the

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,690
is not only compelling but trying to

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,030
make it work if you imagine for itself

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,730
Atari is a very easy example for that

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,640
because everyone likes in lobster 34 the

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,910
path of the easy but room remembers

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,120
hearing two pro graphics 16 who had this

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,520
console just all right but actually has

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,090
some great good games and that's stuck

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,060
in the past

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,130
nobody sells anymore nobody has the

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,440
original cartridge most people that

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,450
bought at the time was vote in there so

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,400
the people started to actually collect

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,770
the rooms many two emulators and try to

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,870
make possible everything available

00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,300
because this our history that's the

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,980
great things and we are not doing the

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,440
exactly the same thing with the open

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,830
source software we have an advantage at

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,950
this point that this right now we have

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,040
the source code which but people would

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,960
def coming out sources changing the pace

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,840
right now and then many people is

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,400
forgetting about the past okay we also

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:36,860
you know you have new versions of

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:39,560
everything yes but then before so reason

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,930
beyond that before start and it should

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,890
be easy when everyone was the first

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,720
answer came

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:50,380
I want to write all software what's the

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,960
person so that everyone do come on yes

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,960
that's a very pretty easy and means like

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,319
for example let's try to actually using

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,779
a very old

00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,789
who knows to learn a specific software

00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:06,189
it's easy right everyone can get a

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,020
parrot version or someone but the

00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,719
license is not valid in the orchestra

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,839
that actually is very hard so you need

00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:15,969
to do actually some illegal things this

00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,939
case if you have a source code to write

00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:20,979
there would be different but forget

00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:23,050
about fertilization would work and the

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,270
easy job everyone can do everyone

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,610
actually can do just need to know how to

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,740
restored it looks very easy for example

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,779
if you pick a dead end for twenty years

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,849
ago everyone knows how to start today

00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,740
just try to pick this people study links

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,389
they are trying to make stop them in so

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,879
still not easy people with different

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,499
conversation so that but the real

00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,749
question that's the cero

00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:45,930
can you imagine which other reasons that

00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:48,159
you want to revive boot softer and

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:55,289
talking about the commercial point of

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:59,289
view so basically imagine banks we have

00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:03,249
tons of times Bank applications that

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:05,469
actually doesn't have more time

00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:08,409
durations are still learning old systems

00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:10,419
and the systems are become important and

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,669
the doctors and other things were

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:16,059
created inside the market we need in

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,709
some way that least eSports or a new

00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:21,969
applications have the excess of a

00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:25,389
structural other things and really you

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:27,370
want to the man who is spend ages for

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,199
people rewrite the software how you can

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,089
guarantee that someone that's the

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,459
writing software that 50 years ago them

00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:38,080
nobody can guarantee that so we actually

00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:41,680
we kept the idea became this local put

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,789
the new machine and run either to at

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,669
least have the data in you can use this

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:50,379
data for any application or even make it

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,469
to work on the new machine with minimum

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,490
of work minimal costs and around the

00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:59,599
life of software because Baxter

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:02,150
anything or or for example that imagine

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,940
that the governments are using computers

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,229
for a long long long long long time

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,919
using several kind

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,940
it's a dose of occasions this is even

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,580
complications of this data structure

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,130
term death is not simple simply look at

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,560
the code imagine oh this is how the data

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,120
is there but you don't know how this off

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,699
their performance on top of the goal

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,979
even if you have two data so we need to

00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,080
reach no software to actually be ported

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,630
and running to actually see how the data

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,639
is there so this is actually several

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:36,970
valid reasons to actually use them of

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,680
course it's not a logical spy but then

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,509
this warehouse thought it was thinking

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,699
about why I'm doing these things not

00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,349
only their analytical part of KT 20

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,840
years this is just a result of takes

00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:51,020
that thing doing 3d scene long time it

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,569
started really to here I don't know if

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,210
you can see clearly that doesn't that

00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:58,970
figure the time you take this ugly for

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,389
the first two thousand two this is the

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:08,030
first ATM running on UNIX to demote yes

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:09,020
I was just out of university and I was

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,530
working in the IO

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:15,680
graphic interfaces for our company and

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:19,430
then I receive an advice for predictive

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,949
analytics company long time the same I

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,789
saw yours if he you were to actually

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:29,000
work in a project serve there as a tests

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:31,699
period to work there say they always

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,360
want to work at food Linux time but I

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:37,849
was young until the Box ms-dos I knew

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,750
about something in Linux and completely

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,089
naive what wearing into but I decided to

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:48,170
jump down and then when it's made this

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:50,600
word for the first word its 2001 the

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,570
first actually port of Limbs

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,980
why this made we actually have the

00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:01,070
original seed coat it has lost food for

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:03,769
XE long time running about and

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,329
most of the back says we have the

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,399
Machine through them the company purpose

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:09,790
in the ATMs we can provide the drivers

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:15,139
but a month exactly the same thing Reni

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:17,449
it's a sock in it so in my naive oh hey

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,110
I go after that and start to looking

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:20,360
around

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,759
I discovered that at that time cutis

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,319
were recipients gtk is admissible

00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:29,509
so everything was later x11 and this I

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:32,269
need to actually discover everything

00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:34,940
during the part of project it's like the

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:37,220
pilot was a crazy thing that's this is

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,850
possible just as money it's running at

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,180
you I take two years ago this after 12

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,639
years say both right and then they

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,889
change it for a newer modern interface

00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,230
but it's worth it so this was the first

00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:54,980
real ATM running from top to bottom in

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,199
examples of open source because the part

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,870
is connected what's easy the point that

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:02,480
this appliance is not so it's not full

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,639
circle to the sacrum is when you come

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,010
over another batter to make cc's connect

00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:11,089
any plane but this master doesn't want

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,089
its meaning about 17 years ago that just

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:16,390
a quickie story about them but the first

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:19,210
day that we are about to show off or

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,890
it's the first time that say how it's

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,760
working it's already working everything

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,470
I decided to put on that top with the

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,690
logo of connect it with the company

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,940
alien distance faucet on the other side

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,500
anything goes all the managers and the

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,080
president of the back to life like a

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,230
definite a nyan spider but they say oh

00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,330
but we need to take away the logo of the

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,080
company they never said anything about

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:55,420
the tanks

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:57,910
so in 12 years this actually fits with a

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,230
real one quality that so basically this

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,700
is the holiday so he directly started

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,550
the whole thing about working on

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,830
software pretty much is in this way but

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,440
they take up space at same point two

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:15,040
years later we have a copper by another

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,090
financial company that says they

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,310
completed I start a stock market

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:25,530
application they use it there it was

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:28,000
written on the visual age an IBM C++

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:31,800
library that seemed like the time with

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,120
MFC or these are what chance and

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,310
documentation was very very good

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,200
I was not in to leave the project of us

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,140
them in the group that's the trick guys

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,230
are doing and then there's ugly

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,390
the example of failures there what

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,750
Stephanie this is a Windows application

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:53,110
and then we have the visual age nothing

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,149
actually was if instead we have open

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:59,140
source in general we have the code word

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:02,019
then the application itself we have the

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,839
code of Israel H because it's a point we

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:07,000
haven't done the question is okay let's

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,730
start to work in there so people start

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,190
we decided to go around and say let's

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,920
work on this list compiled against

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,959
against against the prevented graphic

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,709
mappers and then someone tell or no is

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,130
too difficult

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:24,430
let's say it's a regular month names on

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,290
the idea of prototype and say no no it's

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:30,339
not working you've never been done that

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,959
let's let's go and try it mine and using

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,910
Y and running a Windows application

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,250
other what's the completely fail with

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,920
the doom of the project was that because

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,220
exactly what I was not ready we will not

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,000
have caught so many kind of the behavior

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,459
of wine is too huge to control there and

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,160
I will say about how I was supposed to

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:54,250
be done but this was like the problem

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,260
that the way that you decide try the

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:03,990
sightings during the project you don't

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:07,089
you not set up the project step less

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,220
after some years later we applied the

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,850
same and in technology but for current

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,170
projects weather was not yet the the

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,510
first assignment

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,910
they had a problem with current

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,080
environment who remembers in a canaanite

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,550
yeah so that nine of us basically long

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,890
and they have a problems with the

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,200
current interface with cute interface

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,510
because the poll of the set of memories

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,420
was too slow and we need to actually

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,820
almost doing performance cute analysis

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,320
so we need at some point to plan and

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,110
improvement Harvard to see what's

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,450
covered in there so but we need to test

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,730
a sample Pacifico there was not it's

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,550
what I could rewrite the code otherwise

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,080
the testicle famines so I because I

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,090
believe the same of ways and the gluon

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,100
things separated the code to just

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,960
compiled over them and just put it

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,490
exactly the libraries the different

00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,830
level of libraries that they need to

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,350
test other things so we meet at three

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,690
different releases of the same thing to

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,220
testing using the same code but

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,620
different driver is just adapting the

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,650
same way to so easily the same technique

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:15,640
kisses the violets work or the pages and

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,950
the lesson learned

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:23,080
this is I call it a poker stick night

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:28,300
because this is really kinda keeps us

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:32,560
like this is her your project needs time

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:35,890
to play before started and even if you

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,140
consider this type of project you needed

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,200
to do whatever you want you know that

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,110
moment that thing you need to fly on

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,940
YouTube and your your manager said what

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,920
are you doing you should do in the

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,990
project no no you need that Jenny give

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,770
you to time all the things but this is

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,710
meaning in the Google time why because

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:59,920
we start before the start this why I'm

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:03,070
saying this because you get to do all

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,630
the new things that first moves about

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:10,090
first you need to see what all softer do

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,770
then it can come to vector machines you

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:15,160
need to see how the software is solid

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,490
you see how is the software is is likely

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,430
behavior inside

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,500
system and you need to see what the

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,450
software actually do because most of the

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,339
time people that to do its job actually

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,279
don't know what does have to do we need

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,410
to learn saying yes this is the first

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,930
thing you've you learn new things and

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,390
you need to learn new things so we need

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:39,110
to get the old one before you get to the

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,899
new and understand what you're doing it

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,850
so basically if you don't know exactly

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,730
what do you do in there

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,270
you need time to learn you start the

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,649
project

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,480
okay that's doing the things that you

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:53,270
don't understand that you do it you fail

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,370
sorry that's all you take time or people

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,040
will try some money and then make the

00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,930
they stupid mistake off oh we need more

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,589
developers and then make everything

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:05,660
content also work so this you should

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,970
consider to have two projects

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,830
the first one is people call it

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,080
prototype whatever is not the prototype

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,510
is actually the time that you need to

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,980
learn and understand it's not even they

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,589
go to a training to understand things

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,810
actually is your time to do in that it

00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:23,029
not need to be everyone we do but just

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,570
one step actually touch to your home

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:30,079
the second thing nothing is sacred but

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,360
the code because this of this is you are

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,020
doing the poor thing

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:39,740
for this you're not doing the everything

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:43,279
so the beauty and pain a good system for

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,470
so it's my first room the build

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,560
assisting need to go it's to the O's

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:53,570
it's everyone knows that build systems

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,120
will be come in like all the things that

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,640
people say it's very difficult to write

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,890
it is very difficult to do except for

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:04,360
make that is the same thing that's in

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:07,179
fact as hell it's everything we can hold

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,270
whoo-hoo today's use the altitude

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:15,410
sometimes sometime you have Kansas City

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:19,069
to to see Alice and or for example let's

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:22,250
see okay let's go goofy I still use an

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:26,050
SVM for new projects right now or

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,329
altitudes for new projects this see

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,910
and the people you say that okay what

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,770
you using right now

00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:36,910
yeah they don't eat yes but but for a

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:39,690
big system yes but now they're talking

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,760
about people using start to use a basil

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,410
inside the companies that it's not

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,240
writing like people say is the nest

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,840
makes a big sheet is good for

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,910
integrators but it's not good for

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,030
developers you know I can say this

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:59,350
reason and this new build system come

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:02,500
from we know um etc first of all you

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,780
don't need to be the major expert in the

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,700
build system that you choose to use that

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,320
you need to understand a good system

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,390
that's it while you don't need to be a

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,850
major expand because this kind of

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,560
projects is one single shot it's not

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,440
getting the degrade you're not getting

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,530
the price so you need to do exactly what

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,050
he needs or in my case a specific folder

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,380
for the KDE cute I need to deal with

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,450
both make finest islands I need to do it

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:32,740
all the tools and they need to keep the

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:35,140
QA further the side of things so I knew

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,480
pretty well most of them because I used

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,150
to work the was easy in my parcel so

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,090
what I did is actually creates a very

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,310
hawkish scripts that actually parsing

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,410
all the things to generate the basics

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:50,830
evening that I needed and then I can do

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,410
it so 90% of my work registers automatic

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,420
and then I just tweak it the subway the

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,280
parts that I needed to understand but

00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,680
this is important thing there was two

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,770
steps the first one I compiled at the

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,840
second one that will make it useful

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,070
because then this where people stops

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,980
using these thing

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,840
ok close compiling is amazing too no it

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,100
was not done because now you can

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,200
understand that you compile and

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,950
everything go back and then do it

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:21,480
properly then you can see the visuals

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:24,940
then run affirm that we made any sense

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,230
it's the fact that this is very known to

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,070
open-source people

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:33,160
and you shoot actually avoid we always

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:35,559
want the next big thing we comfort all

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,200
nice ones using this is the next great

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:41,020
system with to let signal center for the

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,120
different no no we are not doing these

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,190
things it's okay for your new project

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,900
two things that we need something

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,530
actually stay forward to have some

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,380
knowledge because you meet at some point

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,360
some blocks that you need answers and to

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,160
talk every where if you get the very

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,500
very first new thing that could be

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,940
amazing it could be completely no you

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,309
don't have any proper answers right now

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,220
you don't have time to actually do a

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:10,590
proper application and then same time

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,590
asking to discover things no this is not

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,559
Paris roots with the past this is the

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,419
one of the important things you push the

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,700
results of the videos every single

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,620
beautiful time with Zack we want to

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,570
happen in the past so you know one on

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:30,790
one that's exactly in the beauty system

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,600
way that's okay this works before not

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,929
working right now

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,270
oh but this library file or this audio

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,559
file is is different if the system is

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:44,350
now looking in different places

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:47,799
that's it so you need so not being a

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,900
hero never this is another program with

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:54,460
open source developers I'd be dead

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,980
before and you have my four parts like

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,070
there are the police is not every

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,770
application

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,840
the better leverage if you think really

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,930
about the most basic dependence on the

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:11,450
Nexus is an Ipsy or TVC

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:13,220
so you're doing work software and why

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,150
are you saying that what is the first

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,280
thing that with a new developer or

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:23,810
common immediately started open source

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,120
developer - yes you are doing a software

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,340
that you're porting software what what

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:34,570
do they think about it is if you have

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,570
dependences what they can you do come on

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,710
yes exactly that's one of the things and

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:46,010
other things is like actually trying to

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,960
compute the old dependencies everything

00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,850
that's ok let's do everything then you

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:55,040
know do you know how to do that

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,730
it's like there's a big chest the

00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,300
physics is another domain so before

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,370
trying to do a crazy things in reviewed

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,460
thousands of software we need just one

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,590
software in his still one chart we're

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,410
not going to further things at the

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:16,310
moment we need just for specific reasons

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:19,370
so we not update any kind of dependency

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:24,770
we just update only if needed

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:27,320
if doesn't exist process and then rapid

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,600
is a choice this is actually the proper

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,140
solution for the project that television

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,870
even that time instead of doing

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,540
completely trying to go to wine of crazy

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,270
solutions like that we actually

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,220
rapid only this cause of the food trust

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,980
or anything just one fifth of age and

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,110
put in a library for example he was sick

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,790
us plus at that time was feasible using

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:56,390
cute so we do many exactly like these

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,710
are age cute class that wrapping isn't

00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,679
just

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:02,320
and people say well what's it's too much

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,120
no it's not because your application is

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:10,600
not calling all the 500 some chunks of

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,909
which it's calling 100 less than that we

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,669
don't need to do everything so the

00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:18,640
actually difficult work will be just

00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:21,580
actually wrapping the signals or how it

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,100
cost so you reduce your amount of god of

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,929
almost nothing compared that you don't

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,789
touch the code of version of code you

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,620
don't touch the library that is bigger

00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,990
but actually you have a wrapper endless

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,980
may be the proper things and this will

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,720
make it proper right so the five persons

00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,640
work at that project would probably need

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,529
two or three to make the things would

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,179
work well it's failure I also didn't

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:51,610
mean to that everything secret with the

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:54,100
codes so I'll find out how much things

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,580
we did the trial compiler software with

00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,500
modern things like GCC seven or cloud

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,500
and what is the first thing that happens

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:08,409
yeah this is what it should look like

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,419
the amount of things that compiler a

00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:13,149
detector in our one and other things

00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:15,880
that we didn't imagine it exists code so

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,200
basically this is starting to become

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,730
this movie because you need to

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:28,980
understand that this is warnings are

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:31,990
valid or does a reason to exist so this

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,149
is all the may be tempted to make your

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,669
compiler behave like all to know we

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:40,500
start from the very very top of what

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:43,809
compiler provided right now it's like

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,059
for example you go say to compile our

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,220
compiler C++ things am going to success

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,710
was 14 let the compiler knows it was

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,700
possible because it's it's supposed to

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:58,240
so long to actually perform to have all

00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:01,430
the basicness was 98 and to them and you

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,350
start to see the famous if the

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,090
co-holder that they can change they

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,820
regenerate and continue is there

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,790
something that actually listens for c++

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,710
90 then you start to slow down you calm

00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,550
your compiler to butas not to either

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,990
working so this is you need to actually

00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,390
currently that it compiles with what's

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:23,240
researches back to guarantee that you

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,820
decide security there will be a nice and

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,000
effects when you don't do that if a

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:33,580
voice of why did all the time try to fix

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,160
this everything behind so about a medium

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,990
setting that's the presentation everyone

00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:46,870
the say well there's a warning for my

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:46,870
software let's fix it right no no no

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:21,330
so let's come on

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:23,640
okay it was of course it was not fine we

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,820
need to fix a reverse tester the

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,480
emphasis of obvious things so care for

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,790
peace this death because of me on this

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,950
world and talking about care for repeats

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:37,080
in like pieces that do you looking for

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,550
and beats like it is talking about

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,620
softer that was made there for eight

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,780
beats sixty Peaks did it to be tender

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,750
competitively to six porcupine Analytics

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,320
property so this you know that something

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,810
says very nicely to happen when you're

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,870
actually sick the pie-o-my is every for

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,970
me with yeah go ahead and see how this

00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:02,610
justice works

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:04,080
why this why because unless you are very

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,810
strict event

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,080
Oh to some warning says that this eve is

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:13,590
not properly placed the dance of

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,450
declaration inside inside my evening of

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:19,080
that time is safe that does not to use

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:21,030
it and the compiler is not magic they

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,310
don't know is that if you use it as ugly

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,650
in the C++ ago the world of things so

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,230
you don't know this luckily to be in so

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:33,150
it was a warning keep that way unless

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:36,960
something everything all these things

00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:39,000
not work properly without after on the

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,400
best when you have the first thing I'll

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,440
show to you exactly when we're tired of

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:48,660
this behavior and then we don't yet so I

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:53,120
will try to show to you something let's

00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:58,250
actually make it try to duplicate

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,250
display to make it properly

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:23,200
so you know that the new machine and

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:25,120
then I will show to you is that we this

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,050
is a very fast population because for

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,960
example cubes

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,730
it's not that big I'll go to class

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:40,050
people say kids not me today not today

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:57,400
hours or something yeah that's so

00:28:40,050 --> 00:29:01,030
completely so it's some kind of cash but

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,070
I can see even a second unit show that's

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:07,720
what it's doing right now it's using a

00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:12,130
client yep and using pool cues so it's

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:16,450
basically this is exactly 15 years old

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:18,400
code with almost no changes it and the

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,030
season different change it so this is

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,310
going going going so much there so you

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:28,360
see that's a little steep I like you too

00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:32,290
yeah so it's okay it's compiling it's

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:34,360
working let's see I've compiled with

00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,020
aircraft so I don't need to care

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:50,090
actually you how to invert

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:52,760
ladies and this is the sweet thing this

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,770
is of course this is in C cash but it

00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,830
sticks another 15 minutes to compile

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:01,010
this one so we stopped at me it's seven

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:06,640
years old already so let's see April 2

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:09,110
examples and witches let's go to see

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,390
here we go I stand on having the key see

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,990
here but there's a minute and you go

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:19,700
this is q2 basically running of the on

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:22,280
this brand new fedora with GD so ok it's

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,720
fine and you say perfect I did it

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:29,390
it's working remember that I talked

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,780
about before so about so then you see

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:36,620
the tanks after with the testing things

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:39,680
let's see if you know what's happening

00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:43,960
one of our very no obligations from the

00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,960
queue to that time is called a designer

00:30:46,060 --> 00:31:05,960
graphic so you see something strange

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:08,830
ok like what minutes for you to discover

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,830
what's happening right now

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,400
it's remember is 15 years old

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:26,570
come on no wait wait no I'm not using

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:30,020
well this is 3x no we're not related go

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,710
to you it's not we're not even compiling

00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,640
the way that time this is one area of

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,410
your X is further application

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,630
you see that the widgets application

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,990
works perfectly why is this happening

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,990
right now

00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:51,570
yes it's an external force no no it's

00:31:48,240 --> 00:32:02,760
not it's the four minutes running ex

00:31:51,570 --> 00:32:10,770
work come on guess there's nothing like

00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:14,100
that I mean it's not that related it's

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:16,320
perfectly fine for the size of X of X

00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,170
everything is perfect and if you click

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,480
for example agility if I click on

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:26,040
something here again the application is

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:39,500
working properly but percent wrong it's

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:39,500
not that come on two seconds okay

00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:54,200
no yes you got it

00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,840
there's something that's very

00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,350
interesting

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,140
we don't have a RG devious walls on that

00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,300
time it does exist the video cards who

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,240
are pretty much posturing we are in a

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:12,120
very early stage so basically we don't

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,180
have transparency beat and the new

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,090
structure for this they actually don't

00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:20,520
recognize transplants to be do that so

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,920
what happens and then when we run like

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,540
this because ex people notice that and

00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,540
help research so

00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:42,390
it's basically we just say to keep the

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:46,210
net beef beat and using them and okay

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:49,059
then my question is should I put this

00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:51,100
something in the cute coat yes I could

00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:53,440
actually put it initializing the corner

00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,919
of the graphics there and fix there but

00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,130
no there are you broke exactly the

00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,350
library I don't know what result so be

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,570
it be perfect yes sisters application

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,309
will be running yes do I know the other

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,109
side effects to produce this inversion

00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,540
of coke no I don't know and I really

00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:14,379
don't want to know so unless it's really

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,280
necessary this is for proper solutions

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:19,570
that you looking for

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:23,169
so it's really functional I can just

00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:26,260
create a new dialogue let's go to the

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:41,230
wizard famous thing and then you can

00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:48,970
create whatever things we want you see

00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:51,760
something here yeah this is yes why is

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:55,810
that ii guess why is not showing their

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:59,109
property this is very simple question

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:04,150
and this is I talking about very very

00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:06,430
beginning of them of the talk it's just

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:08,830
I say comparing the current state of the

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,900
old widowed state this is just because

00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:14,109
the bitmaps are not in the proper place

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,580
we're looking for if you look at before

00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:17,560
and there is taller than the proper

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,520
vision running for the proper place you

00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,740
should be there but right now it's even

00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,890
consider that application actually are

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,140
not looking for that they assume anybody

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,180
forward that time that affected the

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,390
bitmap rosetta stone doesn't matter it

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:38,280
happens so it's then that that part will

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:42,090
come to GD P E and C look exactly the

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,640
situation if you not compare it with the

00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:48,210
original deployment just the point at

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,710
the stylus we don't need to what we'll

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:55,050
do on this open gdb start to run in

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,810
their best ways to look at the pointers

00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:01,110
there and like wasting the love of time

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:03,180
to do it the buggy when they tell you

00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,340
don't need it you just need to be nice

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,730
to them so this is exactly the same

00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:11,910
thing so pretty much just like what I

00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:15,510
wanted to say to you and this gold is on

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,250
github of course or the key depository

00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,080
then you of the second version and

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,910
actually did three times did you want

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,700
because I started put you and then a

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,470
predicted for Katie one and then I look

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,200
at that could be proven that they go to

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,700
Kate cute - and then the KDE two and

00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,170
then I do okay this is very nice

00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,380
approach and then they go back to keep

00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,570
while and remain again everything so

00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,470
it's not a single part it's like how to

00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:53,060
improve their even this process there

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:56,990
okay so my lessons right okay this is

00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,990
way too much crashing

00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:06,989
this is my pretty much thanks that we

00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:11,609
spend the time that's in serving greedy

00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:15,179
and I you can contact me with any of

00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:17,789
this emails or if you're really looking

00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:19,349
for a job just contacted me and talked

00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:21,059
about being Duffy we are looking for

00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:23,249
Linux and open source developers there

00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,859
and they're great everyone find what we

00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:30,929
are into if you want to work an awfully

00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:34,829
Germany that's a day so ok this is what

00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:40,259
I have to talk to you about and places

00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:43,189
questions you don't have in this machine

00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:45,929
because it's actually a machine over but

00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:49,890
technically yes I could you can actually

00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:52,709
use it there's a certain restrictions

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,929
because the final access archives this

00:37:52,709 --> 00:38:01,159
kind of different structures there but

00:37:54,929 --> 00:38:01,159
yes it works properly anyone else

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:10,160
as it was supposed to compare the speed

00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:12,019
at that time it takes like five to ten

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,480
seconds to win up an application we had

00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:17,240
to cut this five-six memory right now

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,130
it's compiling we climbed in this is the

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,869
compilation of sometimes miss Foster in

00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,049
some applications running nothing is

00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:27,980
impossible to confirm its it's blazing

00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:30,349
fast there's actually people asking me

00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:33,410
when they made it if they could make a

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:35,809
fool just row using their that you need

00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:41,240
to use this stable or even develop new

00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:43,190
software on top of them no people really

00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,880
craziness but it's really fast

00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:49,339
but in terms of a usability the members

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,140
we have nice rich just on how to use and

00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:53,960
why do you succeed

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:58,519
yeah but basically assisted wait going

00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:01,099
fast over that as a point of view it's

00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:04,519
was people really nice to see things

00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:06,680
like old K office running just something

00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:13,609
that people don't remember that KD is a

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:15,920
fool of this planting well this is the

00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:19,910
rewrite the whole story behind this long

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,829
just like it started it's everything in

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:25,990
that way to knock your house to to

00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:29,290
Microsoft and

00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:31,720
but it's basically better it's very

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:37,590
important point in open source timing

00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:41,440
when the serve was like splits of things

00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:45,340
when the Nokia falls it's affected a lot

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,680
of things and this is actually Caligula

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:51,160
itself but there wasn't many things that

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,140
service aiming for this and then which

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,480
changes for Microsoft in we lost

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,390
attracting its so the whole

00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,640
infrastructure for kiddies was taking a

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:05,050
very big heat because the difference of

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:13,150
control but the police now cutest gplv3

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:15,940
someone's but for us users it's really

00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:19,510
good for users yes I don't envy people

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,640
using this in terms of users yes is

00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:24,130
perfect then we can actually keep free

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,980
free environment for everything

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:29,560
it's we in the side of page here we have

00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,930
an official agreement under the jello

00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,630
let's call it kinda a free cute

00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:37,950
agreement if something happens with cute

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:42,609
company in general the code will become

00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:44,740
licensed GPL two or three automatically

00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:47,380
and we become we become an actually

00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,090
signers of the code so regarding each

00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,190
other please for the future that we keep

00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,260
to be a free doesn't matter what happens

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,170
it's nobody came in again and closed

00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:59,369
they could come and they keep the stem

00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:02,109
our freedom yes and that the only

00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:03,910
complexity with that is how we do it

00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:05,140
companies that the several companies it

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,420
gives perfect right now

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,450
dr. papaya because three is a lot of

00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,930
kids and so this until that this

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:15,850
guarantee some life of kids but we are

00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:21,660
talking about certain using a user space

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:21,660
and this is kind of great situation

00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:45,910
yes but you need to be really careful

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,670
about that because then that's a if you

00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:50,979
kind of go and you actually knows what

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:53,229
you do in the pond for baths it's my

00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:55,450
first same things the same way we're

00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:59,529
talking about huge companies like oil

00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,910
companies or even a lot of Ohio industry

00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:02,769
than to be using tools that for a long

00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,959
time in this case we're talking about

00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:08,920
safety related software you need to

00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:10,690
control there so it's yes but it's not a

00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,009
thing that you can do automatically it's

00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,709
I personally think that if you someone

00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:20,650
go on board of these things we have an a

00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:22,749
huge market for that but it's not an a

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,819
simple thing if it's like you need to

00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:27,940
worry it with more things than usual

00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:29,650
even more if you're taking about a user

00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,410
software that's the Z production right

00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,930
now you want to just change it so but

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,869
yes it's we will read it at some point

00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:40,119
to do it that and even people say your

00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:42,489
way are you do that no it's not because

00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:49,150
actually is not the thing that we simply

00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:51,699
put someone some AI to take it but this

00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,979
remember this is different from porting

00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:56,589
software like oh I have the software for

00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:58,599
Windows I want to make it version on a

00:42:56,589 --> 00:43:00,999
completely change like they you for

00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,690
examples today with video games that you

00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:08,049
have remade the code or from PlayStation

00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:12,470
2 PS work politics it's this it's a

00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:25,910
middle water between the football team

00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:28,490
oh is it before I think it's like in my

00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:31,430
Romanian first approach of this is about

00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:33,170
archeology relief I can I want to keep

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,700
the software running it's part of my

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:39,369
life it's not the vaquita you wanted

00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,840
that but in general this should be made

00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:45,099
just to guarantee that that you have the

00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:48,230
flow of data that we lost don't die on

00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,970
things that can recover anymore and you

00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,460
are given data therefore the new

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,090
applications can use it or pass by in

00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,530
this data for any amount of things but

00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,060
we don't have escaped victimization

00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,390
actually the world works in the

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:05,000
polarization today I think we've got the

00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:07,160
even further we can have several

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,810
hypervisors like we run in sticks that

00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,820
we don't know what that way anymore but

00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:14,540
so many on top it's not a single server

00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:18,200
but this this is basically saying that

00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:20,720
you can if you want that complete a

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,310
question if you go to this thing and

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,130
they often you want to revive the port

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:27,410
if you paid a lot of money for you but

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,500
you get you know that the risk of

00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,060
failure is very high because it's like

00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,609
gue you're jumping in the place that

00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,380
they actually you don't know yet you

00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,000
need to study I think that doesn't

00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,500
matter if you know it doesn't matter if

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,160
you are virtually using doesn't matter

00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:45,970
you just don't know they just started

00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,710
with some things that we can find like

00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,680
hundred two hundred persons in case of

00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,540
cute and piggies thousand persons and

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,670
you never look for code you need to look

00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,589
for the code everyone and then doing

00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:00,109
this it's not that simple

00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:02,320
so as long as you were courageous to do

00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:02,320
that

00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:27,930
what the spirit I agree with you

00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,660
for example actually flow wasn't on a

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:32,940
teacher University I wish exactly the

00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,530
problems of the argb for the students to

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,710
understand exactly what's the difference

00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:42,120
between where the dose policy beat or

00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:45,420
not in the video graphics so this is at

00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,940
some points and a more than that I will

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,280
use that with all defects to push the

00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,940
discover which defect is happening with

00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,610
new honor

00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,610
so the certain learning point is perfect

00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:15,000
in my case if I was like time I was

00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,520
working for myself get that right now I

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,040
probably want to do it sitting this way

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,070
are you ask them to pay for a fix of

00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:26,700
bread for to study into a timeline and

00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,800
says it's like they I will take a risk

00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,010
do you take a risk to for that they want

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,260
to pay two seasons each 500 knots then

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,090
it will be like this last time that I

00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,690
say after that we can't guarantee that

00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:41,550
they go go for it and this is talking

00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,260
who are you talking basically of course

00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,960
in the person's conference but this is

00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,910
Valentin even your closest offers that

00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,090
actually have access when the company

00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:54,180
hires you or doesn't matter because even

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:57,470
resistance like wonders come from MSB C

00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:00,150
or Borland they still have a way to

00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:03,120
distract them and you need to cue and

00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,490
understand them so that's basically that

00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,080
the tips are valid for everything

00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:10,410
the most important thing that we need

00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,710
you knew that you learn new things is

00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,870
the most fun things you need that you

00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:18,050
learn new things that are really old

00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:21,090
that do not use it anymore

00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:23,190
so this is so it's really think you

00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,470
spend your time of life to learn I think

00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,950
that's not use anymore so you really

00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:33,230
become and archaeologists are polishing

00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,230
things for the busy and restoring things

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,089
well so much it talk to the if you talk

00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:56,799
to like this is not about the gold but

00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:59,010
suppose the community was different

00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:59,010
times

00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,839
no it's so it's just evolved over to

00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:06,700
think some of it we it's like when we

00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:09,160
grow up we don't think it's differently

00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:12,490
things happen differently right now it's

00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:15,549
it's what is over for example for me was

00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:19,019
more fun at the time I was younger was

00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:22,569
doing new things Alice and was really

00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:25,089
interested on this kind of things today

00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:27,279
I'm looking for and working for a long

00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:30,430
time in history I know this elliptical

00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:32,740
things works and I understand that this

00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,049
looks like a task that they want to do

00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:38,260
with more a job personal job then

00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:40,240
actually define so and the whole

00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,720
ecosystem applesauce change the little

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,670
bits in with the way trying to get

00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,460
people to have been fine to doing gold

00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,289
anymore but the mind is oriented I agree

00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,269
creative startups I want to work in

00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:55,470
these things and then I want to get

00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:58,420
money or anything because we become the

00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:01,359
industry that give money for your future

00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:03,809
not anymore some new things it's

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:07,869
computer science become the medicine or

00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:10,660
lawyer for the future that's why so the

00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:13,750
people come with different - but we just

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,930
need to adapt for this it's same same

00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,789
thing was the goat and there's several

00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,529
smartest strategies at that time then

00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,119
even if you use it to taste like you

00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:23,799
know the doctor for this so it's a

00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:26,279
really good this really great was made

00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:29,680
it right at the time that right out no

00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:31,269
no I was tempted the Lords were they

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,430
doing there - you know what the key to

00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:35,369
is specific to look at this code

00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:38,220
I can change this and it was like

00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:42,130
craving to do that that's it no no no

00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,599
this doesn't happen there are some times

00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:48,430
in the future maybe some crazy people

00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:53,710
pick their and create an ke 2.5 and it

00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:55,569
will not be her okay I think before

00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:59,369
anyone talk to me later I'll be around

00:49:55,569 --> 00:49:59,369
it and tomorrow too so thanks

00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,559
