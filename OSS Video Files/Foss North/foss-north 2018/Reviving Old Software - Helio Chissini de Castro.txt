	How bring KDE 1 to run on modern systems teached lessons on software backporting

Bring back to life an old software is easy nowadays, you spin some virtual machine with the older operational system and run it (or even compile it).

Bring it back to RUN in modern systems ? This is a completly different history.

Not talking on a full refactoring, or a port of the software, but bring s the real software with none to minor modifications.

There's plenty of reasons to do that, from historical software archeology to real requirements on closed software companies that need to at least access some proprietary format to export for a different used one.

What was done on KDE 1 ( and KDE 2 at the moment ) was an patient exercise in find the best solutions without properly destroy the code, and what is intended on here, is show steps tooke for the process, that can be easily applied to several other cases.
