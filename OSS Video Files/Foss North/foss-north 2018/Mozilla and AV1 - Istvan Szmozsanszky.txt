Description: 
	The first thing that jumps to one's mind when someone mentions "pooling" in the context of media codecs is usually patents. Alliance of Open Media's first codec, AV1 breaks this stereotype by actually pooling *contributors*, as it consolidates the best parts, ideas and developer talent of Google's AV9/AV10, Cisco's Thor and Xiph's Daala codecs into a royalty-free and open source video codec that's not only supported by several other industry giants like Microsoft, Netflix and Apple, but is set to even beat the top-of-the-line (and patent-encumbered) HEVC codec in compression ratio. Mozilla Research has been a contributor to the development of Daala for years now and as AV1 shapes up to be the open and free codec the Internet always deserved (and one Mozilla has been fighting for) the 

Emerging Technologies division have further upped the stakes. As developing a cutting-edge codec requires cutting-edge technologies, Mozilla's ET division has been working on various, distributed browser-based tools to ease collaboration and hasten the solidification of such a diverse codebase.
In the talk I will introduce AV1, what industry dynamics contributed to its inception and how Mozilla has developed and employed several, in-browser tools, incorporating bleeding-edge technologies like Emscripten-compiled library modules in ASM.js and WebAssembly to help the contributors iterate and bugfix newer versions of the bitstream itself, as well as the encoder and decoder.
