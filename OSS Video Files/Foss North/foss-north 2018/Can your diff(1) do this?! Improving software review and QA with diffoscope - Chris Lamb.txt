Title: Can your diff(1) do this?! Improving software review and QA with diffoscope - Chris Lamb
Publication date: 2018-05-01
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	In an age increasingly concerned with reducing bugs as well as complying with free software licenses, it is vitally important to thoroughly review audit any changes to the software that powers our technology and infrastructure.

However, existing tools to perform comparisons between two versions of a software package are overly-blunt instruments, either providing too much output or none at all. Binaries such as firmware images or precompiled executables are especially problematic: a single change in the source is presented as a meaningless stream of changes, offering no insight into potentially critical bugs. And these are often precisely the files we care most aboutâ€¦!

Diffoscope is different. Developed as part of the Reproducible Builds effort, it gets to the bottom of what makes files truly different. It recursively unpacks archives of all kinds and transforms various formats into human-readable forms for display. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, etc. just as easily.
This talk explains the varied and practical usages of diffoscope and how this flexible "diff on steroids" is a long-overdue and fun tool for anyone writing or releasing software today.

	00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:22,020
anyway great sooo let's see so many

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,020
people here that's really early get back

00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:33,790
with you about seven to escape so so

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,000
quick thing about me on an open source

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:40,390
piece on the road for over ten years now

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,160
really fine first inhabited I fell into

00:00:40,390 --> 00:01:04,210
it's I'm the current Debbie and I'm on

00:00:48,160 --> 00:01:06,759
the board of the development that you

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,409
ought to play around for your computer

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,430
so quite a lot example here's an

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:13,320
operating system

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,969
I made that it's a live CD that just

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,409
plays the movie hackers on repeat it's

00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:20,170
pretty good for putting on a USB stick

00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:22,359
or these kiosk machines in what hotels

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,459
you're just leave it in there thanks

00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:30,759
they don't around - I'll take the USB

00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:33,249
stick someone wants a still I see can

00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,130
you get CP to give a progress bar logged

00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:39,729
on you get well yeah of course if you

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:43,529
use s trace yeah you pass the article

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,529
illustrates you can do something else

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:57,130
and the other one is sue don't we sell

00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:59,319
for a perfect any why why not XP so you

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,209
this you can maybe see the very yellow

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,279
thing there but the cool thing is he

00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,319
sent us reveal PostScript printer with a

00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:07,659
postscript interpreter in the printer

00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,610
itself it's the actual printer that does

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,959
this all the might not like the

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:17,590
rendering before we you know you've all

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:24,940
done this kind of office time

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:26,160
I pretend to be a musician at anyway

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,430
great too

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,470
dippers here why disco so let me give

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,599
you a bit of background detail so whilst

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,209
you get the source code for pretty much

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,470
every piece of software please offer

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,530
anyway you can download the source code

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,510
otherwise it all security laws and

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,599
things like that most people end up

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,180
installing violence they are do you

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,310
young install our captain's table and

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,900
think about that and so you can either

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,670
actually trusted these two things

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,739
correspond with each other if you look

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,269
at the source page with nginx this looks

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:03,819
pretty good 100% secure but but then you

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,290
just you know you just deploy and you're

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,230
using binaries that someone else's

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,239
compart can you trust they have some has

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,580
any sort of correspondence between the

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,519
two this is a problem because build

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,950
files can be compromised so you know a

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,560
compiled file servers running in the

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,440
cloud if you could upload and proceed

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,680
source code to it this nginx source code

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,390
for example but if the compiler can

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,519
compromise the servicing compromise

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,420
you've no idea you can't trust any of

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,150
the binary that cannot get around

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,920
you know it develops of machines in the

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,350
similar way can be hacked into I could

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,660
you know leave it around my hotel some

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,910
come in and you know training any pieces

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,889
by believes I then just keeping from us

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,069
like passively just a make and then just

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,380
revision they could welcome not sleeping

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:56,819
on that I mean imagine if I was

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:59,530
generating Windows by memories for a

00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,389
Bitcoin what maybe twenty worth your

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,459
wild firming it break into my hotel room

00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:07,420
or house and install something on a

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:10,090
laptop so what is it you can orbit it

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,190
every one moment but the binaries have

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,440
put out our Trojan at South steel

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,489
this kind of nonsense because they'll

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,230
just be black that so you lost your

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,510
computer and might be completely fine

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,830
someone can run your house and say yeah

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,490
you know these wires it make me feel a

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,130
bit console well that's nice you're a

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,850
really lovely happy wife children

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:40,520
anything to happen to them what's a

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:43,020
dwarf horseman can lean on you in ways

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:48,290
so this P just don't get on a target

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:51,450
foot so this isn't basically reason why

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,520
and this talks about reproducible

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,980
billows in the sense as well reducing

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,170
the threat level that so what we do then

00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,760
we go to builds is we basically - every

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,150
time you build piece of software you get

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,830
the identical results each time and then

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,580
multiple parties do the same thing you

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,570
do it I'll do it

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,010
bunch of other people do it and we'll

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,170
get together that atom to compare our

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,390
results and basically what this means of

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,730
the attacker even has to affect everyone

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,740
simultaneously breaking all of their

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,290
homes but with all the other neurons all

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,660
of their bill applies at the same time

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,700
or they they just don't or just mind

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,490
changes and things like that and so

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,090
basically everyone they must in fact it

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,590
helped everyone simultaneously and using

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,050
that you come to a consensus table

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,700
whether someone has been compromised or

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,530
not so if I get a different result to

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,460
you why is that was my computer

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,990
brokenness as you all's in durban it to

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,120
what he was enough people you can kind

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,500
of curse the poor mystic idea of what's

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,910
going on but this means that you may

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,330
notice on the previous slide identical

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,870
results if your bill is not you can't go

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,090
build an EPG swivel each time you you

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,879
can't make this departments consensus

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,520
model things of that and so like okay

00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,550
great let's do this in Debian Islamic

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,610
Debian reproducible so we we started out

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,620
with got to dance and Bill wanna then

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,500
just built it again you know basically

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,370
up enter it we buy it

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:31,740
I mean shot shall once alive just to see

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:34,830
whether video okay so the the different

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,530
okay so that everything bill is not to

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,150
be beautiful and we need the shafts to

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,530
be the same and then we can compare that

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:46,699
shop to Charlotte you make sure that you

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,289
make each other the bill on degenerate

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,169
okay great so while they develop so mean

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,969
basically thrown through the UNIX dip

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,430
tool that knows this tool you give it to

00:06:53,969 --> 00:07:00,229
files they tell anymore differences but

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:04,379
this isn't very useful in a binary file

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:05,479
so we hotel there's a difference here in

00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,159
the file

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,840
yeah what's going on here I mean we can

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:12,629
start to see some things or maybe should

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,129
be like sentence that okay yeah it's

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:19,050
probably been teased it - oh you know

00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:21,270
except that it but then you know what's

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,629
the actual difference my court what is

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,539
the difference in our build process

00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:29,940
what's actually really different because

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,159
while this is absolutely true it's

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,919
actually useless for a human being in

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,990
terms of being able to take this and go

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,669
all the way back to oh we just need to

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,589
fix this - stop it using some random

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:45,389
numbers we ran and dates and things like

00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:50,159
that so yeah okay great so let's just

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:51,680
let's go while a believer or even if we

00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:56,050
run it through

00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:00,099
xxd we can see that headers are changing

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,020
yeah that's poison check some yeah

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,789
additional ones get anymore and the

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,310
whole problem is compressed formats is

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,159
that a small change and compounding - a

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,389
big change in the buyer

00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,340
so okay let's get one level deeper

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,830
sources would wrap around it so we'll

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,229
take the wrappers off with a rx and we

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,330
end up with a control file

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,840
okay well that's been that's also got

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,479
some differences as well okay well grab

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,460
it deeper we'll unaccept the control

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:33,130
files and then look at the actual fight

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:35,709
stuff okay we're top okay there's

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,240
differences on there or are they don't

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:42,370
really notice it woman want our files oh

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,390
okay so the top of the phone contains a

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:51,399
 we'll use a big PM mixer okay with

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:53,920
a different default size okay great

00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,860
what's the difference that will undo

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,110
that or never do the same diff on P n

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,420
mixer okay

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,060
pity back to where we started with no

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,760
real idea what the real difference is

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,490
between these two things so basically we

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,649
should build it better dick because this

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:16,959
is just just you should see how it just

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:19,450
popped out let's go so we did we can be

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,820
called a diff escape and just do not be

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,649
through severe examples you give it two

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,920
files and it turns in difference between

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,440
them

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,180
it defaults to the uniform dip is what

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,149
you want to use the crazy this just like

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,279
really basic stuff by far called a total

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,050
a contains what food alpha being

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,430
interactive Obama you want different

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,149
difficult on them

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,130
you got no difference apart from colored

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:49,660
by default it's actually a progress bar

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:53,079
but the work here's the Pisco when you

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,400
pass it to taro exit okay great

00:09:53,079 --> 00:10:00,530
so you saw the scene asymmetry structure

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:03,980
here so HR has a fathers may contains a

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:07,210
father a beetletop contains the

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,830
will be with these domestic here and

00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,360
anything through broth so you really

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,140
start to see that it can be pump act

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,550
archive formats you can also you

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,060
compressed format so if those are

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,550
possible nuts happen to be geez it if

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,820
you run difficult on the apps for target

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:28,790
Lisette it will first on gzip them

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,250
showing any metadata about that G gzip

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,040
process for example of gzip happens to

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,220
encode the loss water pipeline Wow and

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,410
also usually it contains the original

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,980
file name that you can deep you can

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,100
press statements it's all there was a

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,560
reason why we're doing that yes my wife

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,750
but then inside inside thieves and Jesus

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,160
you know Avatar far and anything yeah

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,830
she's obviously that's actually

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,680
recursive as well so it started with

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,310
just recursively unpack all different

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,730
layers to get down to fathom cells

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,800
example here here's a AAF file which is

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,520
in a tar file which is in an xs

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,000
compressed tar file which is in a debt

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,980
which is no archive format itself it'll

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,470
just do this for me relative no actors

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,860
like that they're also supports more

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,790
advanced detection of disks between

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,070
files say for example file a contains

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,100
these lines recorder and far being

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:37,700
contains these order are in line it's

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,890
really hard to read yeah you wanted to

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,780
skip on that many will say the far is

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,450
basically the same but business-oriented

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,560
yes there are taxes for this disorder

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,900
yeah

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,640
which is kind of useful because it then

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,800
something is being sorted on

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,200
deterministically attack it's the same

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,450
but this in sort

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,990
this is really useful people take the

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,240
idea that that it's not sorted and going

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,220
well okay what what something doing to

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,649
change our oppressors to school these

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,810
lines and therefore the lines will then

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:14,120
be in order etc and in the building

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:17,899
reduce for the supports and HTML app

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,640
alert so and we'll see this is Suresh

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,560
he's showing off some more file formats

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,140
so you can give it to sequel like

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,680
databases and you'll actually generate

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,510
and then diff the sequel commands that

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,610
they use to generate that database very

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:36,380
useful so if you will build process

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,470
generates the sequel like database you

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,830
can say oh ok one two massive energy

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,450
bills these just make sure in each every

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,209
time you build it is the same number at

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:50,750
every second surgery this is nice HTML

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,430
which is very easy way of showing the

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:58,220
recursive structure of it when it gets

00:12:52,430 --> 00:13:05,120
to Devil's deep it supports one I will

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:07,430
perform favorably sorts angered 80k

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,920
images it's very useful for drawing

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,750
things on example f-droid reproducible

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,790
supports Berkeley DB databases that are

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,910
used back in the background extensively

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,160
in in operating system UNIX operating

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,990
systems was one documents

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,529
so that's actually a word government

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,970
with just a letter a and and that's one

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:34,040
would be in and it'll just dick them and

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:37,300
say yeah the hot ebooks doesn't support

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,430
the Kindle ones yet but could easily do

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,020
and so it's just think oh yeah these so

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,850
there's it's a date being in community

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,920
every time you build it so you can just

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,330
take that and be like great I've seen

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,580
tonight stories it's the same thing over

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,110
time now this evil generation would be

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:57,350
useful awesome

00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:00,839
oh no binaries get repositories yeah

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,779
specialists I've sewages this is really

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,370
useful so you can give it to ice images

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,070
and see whether they'll be reducible so

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:13,320
I use this to make the tails operating

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:17,700
system likes me etc reproducible useful

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:24,480
that even supports images soon difficult

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:27,480
to to show but it will generate a

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,480
between the two images and so you can

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,899
actually see whether things I mean to

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:37,709
you difference between the two images

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:40,380
Sports JSON the pretty princess so if

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,850
you give it I'll be JSON here with your

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,420
different order and you'll say oh

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,899
actually Indians which is often before

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,029
okay great

00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,700
so just got the call we have no ease

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:55,380
that you mean it's just

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:57,360
oh yeah all goalie files TCP dump

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,149
capture passes for a useful he knows you

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,110
you dumped one thing you start you do a

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,880
TCP dump you do another TCP dump it will

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,950
just say off is the actual meaningful

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,130
differences between the two parts to

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,450
PDFs again various for XML documents etc

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:17,010
etc etc and many many more

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,660
so how can you use this the QA I mean

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,510
you can use it for the PT supergirls or

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,610
maybe you know I just didn't know

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,740
typically increase of quality shorts

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,170
even if you just wanted to be normal

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,720
things so using it all the time to

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,750
basically just see the changes I want to

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,100
see it's a change that I expect so I

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:40,910
might go back to supply once work and

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,460
then I will make it two different angels

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,530
rebuild it again and run the disco now I

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,080
expect to see some changes between the

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,840
two things say for example if I change

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,980
the conditional if I remove something if

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,680
I've done something else I basically

00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,810
just want to see that's being reflected

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,580
in the dick between the previous and the

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,710
new version kind of like how you might

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,500
be tested the development when you write

00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,060
the test first and see little flavors it

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,980
should do it it doesn't fail there's

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,770
something interesting that as a parallel

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,140
to that if you made a change the piece

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:18,320
of software and run if it's code and

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,750
there were no changes whatsoever at

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,120
least no be legal changes whatsoever you

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,280
can stop it in firewall okay there's

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,530
something wrong with something it would

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,120
actually be a cause for concern so just

00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,790
being able to see in a meaningful way

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,670
the differences in really important and

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:38,900
often this is possible with a normal dip

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:41,480
through but if the bill is not 107

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,740
irreducible as other round things in it

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,620
would just be completely hidden in the

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,260
noise but we did the scope you can say

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:52,730
oh look we might change this just this

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:54,610
changes brilliant right see no changes

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,980
in which was not before this is I mean

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,960
the previous I know I've just seen the

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,710
changes you expect it's extremely useful

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:06,320
when you making save securities so in

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,760
those cases you want to make as minimal

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,560
chance as possible you're gonna push

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,870
them out to stable machines that are

00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,180
running stable software you're breaking

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,670
he wants both so this is a real example

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:21,560
I was actually patching all this is now

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:26,330
but they need it's just this in small

00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,169
change in the in this Java code and so I

00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,289
remember that Randy

00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:33,480
before and after and I could look right

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:36,179
in the Java bytecode and so we see that

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,109
the that constant 20 had been changed to

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,570
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:40,830
they were contra both changes but that

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,070
one was definitely in there

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,809
it's a very popular but if I ship this

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,029
out to a whole bunch of systems to

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,419
basically every single Debian system

00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:53,850
then it will break in random other ways

00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,330
which is which is just terrible and just

00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:01,019
yeah it's meant to be stable for example

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:04,109
that's really useful to T releases so

00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:08,309
this is when people yeah

00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:11,429
they mean their names they develop a new

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,559
version of the router firmware don't

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:19,080
install it because if they almost got

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:21,809
security you've absolutely no idea and

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,389
if you ran an IU diff between it between

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,159
the old and new versions you just get up

00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:29,549
our garbage but you can throw this in

00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:35,220
too difficult in you know unpack the and

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:37,529
the outs of cpio are limited and it's

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,389
like that and say the real meaning

00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:41,389
difference it's basically what attached

00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:48,869
so to get stuck in bigger scope the

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,759
previously easy thing to do is we're

00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:54,299
going to try not to do the scope talk

00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:57,659
and this is basically a web interface

00:18:54,299 --> 00:19:01,320
and you just upload two files one two

00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:03,419
and then give all them run the scope on

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,059
remote server in a sandbox environment

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,300
and give you the difference in video in

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:12,410
the nice HTML and also

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:15,200
the tax for well juice you roughly

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:19,100
similar file new system a few little

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,250
subsets we we're getting involved the

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,170
bonus video is because deeper scope has

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,570
a larger more dependencies to support

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,130
all the file formats and if you use the

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,550
web-based one which has all the file

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:38,240
formats installed you can just basically

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:39,470
get all the comparison you can also do

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,260
this from the command I'm using the

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:48,160
tried a scope tool which is available by

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:50,540
pip or apt installer and now basically

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,050
do the unload for you but from the

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,990
command line just barely and the current

00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:59,600
say to disco here's the commits every

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,690
time in every obviously the adult here

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,060
or two resulting on work et cetera and

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:09,050
it's under active development all the

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,520
time it's that's mainly because it's

00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,940
being used in the deadly of the apt saw

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,920
build order so for every package and

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,980
Debian we build them multiple

00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,370
architectures in a sort of torture chest

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,990
torture torture test to try and read out

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,400
any producible

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:30,530
[Music]

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:34,600
useful packages so this Apple here is a

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:38,480
build off and they called nose and it's

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,970
basically saying that there's looks like

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,670
some ordering here so that's on the left

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,190
field here it's coming out as enable a

00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:49,160
buffer and here it's a spot but here to

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,710
stop and and able to basically this we

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,330
knows build process that's not sorting

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:58,480
arguments from general

00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:09,820
in this manual page easy fix so yeah

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:12,590
that positions so this is a graph of

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,380
comparing two net BS be really stumbled

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,990
over time each one of these is a

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,700
particular release of disco so we did

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,070
some optimizations here they were

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,190
Russian here some more relations here

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:29,600
and then even more of its here so we

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,790
compared to I mean that's yeah a long 20

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:37,640
minutes down to something like 35

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:38,900
seconds there's some useful music and we

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,250
ought to incorporate some parallel

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,800
processing there being multiple previous

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,310
attempts some of them in themselves in

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,920
parallel just one Kumari boo got some

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,650
work on that now and reach students and

00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,540
hopefully will parallel processing which

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:58,520
mean really really useful and speed up

00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:01,190
that phony faculty so yeah if you like

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,500
the idea just so if you did this overall

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,810
you download it towards your

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,160
distribution and things like that so

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,160
yeah thanks very much for your attention

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:20,630
[Applause]

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:34,760
I this might be a general question but

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:39,230
comparing to Isis

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:48,650
that'd be analysis time we expect the

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:51,260
question it was starting to take well

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,350
tables for example I don't Danny not say

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,590
to prefer tells I so you know 800 Meg

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,020
okay then we after those optimizations

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:04,070
with something like twenty minutes

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:06,710
either to naphtha involved particularly

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:10,160
because and isolate contains to leave a

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:17,720
light image the things are binary health

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:20,480
wineries so it's kind of that works

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,330
corner a sport but 20 minutes for 800

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Nick but it already depend on the falls

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,480
on the inside if that's a nice image off

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:48,760
text it's an advanced any more questions

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,420
I have a slightly different problem I my

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,900
team some people see us okay no yeah

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,540
these kind of exercise I've always felt

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,450
it with you this qualitative

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,190
parenting's being able to show quality

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,680
companies by the recent environment

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,570
extremely important they have all had to

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,950
personally my teakettle I mean they

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,200
don't care they're ready to design

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,690
environment from anywhere so basically I

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,790
asked you all what makes you probably

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,490
convince someone that this is what you

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,530
should do sorry I didn't catch the last

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,390
step how would you convince someone how

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,280
will you carry the sacrament that this

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,920
actually will run into your development

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:37,470
and what you actually output is relative

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:41,020
so funny to put here that's Necker okay

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,400
so basically I have a surge in my team

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,850
some people complain that this is

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,160
useless

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,720
they basically say not interested in

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,310
comparing vibrance do you think it says

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,680
no but you are ready to take anything

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,900
from anywhere and I've always considered

00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,520
this to be a bad practice but this I

00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,650
have many people against me I'm starting

00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,990
to think maybe they're right so how

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,600
would you describe us the school abandon

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,160
how would you convince someone that they

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,840
are really one thing when it comes to

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,830
comparing values alongside you must want

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,140
to sell why would you want to basic kind

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:17,950
of stable build useful build is a bit

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:20,020
yeah so even in a person this isn't a

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:25,000
commercial proprietary environment

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:28,330
oh yeah it basically be me what's you

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,680
hovering that you to evolve baby you can

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,990
start to use some of these Quality

00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,430
Assurance things like you release an

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,720
update and you can actually just see

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:39,910
that there's no differences between you

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,290
two you can also do these by ways of

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,390
these binders from from elsewhere and

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:49,150
these artifacts or generating yourself

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:51,190
me you can also start to the other thing

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,520
is that when you reduce your bill you

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,120
can it's not somehow spots up security

00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,520
issued as well as where build processes

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,560
would every time you would build them it

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,960
would generate a new secret key or

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,440
something like that but then it would

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,639
include

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,490
see Turkey in the binary that was being

00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:14,080
distributed and in the tech in the

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,990
actual process of testing for

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,450
reproducibility it will show thee it was

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,669
generating into kinky each time which is

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,879
a very secure and sharing the same key

00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:27,690
example to is lots of like side benefits

00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,690
that meaning before

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:43,460
you support a lot of I promise but you

00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:46,190
didn't say so much about for comparison

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,950
how to attend fights for sure how much

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,860
information you get more for to

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,759
emphasize a line there as I promised I

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:58,370
see that it will them the elf it will

00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:03,080
basically run a very full object up on

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:04,850
the file so it will it show you what the

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,499
tech sections example so if you have

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,899
like constants in your heart error

00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:11,240
string constants it will show that it's

00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:12,950
between that that's usually or reproduce

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,279
or girls want to be that's generally the

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:21,019
difference the preprocessor might be

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:23,179
referring it some times that it will

00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,279
show differences in op codes and things

00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,179
like that so sometimes you can if you

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,490
just make a single change in a file in

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:35,149
in the source file example there

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:37,789
changing a jump sorry anything we do not

00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:39,860
if something's you can just see that one

00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,919
byte has changed in the eventful binary

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,480
because it's neutered job if you call it

00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,340
your job if not he put that kind of

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,220
thing sometimes see that compilers are

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,659
bidding your worst enemy here in that

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,249
they might do that and then they realize

00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:57,619
because of that they can do some other

00:27:55,249 --> 00:28:00,769
crazy improvisation than you know all

00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:02,240
bets are off there anything to get to

00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:03,740
reorder than all your offsets are

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,200
officers things like that so you get

00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:13,009
this cascading waterfall of changes some

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,950
kinky compilation of things of Diaries

00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:18,289
could be a the next step if example if

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,009
it could actually work out that actually

00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:22,700
the differences is just this integration

00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:26,600
that can be possible

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:30,169
I'm not sure but yeah most the time it

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:45,669
hits the meaning

00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:48,169
can be found interesting object so

00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:51,710
extensible you say this is if I want to

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:54,230
write my own dick to to animal disk and

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:59,450
alerts or do I have to change the source

00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:03,289
code there is an a external pocket or a

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,119
textured moment but that would not be

00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:09,379
too difficult an atom in the crystal so

00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:12,730
it is really a cabal say you just don't

00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:16,899
you just like just for your own person

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,899
thinking that that's going to easiest

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:23,389
yeah it's a pretty easy I mean in the

00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:25,730
simplest case if you have a tool but

00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:27,830
will you give it a file and you'll get

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,499
the text sort of equivalent to that part

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:34,669
then you can add support for file

00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:38,929
formats in five minutes if you requires

00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:54,350
more processing okay yeah it is quite

00:29:38,929 --> 00:30:06,259
straightforward form I will text is

00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:09,409
genuine let's talk okay yeah thank you

00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:13,909
thank you for a talk

00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:15,769
how can you incorporate is to with a big

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:19,700
infrastructure for a project like that

00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:20,610
Ian for a short that thickness build

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,280
service hasn't

00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,100
compromised so you wouldn't necessarily

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,750
use dinner scope for doing that you let

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,059
me use the scope before once you

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,080
identified that to build a difference to

00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,290
work out why

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,600
so from reproducible girl font of you

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:40,020
it's reproducible if it's bit for this

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,000
identical between the two so if you

00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,400
wouldn't use human abilities shall want

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,830
something you do see CLP and are the

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:51,660
files literally like for a commendable

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:54,840
and so you wouldn't use difficult at all

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,480
if you want if you wanted to have an

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,760
infrastructure that would check whether

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,710
your IRA is the same that you build

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,419
yourself versus Debian you'll just build

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,130
it yourself and just compare the parts

00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:22,620
you don't need to use different scope

00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:34,799
because that's just everyone this is no

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:45,299
company so do any of the GUI give tools

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:52,650
on the different scopes support there to

00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:57,350
be things so in the end you know yeah

00:31:52,650 --> 00:32:10,380
GUI option yeah and it's it's pretty

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:11,970
it's conversed when these cases so we

00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,919
need something to see we feel like meld

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:20,610
with the dots and the peaches object the

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:22,710
scope rather than the scope itself plus

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:32,940
no it's also used for emerging as well

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:34,590
as verges the the following question

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,419
might sound a bit involved and

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,820
theoretical but have you considered

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:42,480
about the security implications of

00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,910
supporting so many formats so artists

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,250
and work week now to sandboxed action

00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:50,520
libraries and utilities that you use to

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:54,679
parse this well this multitude of

00:32:50,520 --> 00:33:00,980
formats what basically never we trust me

00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:04,280
it will just to work there has been

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,720
having work done in this area in that

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,870
example I think we have a cynic

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,210
attacking those in some of our formats

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,180
where you know

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:18,180
sibling doctor for dr. forward and it

00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:22,410
could put up a write your enemies 1cv

00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:27,090
against it so yeah we have done some

00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:30,830
stock in that area and basically we

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:33,510
can't really do that much about the

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:38,490
example we can't review that much about

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:40,680
the be extracting utilities the things

00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,190
I've actually a figure to the loose if

00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,920
they want ever your fault system yeah

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:49,740
yeah yeah go back path we should go

00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,930
sandboxing that would be a everywhere

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:59,000
interesting the trial escaping and

00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:59,000
obviously snack boxes so yeah mister

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,290
gregg well answer much good to see you

00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:14,380
