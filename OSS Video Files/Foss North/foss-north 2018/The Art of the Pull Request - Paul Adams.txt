Title: The Art of the Pull Request - Paul Adams

Description: 
	Take a moment to ask yourself, "what are Pull Requests for?"

Typically PRs are used as a means to communicate that some body of work has been done and is ready to be merged. But is this an optimal use of PRs? If we submit a PR after the work has been completed, have we missed a golden opportunity to collaborate?

PRs should be treated like the basic unit of collaboration within GitHub-based projects. By using PRs as communication medium and not simply as a review mechanism, we can create opportunities to communicate better within our projects, enhance the on-boarding of new contributors and help catch potential problems early.

In this short talk, I show off the good, the bad and the ugly of PRs and provide a template for best practice which encourages communication and collaboration within your community.
