Title: Avoiding the Petard: Triage at Scale in Firefox Quantum - Emma Humphries
Publication date: 2018-04-30
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	The bug that could had sabotaged a year of work on Firefox didn't slip into production because of the efforts of engineers, program managers, and management to triage bugs. But how do you triage 9,000 bugs over the course of a three month release cycle and not burn out? How do you measure hotspots? And how do you make it sustainable? The Firefox team's bugmaster, Emma Humphries, reports on what one of the largest and longest-lived open source projects learned while building this milestone version of the beloved web browser.

---

Emma Humphries believes in making safer spaces for underrepresented groups in tech, the healing power of Sleater-Kinney's "Dig Me Out," coffee, and the Open Web. For the Mozilla project she helps people to file better bugs earlier in the release cycle, and helps engineers make decisions on those bugs faster. She started working on the Web when she asked the Tiptree Award's Motherboard if she could make a website for them. She still has the original site on a 3.5" disk.

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:31,050
say that this is a talk about getting

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:34,660
away with it it being on this case

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,110
should be a larger vision to a large

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,960
piece of open-source software without an

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:48,429
embarrassing there Russian or a book

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:52,989
that required attached be issued my name

00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:54,579
is Emma Humphries I buckmaster that was

00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,409
a corporation which is a fancy way of

00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,739
saying that I am an engineering program

00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:01,929
manager I'm a triage girl

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,239
on Twitter you're welcome to follow me I

00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:07,720
talked about triage open source file

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,300
also kvetch about other things outside

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,670
of Firefox and working on the open web

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,760
and the huge banner coffee

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,860
why is a huge beyond of title computers

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,010
I've been spending too many hours

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,320
playing with a BBC micro bed lately and

00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,010
yesterday enjoyed the workshop we were

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:33,670
working with another microcontroller in

00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:37,300
epoch and my electric bicycle also huge

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,670
Hawkins Nia and living in the in North

00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,020
America if you're a hockey fan process

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,860
is the most glorious time of here

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:48,430
because it is the NHL players by sharks

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,410
being not a fan of the Oilers or New

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:58,150
Jersey but this is just right outside my

00:01:50,410 --> 00:02:01,230
hotel so when I proposed to talk I was

00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,080
going to call her a Donna Tartt

00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:07,019
yeah the truck being foisted by one son

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,959
it's hard

00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:13,480
chemistry Shakespeare as she might never

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,909
remember Hamlet he let me know gran a

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,090
man on the middle attack was uncle

00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:23,660
Claudius is over Claudius had sent

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,660
with Guildenstern and Rosencrantz to the

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,300
king of England to carry a note the note

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:34,520
said kill the bearer of this messenger

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:37,610
message camera being Clarke opens the

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,120
mouth envelope because first he was not

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,530
using get crept up and changed his

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,650
message the same kill the person

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,780
accompanying the messenger and then Tom

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,120
Stoppard a few hundred years later come

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,630
up with a plan about poor guilt

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the guitar

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,640
itself is a seat by eleven it's an

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:04,070
explosive that you can see is rather

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,170
dangerous that lit by the few salir this

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,750
also leads to that hurts out their Saint

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,760
Barbara who was the patron saint of

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,560
people who work with explosives and I

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,410
think people who work with software

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,870
do not let me explode because the Vitara

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,200
is as good as blowing blowing up the

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,390
engineers working with it as it was

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:32,450
blowing open Singh blowing up openings

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:37,940
and fortifications Vitara unfortunately

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,560
is drawing a lot from FARC and I decided

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:47,150
I really want to do a presentation

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:51,110
around infarct joke I remember that my

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:55,070
favorite genre movies the caper the

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:59,060
capers cool the capers like Ocean's

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,400
eleven and heat and heist it's about a

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,320
crew getting together to do a job it's

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,770
not like the Avengers were it's about

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:14,810
how the crude forms it's everybody knows

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:17,359
their bit what's there you built your

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,900
team you know the guy who punches people

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,590
that hacker the grifter or this social

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,850
engineer

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:28,570
era the thief you also get the driver in

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,570
a lot of these movies

00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:37,599
and it's a genre that crosses Chandra's

00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:39,399
there is a king after we became out a

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,909
couple of years ago that essentially is

00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:45,429
King Arthur as a keeper Li ke Arthur

00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:48,939
grows up on the streets of londinium's

00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:50,739
and he forms a crew to go back and win

00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:55,300
the crown back there's the great Muppet

00:04:50,739 --> 00:05:02,559
Caper there's even a caper movie that

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:04,839
has mr. Spock and Major Nelson in it it

00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:07,360
was a made-for-tv movie in the 1970s

00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,789
even had this guy means Henry Fonda

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:17,769
thinking like did a movie a few years

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:21,659
ago so there's three things or conflicts

00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:24,309
in care or movies that you have to be

00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:28,419
that that have that are that's all the

00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:30,069
questions the complex one is are they

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:31,869
going to plot the caper are they going

00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:36,599
to break into the vault will they steal

00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:40,479
the shipment will they break the codes

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:44,459
will they get caught because you can be

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,929
the best you know team ever and

00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:51,159
sometimes you get caught and sometimes

00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:52,899
you pay the price or even worse yet if

00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,909
you're putting on Tina the question

00:05:52,899 --> 00:06:01,089
wanting ask is are y'all gonna kill each

00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:02,740
other on the end of this spoiler if you

00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:08,289
haven't seen that movie yes they didn't

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:11,969
kill each other so the stone here's mark

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:13,569
Nadeau he's our EP barkbox yeah Mozilla

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:16,539
that's his turn

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,249
I thought so I didn't think I needed to

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:21,039
ask him permission to do that he writes

00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:26,709
mountain bikes down mountains outside of

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:30,610
Vancouver and even the fornicator died a

00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:35,889
year ago or over a year ago he said you

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:38,949
know what chrome got all our market

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,090
share as we used to have all that market

00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:46,210
share and all that trust

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,430
on the open well and it's high time that

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,290
we come back and we take back that

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:56,350
market share so the plan was this thing

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,420
called Firefox Quon you know internally

00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,920
everything we've been Starbucks 57 but

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:06,460
of course we have to have a cool name

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,900
so public ferox quant now get there we

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,430
have to discern things we're going to

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,950
have to change the thousands of files

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,350
we're gonna have to look like thousands

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,650
of lines of code actually millions of

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:22,300
lines of code code in order to pull this

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:24,570
off and not get caught and not kill each

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,570
other

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:34,060
this is he able to look out before you

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,470
know if you're bill the ocean promotions

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,750
a lot and yet they look out for eating

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,870
or Sienese to have a casino security I

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,110
just want a clock and you start Andy

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:48,700
Garcia here and I love this suit look at

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:52,360
this suit suit his he's wearing a

00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,570
waistcoat that looks I'm curious you

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,490
know

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,960
look at that time I mean this is a

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,980
badass suit you work out who

00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,980
specifically head of IT

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:09,190
in our case it's a balk you know luckily

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,500
no sillas Mexico bucks on those pants

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,260
Scott does you no justice I got well

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,160
maybe not as Wallace into Garcia and

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,360
it's not wearing the full suit but

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,210
that's something it's going to catch us

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:27,160
it is not the cops not casino security

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:32,200
but a thug so you need another member on

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:35,710
your team full lookout and that's where

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,560
I ended up in this project is I'm end up

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,150
as the lookout trying to figure out okay

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,520
how

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,230
find the bug that's gonna kill us how I

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,470
got to make sure that the caption it and

00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:51,810
fix it so that we don't have a

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:53,370
regression or horrible but then there's

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:59,730
this other guy I think he was on a TV

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:02,550
channel skinny idea the stakes is when

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,880
we're working on Firefox we were getting

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,520
during the period that were working on

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:14,700
the final release cycle for our box

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,740
quantum or Firefox 57 we're doing 140 70

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,600
bucks a day

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,180
fifteen thousand bucks total during this

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,830
release cycle it says a lot of room they

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,270
cover a lot of butts that look at how

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,800
you're gonna do this here's some numbers

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,290
and this is the only graph I'm going to

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,930
throw at you just to give you an idea or

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,380
XY this top line is the number of bugs

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,660
that were waiting a triage decision over

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,380
the release cycle and you can see that

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,880
we push that number down it goes back up

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,310
towards the end over here and push this

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,310
be on the March line are the number of

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,850
bugs that we do upload so on you might

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,470
know that fart box looks on three group

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,320
of three different release trains we

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,780
have our nightly that's top trunk we

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,370
have our bina and then we have our

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,800
release so if you have a bug or excuse

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,010
me if you have a patch that lands in our

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,410
nightly in our you know in Toronto and

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,990
you dislike later that hey you know

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,340
really should have this bug not skip the

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,810
bait it's not gonna go out there really

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:24,150
suck we call this a plus we have less

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:28,560
than 500 of us for a major release which

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:30,780
is pretty good over here is P ones

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
affecting our main effect that's another

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,880
measure that we are using

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,530
I'm not gonna say that much more dot but

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,980
to get back to this problem is they need

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:46,530
a lot of lookouts I can't do it alone so

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,270
what we did is that we divided up inside

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,000
the fire-crotch project

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,360
responsibility for triage into a number

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,040
of triage leads these triage leads

00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,330
covered but in a particular component or

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,430
code are group of components their

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,690
responsibility was turkey bucks they

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,880
didn't have to look at these bugs on

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,470
their own and can delegate they can hold

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,640
meetings but these are the people that

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,320
were saying okay

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,779
we expect you to be looking at new

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:22,500
Buccaneer components and raising your

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:24,690
hand when you see the showstopper the

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,260
other things that we built on top of

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,990
that is to use dashboards now first we

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:35,730
used to being a report in Bugzilla to do

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:39,050
a dashboard the native reporting in

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,370
Bugzilla has some issues but it did

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,640
create one thing it was a place where

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,070
every morning or every week however

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,959
periodic you did it you can go and say

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,520
hey what are the bucks I need to look at

00:11:50,959 --> 00:12:00,060
every other person wins that poverty

00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:06,360
abide by a year the second thing we have

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:14,880
was wow that's a glitch leadership we

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:19,920
got there sure from the top so mail to

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,680
the engineering directors all knew that

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,440
we had to find the bug that would stop

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,079
us Sarah

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,700
it wasn't me as a program manager saying

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,910
I need you to look at these bugs

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,160
it was engineering directors talking to

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:40,550
engineers saying I need you to look for

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:44,820
this box that's that's a critical piece

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:47,040
and then finally consistency when I

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,370
first started a Mozilla two and a half

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,160
years ago while being beyond is that

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,690
everyone was using for the most part

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,280
bugs allowed to manage

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:05,010
the bugs but there was almost a travel

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,770
level knowledge in full of ways on

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,680
housing is Bugzilla so that's illa for

00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:16,650
example we are powering party is p1 p2

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:18,990
p3 p4 p5 or unset what a p1 but MEPs who

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,690
one team is not bought up he won but

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,210
meant to another team we have to be that

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,030
consistent so that we can see where work

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,340
out and I would keep push ups push back

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,730
door people saying Emma why do I care

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:35,460
about another team thinks of p1 is and

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,580
it's like well now if I not matter to

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,260
you but it does matter to the rest of

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,010
the organization it matters to release

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,140
management

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:49,290
if I tell release management there are

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:52,380
50 p1 bugs active the release management

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:56,190
wants to expect that p1 means the same

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,980
thing if not well it's 50 P ones in dog

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,830
and 50 P ones that have slightly

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:07,950
different meaning in AV already sees me

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:10,470
enough in in audio and video so getting

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,870
people to be consistent about how many

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:23,580
triage decisions was the third critical

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:26,760
piece to do that now I would call out

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,950
the things that we learned doing this

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,530
because this is it you know this is an

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,510
extreme case this is a push where was

00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,640
essentially betting the future of

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,580
Firefox of the Mozilla project on this

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,180
so we were willing to you know push a

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:45,060
little harder work a little longer

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,300
process chart we have some cases where

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,010
bugs were being trapped multiple times

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,450
engineers do not like that when you ask

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:56,160
them to look at about the scene but

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:59,400
multiple times pipe energy is required

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,080
for the process we have people working

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,910
weekends and I'm gonna like for people

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:08,160
to work weekends people are on in all my

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,810
hours in our communications channels

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,820
that's one component on having the

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:16,470
communications channel so we had a a

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:20,400
channel just for triage that people

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,810
could go to anyhow questions and I said

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,210
I'm actually and all I got up in the

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,920
morning they myself coffee sat down and

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,709
started answering questions and pretty

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,459
soon it was already 11 o'clock at night

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:34,440
or in the morning but that is a you know

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,410
but having you have not having a

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,260
gathering place plus where people can

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,000
ask questions on the process but again

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,450
you just can't have people doing nothing

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,390
much really bugs third is pushing

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,450
technical death there's a lot of bugs

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,089
that we just basically went I don't know

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,550
p3

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,380
so in our tree upskill p1 is about

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,240
you're walking on now peeling - is the

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,450
bucket you're working on next p3 is a

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,270
backlog we pushed a lot of things into

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,870
the backlog so we essentially created

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:12,959
this debt and create a decision depth as

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:19,430
well as tactical to happen why do we not

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:23,490
have some things that we're doing now to

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:25,560
improve the process and get a little

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,950
better at it one is that we actually

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,839
built some dashboards outside of

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:36,630
bugzilla bugzilla has a fantastic api

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,690
for plugged in and out of it then if you

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,220
use a tool like glitch just curious how

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,700
many of y'all are using glitch to

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,700
prototype things

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:52,529
ooh have some evangelist into dude looks

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:57,660
wonderful which is code for node it's

00:16:52,529 --> 00:17:00,269
built by far Creek software

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,410
you're definitely believers in the open

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:06,449
web you go there you can basically spin

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,130
our project the default project is a

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,780
note server running Express framework

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,880
this is a really great tool for building

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,150
and prototyping dashboards so I

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,050
prototype this dashboard in English and

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:26,069
then I'm just deployed it to corrupted

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:29,280
and we have this our ambient dashboards

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:31,380
at the Mozilla offices all our offices

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,530
throughout the world if you're a remote

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,090
employee can also attach to these sheep

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,340
out to these dashboards and view this

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,720
and this is telling so our hotspots are

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,059
because we really wanted to say let's

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,040
focus on our hot spots like this thing

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,510
about on triage which is our biggest

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,570
source of thoughts these are the bugs

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,240
that come in from the community there's

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:55,200
a large number of these bugs but they're

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,669
all being worked on we do contract with

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:05,100
the company called soft vision again

00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:06,510
office with frontline bug triage the

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,419
other thing we're doing is we're

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,250
improving our documentation around our

00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:16,470
triage process right now true

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,300
documentation exists all over the place

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,950
it's a problem in open source projects

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,669
especially the open source projects have

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,169
a wiki I know some people are filtering

00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,000
roughly about wiki's but I believe that

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:34,410
wiki some places were knowledge does to

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,960
die so I decided to pull out our pre-op

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,870
documentation within the wiki and move

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,150
it into a repository so that I can

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,740
republish it so that there is a source

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:49,919
of truth and that source of truth is

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:52,800
under version control and that's going

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,630
under that's continuous the major thing

00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,620
we're doing next with this

00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:01,230
is looking at timing and scheduling

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:04,230
which has been the thing that we learned

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:08,730
from our engineers is saying this is a

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,470
high-priority bug for us but I don't

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,940
want to work on it this really second

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,300
thought I'd want to say I'm going to

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,770
work on it in a future release cycle the

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,140
piece that we're trying to determine is

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,400
how much do you have to potential

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,370
configuration we have to put into your

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,140
tracker to this and you simply say the

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,370
version for this is future or you

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,900
actually want a roadmap that if we do

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:34,560
this ability to roadmap we're going to

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,940
have to change how it work so that's a

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,750
that's a piece that we're going to have

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,890
to look at and then finally

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,050
documentation I'm not gonna show this

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,410
video but if you search on this one

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,000
YouTube this is the first of a series of

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:54,360
videos that we're doing just to cover

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,190
how you spot Scylla because archery no

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,490
one wants to sit through to our class of

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,770
how to use bugs all people are used to

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,240
watching five-minute videos on YouTube

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,520
or someone explains how quantum

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,230
mechanics works how Dark Matter works or

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,140
how to build a robot that will chase

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,610
your cat so we figured that if we go

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,720
through and take these key concepts

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,300
using Bugzilla

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,670
and I'll make them into these what an

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:23,370
old manager or when an apple called an

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:25,350
info snack if we turn these and we turn

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,930
the training into a set of info snacks

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,480
snacks and people can go through and

00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:34,620
access when you're saying hey I need to

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,450
figure out how to put a notify release

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,740
management about a buck I need to know

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,330
how to triage your dog

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,120
I need to know how to signal other

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,860
buckets or aggression we're trying down

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,140
and the first of the videos is out just

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,930
such a simplest thing is how to read a

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:53,040
bucket box a lot how many times Bugzilla

00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:55,980
is your tracker in your project you

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,650
can't turn over buckle is intimidating

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,180
especially our blocks a lot because we

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,180
have a lot of essentially sitting

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:08,590
soon we're gonna be looking at more

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,909
aggressive buckaroos resolution one of

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,529
the things we notice is that when you

00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:17,440
have 90,000 bugs there are a year or

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:19,120
more that have not been changed in a

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,299
year or haven't been touched you know

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,520
more that's second weight on top of your

00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:29,830
on top of your project sir we're talking

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,049
and we're going to go ahead and make

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,950
resolutions on these bugs we're not you

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,880
know we're not saying that we're all

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,649
fixing them

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,970
we're just saying look this is this

00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,950
hasn't been touched in a year we just

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,200
want to move it off them off of people's

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,880
radar because if no one's touched this

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,750
in a year you're then it's not top of my

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,909
priority

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:55,539
remember that bugs what's the result can

00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:57,610
always be reopened some references if

00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,760
you go to a bikini missile or bug triage

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,799
that is our country of their current

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,490
president reparation we are doing

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,820
archeology of a Firefox project our

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:12,700
matriarch corrupted our comm is that

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,120
dashboard that you saw earlier and then

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,010
on github there and I will make sure

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,409
that I publish these URLs and Felicia's

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,179
talk so you can go back and follow it if

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:28,240
you don't want to try to take a picture

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:30,700
and dislike her I'm here else so finally

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,309
this is what I tell everybody and it's

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,450
terrible and it's a mean that's take

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,450
long triage bugs

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,770
[Music]

00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:47,929
different countries otherwise if you

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,319
want to catch me afterwards I've had a

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:55,329
small number of lumping spins and I will

00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,329
have my sticker bag out during each time

00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:12,409
Wow thank you very much I don't using

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,169
fog obviously in a distribution link of

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:22,999
them to that even whatever do you have

00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:24,469
any insight into that box from that so

00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:26,089
the way that we've been tracking bugs

00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,939
and distributions who have been asked to

00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:31,789
the distribution handle own in their own

00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:33,499
bug trackers this is an area I think

00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:36,469
they need to do some more that we need

00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:38,149
to do some investment in process on the

00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:40,339
best thing you can do is to talk to our

00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:42,829
release engineering team you know

00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:44,209
release me our list management team that

00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,309
I'd be happy to put you in touch with

00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:49,519
them and if you have a lot of questions

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:52,309
with them I know that packagers like to

00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:56,389
work independently but I think having

00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:58,279
routes to to do that because your button

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:00,169
packaging may turn out to actually be a

00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,239
Firefox bug and we need to track it in

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:05,749
in Bugzilla

00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:06,650
yeah and I think this speaks to projects

00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:08,960
like

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,900
as well have the same similar markings

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,270
over this is how is this our problem

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,880
this is your problem three between the

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,730
two it defensive mode going on both ways

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,030
so yeah please do

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,830
yeah and yeah I'm also if he contacted

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,540
why I've got my father got my parts was

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,820
being to be happy to do that even help

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,440
in health care are people this is an

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,130
area to because we're building you work

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:40,010
the Firefox outside of Brazil Central

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:43,520
and outside of buck so if you look at

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,170
the Activity Stream and big pieces of

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,470
the developer tools are being built and

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:52,430
github and this is a big challenge for

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,840
us you know he have a group a working

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,210
group that's trying to figure out that

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,970
ways and handle of how he handled out

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,090
one piece of that repo that I had

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,070
mentioned out the earlier I'm getting

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,720
out for documentation is a process that

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,060
we're trying to use to basically figure

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,130
out okay if you have a regression that

00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,140
is caused by code that is he can get out

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,870
how to can track that inside of a

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,910
penicillin because release management

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,530
wants to look at Bugzilla as a single

00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,020
source of truth they do not want to look

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:24,440
at Bugzilla and fifty different github

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:32,060
because yeah they they do not have the

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:34,970
bandwidth to do that I do see work on

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,970
tales the anonymous

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,929
distribution if you can imagine they not

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:44,539
difficulty with bells in the sense that

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:46,580
you don't necessarily want to give away

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:50,299
that you've been using the product on so

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,070
reporting the bar gets problematic how

00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,799
did you do anything at all with it we're

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,650
kinda matiee in eating bugs and things

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,260
like that even though it's a whole

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:04,280
presentation on itself so that's all I

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,539
have is I have a Community Guidelines

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:12,380
we just recently revised them

00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:16,210
we just recently hired my sibling okay

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:18,980
inclusive just joined us and Z is

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:22,030
helping us with our implementation of

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,860
how we're enforcing our community

00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,530
community guidelines when you go into

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,299
about slowly I will notice in the

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:33,289
besides a comment box that says that

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:35,210
your comments are governed by that

00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:37,750
community participation guidelines

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:43,309
essentially our code of conduct and

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:44,720
that's the netiquette we have some tools

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,820
that were developed from a few years ago

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,000
when we first had some major issues with

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,000
trolling and abuse that like attack

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,679
comments and I can demonstrate that for

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,570
you if you're interested during the

00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:03,890
lunch if you tag a comment has abuse or

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:05,690
admin that shows up on my radar shows up

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,549
on the radar of a couple other people so

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:11,030
we can you quickly look at it and review

00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:13,400
it we are working with with Kate who

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,929
again is army new CBG process

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,870
coordinator we're trying to build out

00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,789
some process around that um the main

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,590
thing is that the stuff that we've built

00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,710
around four or five years ago when we

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,030
were dealing with Australis and removing

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,210
a lot of the old infrastructure around

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,460
themes because of the attack surface it

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,990
exposed the complexities that custom

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,059
themes

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:38,480
cost us that we were getting a lot of

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:41,659
abusive comments we didn't have people

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,210
focused on community so you do what we

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,830
do as engineers is that you build tools

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:51,960
and hope it works so

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:56,040
if a new account was created and it got

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,920
a number of bus marked as spam or abuse

00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,800
in comments than the county shut down

00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:06,360
but there was no follow up and there was

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,400
no notion of radiation so a person would

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,950
say well you're being a little bit

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,350
jittery here you need to step back

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:16,140
versus you know I want to kill you and

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:18,320
your kitten or treated the same way and

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,350
you gotta treat those things differently

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,700
you do have to go through and get people

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,740
to be accountable when they're being

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,870
foolish and they need to shut down

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,330
people who are just being abusive right

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,250
off the bat so there's a long answer to

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,890
your question about doing this anemone

00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:38,790
that with with properly complex and

00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:42,300
bucks a lot it's an area that we're

00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:45,930
still working on but we are building out

00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:50,990
infrastructure on it again if you look

00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:53,520
at the look also Kate's boss in Merlin

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,570
and I'm a professional they call each

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,160
other other I'm on everyone has got a

00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,250
lot post on meeting and talking about

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,270
how tell your children in the community

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:08,580
process and I'm feeding management

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,720
throughout the Mozilla project so thank

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,590
you for your questions

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,280
I think we kind of a couple of versions

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:19,200
I think we still have some time yes

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,490
thanks for great presentation so one of

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,730
the problems with bugs is that it's

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,740
sometimes hard to know what component

00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,530
broke so maybe it's the Dom may miss the

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,590
J's and his name is Devi so the other

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,450
problems with mislabelling what art and

00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,700
how he tried to reduced up and they

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,799
maybe have some stats so I'm like how

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,840
many times a usual what guessing

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,869
label difference gets the direction of

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,909
components on average it's about about

00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:47,489
one or two times between one or two

00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:50,009
times it takes for a bug that is not

00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:53,159
filed by a personality flaw insider to

00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:55,649
the project anything about fought by

00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,570
answer to their project can get it wrong

00:29:55,649 --> 00:30:00,539
I can get it wrong because I'm not

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:04,799
living the source code the way that that

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:05,909
engineers do you're looking at some

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,669
techniques we actually have an

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:13,879
experiment going on using machine

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:16,889
learning to help us categorize bugs

00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:19,889
right now all the results are not pretty

00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:21,659
good where we're looking at what other

00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:25,200
melody that we can use on a bunch of

00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:29,369
trainer supreme' predicts six to

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,590
successfully predict for guns yes even

00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,779
if you do not again any sort of machine

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,169
learning process requires humans in the

00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,789
loop because otherwise you're just going

00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,980
to make people very angry it's like

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:43,649
using machine learning to moderate

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,869
Twitter all you do is you never we don't

00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:47,519
actually shut down the Nazi accounts be

00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:53,909
shut down all the funny accounts that

00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:56,070
people love so but journal is a thing

00:30:53,909 --> 00:31:05,639
especially if we go back to this slide

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:07,799
we see can I go back I'm here you see

00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:11,519
this top of what a category Farquharson

00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:14,489
triage with a hundred twenty six bucks

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,909
that need a decision decision that is

00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:19,440
the place where we really have to be

00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:26,249
better about getting the bug to their

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:30,359
own component from there when there's

00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:32,749
one more question yes you mentioned that

00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,399
you're doing some training for able to

00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:38,489
to make it easier for people to get

00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:42,710
started with training but I mean since

00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:45,680
you're also knows LS also making

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,740
you also make modifications to the cell

00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,540
itself to make work better variable as

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,160
part of this process as well or is it

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,010
something you're looking into ok

00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:00,620
whatever could you repeat the question

00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm sorry oh yeah from the training are

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,140
you arguing also making changes to the

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:10,160
bacilli itself to make it work better

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:14,690
for you or Florida contributors yes this

00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:17,990
has been an ongoing process again our

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:20,060
engineering focuses on on firefox and

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,980
the firefox related browsers we don't

00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,560
have a lot of engineering resources that

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,230
we're putting into bucksaw but we have

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,240
been gradually over time making some

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:34,340
changes to bustable to make it easier to

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,500
use easier to read my clothing co head

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,440
who was a contributor based out of

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,550
Toronto and I am blanking on the name of

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,550
his Twitter believe it is bugzilla UX he

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:49,210
has been a person who's been focused on

00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,680
improving the usability of bugzilla I

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:55,970
would advise following his read his

00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,740
tweets his a lot of ideas were helping

00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,410
to be able to implement we do have the

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,330
services of another engineer who is

00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,610
helping us with some UX work and some

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:08,510
API work but we do know that bugs

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:10,070
illness intimidating and needs but we're

00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,530
moving I think hopefully in the right

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,420
direction especially the work that we've

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,410
done on the top menu bar over the past

00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,540
few months the switching into the Model

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:25,400
View has her default call that little

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:27,170
sir has not evolved you view that at

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,240
least says things like meat the butter

00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:33,500
looked faster because previously where

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,540
you could do editing by default we were

00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,020
looking too much there's other things we

00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,870
need to do such as just limiting lean on

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:45,410
stuff that would have to download to

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,590
look at it about we need to go back

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:51,250
through if you're interested in this

00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:54,070
bucks a lot are the Mozilla bugzilla

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:58,720
about github and they'd surely accept

00:33:54,070 --> 00:34:02,710
Laura plus autocomplete we have to knee

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,420
drop demons that are are you know 200

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,850
items they should not be dropped in

00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,650
associate the autocompletes if you're

00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,600
interested in helping us with that that

00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,130
would really be great and we have some

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,710
frameworks that we want to use and again

00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:16,120
Kohei would be a person to Courtney that

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:19,390
would if you want to help us opposed

00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:22,030
excellence ability if you're interested

00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,580
in three option box I can point you at

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,610
Qs a box like the Firefox in triage with

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,320
you and you know even if you know if

00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,430
you're Harrison just looking at one or

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,090
two bucks a week

00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:37,000
that would also be a great help help we

00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:38,770
are a community driven project we got a

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,770
little bit more navel-gazing

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:45,070
I think over the past year or so as

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,450
we're working on getting Firefox calm

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:50,140
down we were learning how to work

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:52,480
community again but I do not want to

00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:56,590
drive you away if you're interested in

00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:00,240
helping anything else so I believe

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,240
everybody yes

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,580
