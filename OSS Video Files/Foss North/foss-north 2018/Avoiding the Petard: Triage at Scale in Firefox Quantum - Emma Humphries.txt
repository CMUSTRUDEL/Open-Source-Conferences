Description: 
	The bug that could had sabotaged a year of work on Firefox didn't slip into production because of the efforts of engineers, program managers, and management to triage bugs. But how do you triage 9,000 bugs over the course of a three month release cycle and not burn out? How do you measure hotspots? And how do you make it sustainable? The Firefox team's bugmaster, Emma Humphries, reports on what one of the largest and longest-lived open source projects learned while building this milestone version of the beloved web browser.

Emma Humphries believes in making safer spaces for underrepresented groups in tech, the healing power of Sleater-Kinney's "Dig Me Out," coffee, and the Open Web. For the Mozilla project she helps people to file better bugs earlier in the release cycle, and helps engineers make decisions on those bugs faster. She started working on the Web when she asked the Tiptree Award's Motherboard if she could make a website for them. She still has the original site on a 3.5" disk.
