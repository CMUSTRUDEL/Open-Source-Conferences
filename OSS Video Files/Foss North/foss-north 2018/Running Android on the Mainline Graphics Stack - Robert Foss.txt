Title: Running Android on the Mainline Graphics Stack - Robert Foss

Description: 
	Finally, it is possible to run Android on top of mainline Graphics! The recent addition of DRM Atomic Modesetting and Explicit Synchronization to the kernel paved the way, albeit some changes to the Android userspace were necessary.

The Android graphics stack is built on a abstraction layer, thus drm_hwcomposer - a component to connect this abstraction layer to the mainline DRM API - was created. 

Moreover, changes to MESA and the abstraction layer itself were also needed for a full conversion to mainline.

This talk will cover recent developments in the area which enabled Qualcomm, i.MX and Intel based platforms to run Android using the mainline graphics stack.
