Title: Isolating GPU access in its own process - Patricia Aas
Publication date: 2018-04-30
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	Chromium's process architecture has graphics access restricted to a separate GPU-process. There are several reasons why this could make sense, three common ones are: Security, Robustness and Dependency Separation.

GPU access restricted to a single process requires an efficient framework for communication over IPC from the other processes, and most likely a framework for composition of surfaces. This talk describes both the possible motivations for this kind of architecture and Chromium's solution for the IPC framework. We will demonstrate how a multiprocess program can compose into a single window on Linux.

Patricia Aas is a C++ programmer working on the Vivaldi Browser where she has currently taken on platform integration of media. She has previously worked at Opera Software on their Desktop Browser and at Cisco on their Telepresence Hardware Endpoints, primarily on Linux. Patricia is a curious person, always trying to find out how things work. She hopes that we will find a way to make the world a better place by creating things that can be used for good.
