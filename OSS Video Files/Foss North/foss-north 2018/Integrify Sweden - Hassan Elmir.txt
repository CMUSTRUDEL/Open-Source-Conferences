I think it's fun

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,310
alright thanks for come

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,199
session my man is a Hassan I made and I

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,199
will be talking about Integra fights

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,810
freedom which is a project that I

00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,599
started with a colleague of mine Niklas

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:36,670
wind art and the reason why we started

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,440
this project was we wanted to do

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,960
something that creates an impact on

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,230
people that can actually change people's

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,659
eyes to the better we wanted to be a

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,320
force of good and with this project we

00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:52,449
found that way to make the impact that's

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,309
what I told this this picture a gaze

00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:56,980
into the universe think about life and

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,920
what you want to do in life and this is

00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:04,860
part of what we would want to do in life

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:09,759
to want to do something good so what is

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,250
integral Phi it's a product basically to

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,759
help newly arrived refugees and

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,910
immigrants help them through the process

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,689
to get a job in Sweden and of course we

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:26,770
target people who have software

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:30,369
backgrounds so we are about 13 people I

00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:33,369
think at the moment that work with us on

00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:36,840
our free time so this cannabis side

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:39,790
project that we do whatever we have done

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,470
the people are involved in does come

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:46,119
from many different areas we have

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:49,960
software engineers we have recruiters we

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:55,180
have people that work as managers with

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:58,799
coaching recruiters why do a group of

00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,030
people that can help in different ways

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,899
so that the problem is that when people

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:08,530
come here to Sweden it's very very

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,179
difficult to establish into society it's

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,630
a long process and there's a lot of

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:17,200
different government agencies that they

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:20,609
have to go through every step takes a

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,049
long time so it's a very tedious process

00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:24,220
and it doesn't really help that a lot of

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,420
these people who come

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,480
we have a big gap in their CV because

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,890
communities come from Syria then you

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,260
probably have haven't coded for a while

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,350
because of the war and then you leave

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,840
there go from country to country you end

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:44,050
up in Sweden go through the process so

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,970
some people have maybe three years where

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,900
they haven't done anything and we know

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,700
that this industry moves very fast so it

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,630
adds up to the problems or the

00:02:51,700 --> 00:03:00,580
difficulty for the family so what we try

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:03,550
to do is bring them in we host a small

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,980
studio with laptops we let them work on

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,780
a project and then in the end they will

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,390
have a prototype that they can use when

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,830
they are looking for jobs here show what

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,410
they can look at what they can do

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,600
I also they would get us as references

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,320
so they can put us they can put Swedish

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,580
people me and others in the tegra fight

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,590
put us as references when they are

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,130
looking for jobs and also in the end

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:32,340
they will get like a validation of their

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,340
competence so we do this together

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,989
Swedish public tours together and we

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,550
create this validation what each team

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:47,580
member has knowledge and they can use

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,170
that when you're looking for jobs

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,739
so up until now we have people from many

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:56,620
different countries it has been very a

00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:01,810
big mixture of different people so it's

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:06,580
been very interesting so if you industry

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,799
for sweats off - I also think our

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,910
sponsors here right partners partners

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,030
yes so they are independent Association

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,269
that works towards increasing Swedish

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:22,030
global competitiveness when it comes to

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,190
software industry and they came up with

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,060
a report that they they have to get

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,470
handled over

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,380
presented it to the Swedish parliament

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,620
not long ago in that report they

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,750
concluded that almost half of the

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,990
Swedish companies and this is not just

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,260
the IT companies this is all the

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,110
companies in Sweden say that they didn't

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,650
expand as much as they wanted due to

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,260
lack of developers a third of the

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,630
companies companies developed some form

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,750
of software in-house so it could be a

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,970
website or app or whatever but almost a

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,000
third of the companies have some form of

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,650
software development in-house so when

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,570
you look at this figure it thicknesses

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,760
it becomes very clear that this is

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,550
important for Sweden to make use of all

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,950
the competence that is within the

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:17,260
country in order to keep this global

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,880
competitiveness and the in light of

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,640
these numbers and not of what's

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,700
happening we we feel that we are right

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:31,180
in time that we can actually provide

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:34,180
some form of solution at least for us so

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,300
if you look a bit on the timeline how we

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,210
started with this some authors have

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,010
concerns now I don't know if you guys

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,830
read the power meters or if you're

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,289
politically interested but in 2015

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,289
there's a big amount of people coming in

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:54,520
to Sweden and even other countries from

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:57,820
Europe from Syria and that created a lot

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,789
of pressure on the agencies so the

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,310
process is to get people in into work or

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:07,450
into society it became even longer

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,310
because the killer tumbled everything so

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,600
that's that's basically when we started

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,940
to think how can we help what can we do

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,720
to reach him and do something about this

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,580
instead of just whining about it has

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,840
many many people might too

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,780
so we can capture innovation where I was

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,630
the time we try to develop this this

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,490
idea into something that we can work but

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,980
we didn't really know exactly what to do

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,430
and how to go about it it was very fuzzy

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,220
in the beginning so what we did was we

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,320
actually had a meeting when the artists

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,900
media that the Swedish public key on the

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,030
formal service together with a lot of

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,480
different company representatives to

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,630
talk about this what can we do to help

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,620
in this situation

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,660
obvious meaning that they have a very

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,669
different views and than we have at

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,760
capture innovation they wanted everyone

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,680
to basically go back to University and

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,770
get the formal degree a Swedish degree

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,340
and then also known Swedish and then

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:13,320
swatch forgot and I don't really agree

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,550
with that we're in the software industry

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,750
so it's very easy for someone to prove

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,020
what what they know prove their

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:25,260
knowledge people work on hobby projects

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,580
they work on different kind of projects

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,620
and we can show them up and have

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,440
technical discussions 3ds if you knowing

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,650
someone as a lawyer or someone actually

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,039
knows how to code so we know that it's

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:40,669
not really necessary to have a degree in

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:44,280
the beginning and that is that meeting

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:47,640
was really when we started to understand

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,419
how we wanted to go about this so this

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:54,389
is when we decided how we wanted to

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:57,919
bring in people unhelpful so shortly

00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:00,330
after we start interviewing people

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,910
refugees and immigrants interviewing

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,690
people try to pick the first thing so

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:09,479
they could start working with us in

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,460
February 2017 we actually stopped them

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,400
at the first day so they started with

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,760
the project and during the summer we

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,860
created the company Integra v Sweden now

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,570
the goal for the company is not for us

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,610
involved to make money I mean we're

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,310
doing this because

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,960
to do something good but if we can

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,969
manage to make money then we can hire

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,740
people that help in the process you can

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:37,159
bring in teachers we can expand on the

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,810
services that we can give so that's the

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,800
idea about having this company so

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:48,800
shortly after that the team number one

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,529
finisher finishes the project um one of

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,240
the guys get tired and then we stock

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:59,360
with the second team in October they

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:04,100
finished I think two months ago one of

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:08,420
them also the tile team number three and

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,209
I started in the middle of March I think

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,110
something like that so we have the round

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:19,130
three now so yeah that's our journey and

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:23,529
this is very hot at the moment so this

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:26,240
is basically the process the whole thing

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:29,269
so the first part is obviously the

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,209
project so we bring in the people they

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,540
work for anything between three and six

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,130
months on a project and the goal is for

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,250
them to have some some kind of prototype

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:45,079
of a product that they can show to

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:47,240
possible companies that work out so the

00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,649
first thing that happens is that I have

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,610
a meeting with them in the beginning and

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:55,040
I talk to them about agile development

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,589
specifically sprung a lot of these

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,070
people come here they might have heard

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:04,310
about or studied agile and scrum but not

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,250
all of them have really applied it in a

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,930
project for so for us we felt that this

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,810
was really important to bring this

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,209
mountain because as we know it we've

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,430
done all the software or maybe all the

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,880
counseling as well the majority of the

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,380
companies have agile methodology when

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,970
they develop software so it's very

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,000
important

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,970
to get that part as well to make it

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,029
easier for them to find a job so after

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,790
the initial meeting they they are the

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,610
team has a brainstorming and then they

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,129
talk together and basically talk about

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,519
what do they want to achieve in this

00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:44,560
period and then make a plan and after

00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,110
that they stop working during the time

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,230
that they are working we work at the

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:53,680
Integra file integral v Sweden we are

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:56,079
there to help them so obviously we all

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,180
have jobs but we have a snap channel

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,060
where they can mainly have technical

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,759
questions or questions about the process

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,990
for basically any question they can post

00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,240
and we would help them as soon as we can

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:14,199
and for me I'm also evolving the daily

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,870
stand-ups so I enjoy them box type the

00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:19,959
stand up some trying to help them out

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:24,339
whatever day and they also join in for

00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,959
the demos and we tried to create this

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,050
way of thinking that they are delivering

00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:33,420
to a customer to make sure they

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:38,259
understand the importance of the demos

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:41,649
all these points to make it as real as

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:44,199
possible and that will be done when they

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,420
normal the project we have a big demo

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:49,589
when we invite a lot of people in what

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,819
recruiters and company representatives

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,980
and they basically come and have a

00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,689
chance to talk to this to the group and

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,389
the group the most what they have done

00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,339
show off what they are going to do in

00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:02,889
this period

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:06,730
yeah hopefully make new contacts and

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:08,470
maybe find a job and after that when

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:14,199
we've done the demo we have we answered

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:16,870
the evaluation point so in this stage we

00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:19,329
have we work at Integra for at least

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:23,290
some of us we have one-on-one meetings

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,569
with all the team members interviews and

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,730
every one of us take a different angle

00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:31,460
in interviewing

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,670
so what we try to do is to understand

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,070
the technical level skill level or every

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,010
team member we look at the other skill

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,990
teams clear leadership everything and

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,690
try to make like an evaluation for each

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,430
piece first of course together with the

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,160
code as well so we look at the code as

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,980
well all of that will result in an

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,190
evaluation that will be the basis for

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,560
the verification that they get from our

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,830
vestibular so in the end they will get

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,710
the paper says that ok this person he is

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,470
at this level on these things it's

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,990
pretty detailed and go through like step

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:13,000
was that what they have done on what

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:16,850
they argue not and then they are good to

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,370
go they start looking for work and even

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:23,180
in this case we have people involved in

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,480
the project that can help out at this

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,750
pace we have people that can coach them

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,460
what to think about in an interview we

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,700
have people that help them look at the

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:39,290
CVS help them refine that the CDs and

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,110
the personal cover letter and then also

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,880
we have recruiters that have contact so

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,460
they also try to pull some threads and

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,550
see if there is a need somewhere we can

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,200
make a connection so yeah this is

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,820
basically and we've been doing this for

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,870
three rounds up now we're entering the

00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,570
13 I think they have done one sprinter

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,880
in there the second sprint at the moment

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,230
and that's before I forget they're after

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,230
sitting here the team members

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,040
we can talk to them has some questions

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,410
[Music]

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:25,189
Grantham there they don't want a very

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:29,050
friendly great bunch of people so yeah

00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:32,029
take the opportunity and talk to them so

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,759
yeah this is a picture from the last

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:37,759
demo we have so this was in Indiana when

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,249
they finished the product and we invited

00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,589
a lot of recruiters and company

00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:45,279
representatives and then they the team

00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:48,860
has a chance to show what they have done

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,790
and their main goal and try to make some

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:56,149
contacts through contacts

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,259
yeah this is from standoff last week

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,170
actually on Friday

00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:02,089
so it's me that I find anonymous can and

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,589
this is the team basically in the

00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:10,579
building we have she'll talk about that

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:15,050
here he actually is on passport he evens

00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:16,179
at Volvo as a business analyst is wrong

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,749
with our team

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:24,829
what is this project to be the product

00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:26,779
or customer for a team so he has an idea

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:29,269
and he comes in as a customer and we

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,449
have the team who has to work on it and

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,579
deliberate and working on her way

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:36,750
towards that the customer so that was a

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,699
bit of a twist

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,790
a different way of doing that I think

00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:44,519
it's really great so I think this one

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,970
would be very interesting to see it then

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,420
this one but then we have also of course

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:55,410
to the first project was about creating

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:59,189
a website that would be like a meeting

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,680
forum for people to connect for refugees

00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:03,839
immigrants and sweets to connect and

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,420
they can learn about the Swedish culture

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,300
or Swedish food everything Swedish

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,480
basically so the novel be basically

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:16,649
about to that website and the second

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,439
project we bought in a robot that they

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:22,259
could work so they put the second team

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,930
created a website where the user would

00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,120
log in the register register log and

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,430
take control over the robot time to

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
screen video to website

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,300
that's what they could remove the

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,629
control drive around and get some

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,029
information so in that particular is

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:54,959
everything from coding C code on the

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:57,480
robot to not ASP so what have we seen

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,370
from this I mean longest voice and now

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:05,069
we're in the third row first screen I

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:09,089
see a big difference than how they use

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,370
the agile methodology I mean I I'm with

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:14,669
them almost every day during the

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:18,240
stand-ups and I know that in the

00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:22,850
beginning it's difficult to wrap your

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:28,079
head around this from the story points I

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:29,760
remember when I first yeah you don't

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,070
really have to make time you estimate

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,360
gummi bears so

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:39,030
you estimate something it's not tangible

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,930
it's a relative thing that you try to

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,880
estimate but in the end that I think

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:49,470
most of them understand start to

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,660
understand the value of our scope first

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:56,940
we found to see the purpose of that is

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:59,190
to compare the beginning of another the

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,380
the people that we have participating in

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,290
us or they were really really passionate

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,320
they're engaged and they're really

00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,720
hungry for us so we found to work with

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,510
them and they take it really seriously

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,960
and have pride in what they do so you

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,240
really think about everything from the

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,690
cold structure make it a good home base

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,380
to modifying the layout or website to

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:28,260
make it look really nice for the demo so

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:32,460
yeah it doesn't really fun to do didn't

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:38,640
mean I'm really glad that we started

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:40,830
this thing so that's what basically if

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,290
you want to get involved in any way or

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:47,010
if you have any question or if you want

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:51,080
you want to hire people or whatever if

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,080
you want to say hi drop me an email

00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,740
