Title: Crowdfunding, open source and communities - Patricia Ilin and Dimitris Platis
Publication date: 2018-04-27
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	Crowdfunding campaigns enable individuals to bring their ideas to production by appealing directly to the end-market and the global community. A number of these projects are open source, seemingly, counteracting the funding process.

We interviewed founders, developers and managers of 13 crowdfunding initiatives involving open source products to determine how communities, crowdfunding campaigns and open source are associated.

Our findings verified the existence of common characteristics among the cases, the emergence of a family-like relationship between the organizers and the community, as well as the community perceived as a success factor. We suggest that the development of certain niche products inherently leads to the adoption of open source as a licensing model and crowdfunding as the capital gathering process.

hello

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,670
[Music]

00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,559
today

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,770
[Music]

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,420
all right so I'm a mass of students

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,960
Gothenburg University

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm studying digital leadership and for

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:22,990
this we can actually also organizations

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:29,470
called that shape we are promoting women

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:32,799
in technology so many girls that are

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:39,819
interested in technology we are trying

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:41,619
to create a bridge to them and so my

00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:46,750
interests are communication digital

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:49,720
innovation of governance and change hi I

00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,030
am the interest work software

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,270
engineering active where we are bringing

00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:01,590
you know some payment system based on

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:03,549
Android industry on my spare time I

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,950
develop open source software and

00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:09,489
hardware that usually like to look about

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:13,329
and particular interests are making my

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:16,410
little gadgets ite optics and some

00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,410
exciting stuff

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,780
so what study this actually started off

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,430
as my bachelor's thesis I have been

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,079
interested on the source and I'm

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,570
fascinated about the fact that it's an

00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,340
open transparent way developing products

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,440
and at the same time we have

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,350
crowdfunding which is also a transparent

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,670
and open way of monetizing so the idea

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:42,910
behind it was what's up with them and

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,989
they be combined or what's going on with

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,380
them and what nothing is also the this

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,840
study actually

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:57,170
to the wealth of the sources let's

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,030
conference so I will go a little bit

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,550
over the background so we can all be on

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,390
the same page just clarify some key

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:08,030
terms let you know what these results

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,200
that you're gonna hear are clickable

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,700
four and so on

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,250
so very key terms open source we know

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,710
it's code for another source that can

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,070
comprises soap learn how the products

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:25,040
that can be reduced access redistributed

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:28,010
sold and so on so on for any reason

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,200
crowdfunding collective form of

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,360
monetizing or breaking thumbs together

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,550
for a product usually by small amount

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,410
communities we refer to us virtual

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:44,960
communities communities of practice and

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:48,620
so on now what is the main difference

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,770
between open-source software and

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,650
open-source harder for us at least there

00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,690
is that in the properties the design is

00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:01,220
open so not really the physical object

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:06,080
the physical object is not protected by

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:08,720
any license so the design is open in

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,850
software the code is open but the main

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,190
difference is that on Hardware

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,609
fabrication is not free so you always

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,770
have to pay something to create the

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:22,400
physical object well in software it's

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:25,100
most likely free or the cost unlike the

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,760
power of your computer stands here I

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:32,890
would like to take it said that all is

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,690
not in the room because in another

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,240
tricky part is how do you make a request

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,280
in Hardware project how do you verify

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,140
how do you make a discussion somebody

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,880
would have to either review your

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,550
schematics but it could be also the

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,780
layout of your board and then what they

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,639
would have to

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,919
you would have to do it for them so the

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,550
pull request is steep but it's much

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:59,850
larger in hardware but let's say the

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,510
main problem is that fabrication is not

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,910
very portable so the project we're going

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,850
to look to where we have over all

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:12,570
classified open source projects based on

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,960
the customer availability and relative

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,660
importance so we saw the most

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,840
crowdfunding projects out there but

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,500
especially the ones we looked into there

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,330
they were other are give me a very

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,370
narrow market segment let's say makers

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,400
and hackers so we have classified the

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,280
mass of low customer applicability they

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,150
were not mainstream project for anybody

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,520
it was still developer friendly very

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,520
tech team iterative people and they

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,919
could be either low profile wish or high

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,050
profile users so there is also going to

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,360
hear about later are for these kind of

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,039
products we might be able to generalize

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,660
them but you would need more research

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,320
little bit on by the on the methodology

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,320
by Patricia

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:25,530
the second one was the relationship

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:30,650
between workers and in order to do that

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:34,500
we interview people and have one or more

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,360
open-source crowdfunding campaigns like

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,160
that so they weren't only founders they

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:54,870
were also developers and campaign

00:06:38,160 --> 00:07:09,630
organizers meaning that they like no and

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:11,690
even when it hurts most products in this

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:30,090
study their physical so we have a

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:33,479
hardware case both so I'm gonna go

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,830
briefly over the results so let's talk

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,690
about the characteristics that the

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:41,430
sinker the receive so open-source

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:44,940
products being contacted the first

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,710
question we asked people and I think we

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,150
have some people from your life who

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,949
would also be interested to talk about

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,610
them about cases

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,199
why did they choose funny so there were

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,870
some common patterns and these are the

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,960
most significant ones so let's see

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,940
firstly they wanted to get feedback they

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,319
wanted to inspire other people through

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,009
the source of the product and a side of

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,480
inspiring raise awareness so for example

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:16,200
like Arduino did with

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,680
systems or with interative things with

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,630
some Robitaille I remember in the

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:26,010
kingdom or computing for children but

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,280
another one was they wanted to give back

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,930
they have used sources they have used

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,690
health of the community they have used

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,860
so many open-source schematics available

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,140
they have used so many open-source

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,200
libraries so they actually felt the need

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,630
to give back and of course another main

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,910
reason was that the targeting they often

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,710
expected open so it is very important so

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,230
if you are making a development board

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,230
it's probably a good idea to make us not

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,780
to pick open so other skin not just use

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:59,840
it to make a profit but we use it to

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:02,250
make an actual commercial product again

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,760
community expected it but it was also

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,180
very open entry so they showed they the

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,660
community found out that adopting a

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,090
bottom-up funding process they saw it as

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,640
not being so commercial even though it

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,160
might have been but they found it very

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,560
appealing to them so oh it's cool they

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,690
they they don't go to behind closed

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,390
doors to gather in mind they come to us

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,300
directly and ask to fund their dreams in

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,100
a way open source the fact that they

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,160
were open source gave them more

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,250
publicity especially among the target

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,560
group so many tech blocks and so so on

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,720
perhaps they mentioned any more some

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,940
website like Hockaday huckster and so

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,550
they mention it more because it's open

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,650
source so we should promote it and of

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,740
course they found out that releasing a

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,600
source inspires if we make them

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,190
experiment gives them a bit higher the

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,210
feeling of belongingness makes this

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,120
goodwill

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,820
approach tools we saw that was very

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,520
important people kept mention

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,530
you have to be nice people it's there

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,710
it's the essence of the campaign do you

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:14,750
have to be nice to them and so finally

00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:18,170
for many of them especially the ones

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:21,530
that were more tech related or low level

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,180
tech or many of them come from the most

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,310
basically the only option they could not

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,670
get money from venture capitalists

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,070
because they saw open source either us

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,380
what is this this is not professional or

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,510
even negative me they found open source

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,240
or they've you know persons as a way to

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,820
devaluate their I pee collection

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,860
probably also they were very afraid of

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,680
paying what if somebody to the

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,590
market they bigger company or a company

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:56,600
from China just take your stuff we'll

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:59,560
make a clone and then the final in this

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,790
case it was a positive attribute that

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,050
having a did or not identity but

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,560
personal community early on in the

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,180
process makes from funding a rather safe

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,010
choice because you already have the

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:18,110
crowd so they're gonna probably give you

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:24,890
money for it so it was very good option

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:29,480
and perhaps in some cases the only the

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:31,520
source release just before then that

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,440
they complained were after they campaign

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,730
and reasons given releases like they

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,220
make you said they don't want to be

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,250
beaten to the market then you want to

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,680
ensure aperture and the code they

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,870
want to create suspense they want to

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:50,330
make people excitement and you want to

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:51,890
trap more factors but what about context

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,220
I mean where they're great them being

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:58,550
copied this is actually interesting

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,860
because some people saw this as a as a

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,379
threat to their

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,839
imitation while others services form of

00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:11,040
success because they were so good that

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,680
people wanted to copy them and I don't

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,519
know all these wanted to be my suspect

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,870
and doing that they strengthened the

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,449
relationship to their communities

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:27,079
because a loyal community is less likely

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:30,480
to back a clone another much that's

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,339
another approach that some have to this

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:39,600
work that they actually did release

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:42,389
partners at all so this is a little bit

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,699
sad for our sanity not making notes up

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,490
for our software developers so people

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:50,579
who are all expected software to come

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,709
for free the many kept saying yeah if

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,490
you make just software don't expect

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,139
people to be so willing to pay for it

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,540
and this was again a recurring theme so

00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,610
men were saying if you want people to

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,410
fund your product yeah it better have

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,009
some hardware elements I believe that

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,899
was the case I think the codes the right

00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,730
is from the guy who made the micro

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,920
Python and if I'm not terribly mistaken

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,040
is about on the campaign included the

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,279
development core to go along with his

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,500
Python to basically see library so even

00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,600
if he made a software library but he

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,130
just gave the hardware on the side so

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:32,639
people will actually pay for it so

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,709
people generally people like open source

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,089
but at the same time they don't really

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:42,990
want to pay for software so it makes you

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:45,059
think that even not to pay for stuff

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,550
that they did have to pay for anyway

00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,970
regardless of its that because hardware

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,809
products you have to pay for that so it

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,059
makes you wonder about yeah but but what

00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:59,069
gives us for our software people makes

00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,439
it through the opportunities that people

00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:03,990
wanted to pay for either hard work or

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,710
more specifically services so you can

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,540
make a nice open platform and

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:12,180
maybe makes a cloud service along with

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,340
and people don't have a polling paper a

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,440
little bit about the relationship

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:22,990
between crowdfunding campaign campaign

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:27,010
monitors and communities so over only

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:31,480
these soy does the wake test product

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:33,100
will be debated they they use the

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,950
community as a way of like direct

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,830
feedback remains constant people

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,750
contributions could be not necessarily

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:46,270
in hope that it could be also ideas and

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:48,820
usability remarks another thing at least

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,280
in the beginning of when Patricia was

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,200
telling me about I thought that you

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,180
really have to make sure that the

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,550
community was formulated around your

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,010
product so a very dedicated community if

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,320
you have product X there's like an X

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,690
community that talks about this

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,340
continuously this was not really

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,080
necessary this was not the case you

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,120
could utilize that more it's a

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,030
surrounding communities that are all and

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,330
just they use your product in their in

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:19,870
their applications but they don't have

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:23,170
to devote the whole time around so it

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:25,750
was most cases yeah there were some

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,060
cases they already had the community

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,920
before the campaign but in most cases

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,170
there was never community around the

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,240
product so I think it's actually a good

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,930
thing that we don't have necessarily to

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,670
strive to create a very hardcore fashion

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,560
group around your product people can

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,860
just reduce your product and make other

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,860
cool stuff

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,160
so and kitchen savages were both online

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,360
and offline with online being mainly

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,760
Facebook and Twitter and of course

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,010
updates on crowdfunding platforms and

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,500
offline it was conferences like this one

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,480
and make it first overall they found out

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,360
that offline communication despite being

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,860
very useful and very satisfying it did

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,510
take a lot of time so they didn't

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,130
suggest doing it during the campaign

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,250
because you're very busy with other

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,250
things

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,030
so some currently six current thing and

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,280
family like in being nice it was a very

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,380
strong thing yes you have to be nicer

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,700
than you have to treat them well you

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,700
have to show respect

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:36,110
give credit especially for code

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:38,450
contributions and in the end you end up

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,100
with the customers not identifying as

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:44,960
customers but as part of your project

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:48,910
part of your family so somehow on the

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,910
impact of the community of the campaign

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:58,220
so overall open source was not the core

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,170
marketing point so they prefer to market

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,670
towards a broader audience and is the

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:08,089
mean into the more technical stuff makes

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,040
the media were not really excited or

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,170
there is a single different words open

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:17,380
source so they either didn't care or

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:19,550
they didn't know another thing was the

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,000
campaign organizers they have to make

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,070
sure that the community norms and what

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,760
the community expected was in line with

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,270
what the business the business model and

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,390
so on

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,040
so by making sure that these two

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,990
entities communities and the

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,920
crowdfunding campaign were aligned we

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,920
see that there was a big

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,340
and the community impact on the product

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:49,290
then the earlier you open source the

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,210
products the comparatively more

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,710
contributions you will get so there

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,940
could be contributions informants

00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,470
suggestions feedback but or even coat in

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,169
the maturity states clearly love

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,700
listening to user feedback is vital for

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,700
the success of the product industry

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:10,350
community impact on business them most

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:13,890
of them they wanted to create a line of

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:17,850
products that is a small ecosystem and

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,650
in order to do that they had to realize

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,919
that the community was really important

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,660
to to build this sustainable and

00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,070
long-lasting and a line of products

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,510
additionally what we found really

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,919
interesting is that the business

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:34,500
decision to go out the source was

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,120
usually and often taken because of the

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,140
community itself because the expected

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,350
product be open source so we ended up

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,220
with this model I want to bring forward

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:50,700
and propose that is the three is

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,200
crowdfunding open source and communities

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,720
they are so in handle they are so

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,440
tightly coupled once you end up

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,530
developing hardware or sorry a hardware

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,540
yeah niche product you probably will

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,950
have to open source it so to satisfy the

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,110
community and you probably need the

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,730
community because you won't feedback in

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,710
the support and then if you have these

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,740
things it's probably your crowdfunding

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,740
is the only option to monetize so there

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,960
is this vicious circle once you get into

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,440
it you have to do all this thing so

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,430
these are main message issue from this

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,050
study and we're

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:31,320
look forward to verifying it from the

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,760
users of the batter's perspective so

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,140
open source and crowdfunding these are

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:41,170
common pillars that is the communities

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,760
they they'd always campaign organizers

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,310
they found community is very important

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,870
this suit is very they consider it very

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,000
significant to develop a family-like

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,430
relationship with that so they increase

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,020
belongingness and they maybe they're a

00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:58,990
part of the product some form of

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,200
research so what is the community think

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,090
about this so do this investigate is

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,980
topic from the community perspective and

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,750
finally what are the characteristics of

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,450
open or club

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,520
crowdfunding campaigns so a crowdfunding

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,070
platforms that would facilitate such

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:19,210
open source projects I don't know if we

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,610
have time but feel free to contact us we

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,060
will make these questions available

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,060
online

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:46,200
Yonex or we can take single very

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,200
condensed
