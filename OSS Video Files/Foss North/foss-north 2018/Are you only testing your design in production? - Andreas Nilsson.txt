Description: 
	Bad design causes panic and misery, and in some cases, it’s literally lethal. A lot of software is only tested in production, leading to overwhelming amount of support calls and unhappy peers.
Do you wish that people would give you design feedback before you hit the deploy button?
In this talk I’ll show you how you can anticipate design issues using simple user testing methods. These methods will streamline your development process as well as increase the impact that your project has on your community through more intentional design.
I’ll be sharing my experience user testing Cockpit, a server management web console for Linux boxes, and how it has improved the experience we deliver to our customers.
