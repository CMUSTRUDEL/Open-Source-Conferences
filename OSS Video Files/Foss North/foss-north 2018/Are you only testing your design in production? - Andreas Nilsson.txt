Title: Are you only testing your design in production? - Andreas Nilsson
Publication date: 2018-04-24
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	Bad design causes panic and misery, and in some cases, it’s literally lethal. A lot of software is only tested in production, leading to overwhelming amount of support calls and unhappy peers.
Do you wish that people would give you design feedback before you hit the deploy button?
In this talk I’ll show you how you can anticipate design issues using simple user testing methods. These methods will streamline your development process as well as increase the impact that your project has on your community through more intentional design.
I’ll be sharing my experience user testing Cockpit, a server management web console for Linux boxes, and how it has improved the experience we deliver to our customers.

all right

00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,230
I don't care around here all right hello

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,730
yeah

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,070
today I want to talk about testing only

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,750
deduction or our testing on the in

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,610
production okay hi I'm Dresden I work as

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,309
a UX designer at Red Hat's

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,769
in the past I've been involved in get

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:41,140
home I used to work for Mozilla for a

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:45,220
while and then I've been a credit for

00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:49,799
the last five years working on Red Hat

00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:53,699
Enterprise Linux and more specifically

00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:57,489
the console for Rena that regressives

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:03,059
carpet which is also which is a

00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:07,049
administration UI for administrators

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:16,150
more specifically people who are new to

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:22,000
Venice and yeah alright so on the

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:25,450
perfect of January this year the citizen

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
of the state of Hawaii woke up the disk

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:33,130
message in their phone that there was an

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,930
incoming missile attacked the weeks

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,880
before that's the old tone between North

00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:45,040
Korea and the United States that really

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,990
gone badly so it was not a big stretch

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,470
to think that this would be a nuclear

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,900
missile attack so people got very afraid

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,280
we got panicked you know people who were

00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:00,430
on the way to work they they ran to seek

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,830
shelter in towns people try to call

00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,049
their loved ones to say okay this is it

00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,649
you know we have a good time that I

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:11,950
guess this is it you know you've gotta

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:14,230
connect in general to 9-1-1 number

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:20,560
available because the phone lines were

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:22,540
so overwhelmed but it turned out it was

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,599
actually only a false alarm

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:31,780
and people got to notice like 30 minutes

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:34,290
later they got this message and the

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,540
whole reason why this happened was

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,069
because it was later discovered it was a

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,590
human error the operator of the system

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,380
so the missile alert system of Hawaii

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,989
every month they need to do a dry run of

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,349
it but it's not supposed to go out to

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:56,079
dinner or public but the operator have

00:02:53,349 --> 00:03:03,940
mistakenly pressed the wrong button

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:05,950
in the UI that looked like this so it

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,220
wasn't actually a human er it was Lauren

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,799
designer so what we have here is a

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,599
couple of different options and they're

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,980
in this kind of drop-down this is

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,040
nothing actually you like this is out

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,769
maxin approximate action oxygenation of

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,959
the UI because I think like the actual

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:27,310
UI is like secret or something for

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:31,180
military reasons the Opera was supposed

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:34,540
to hit the monthly test but accidentally

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,060
get the real option which is right under

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,069
it which is pack up which triggers the

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,400
whole alarm for the whole island right

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,650
of all right there's also an option for

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:53,769
false alarm that this was added only

00:03:44,650 --> 00:04:00,190
later after that we'll miss alert all

00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:02,790
right and so what way of looking at the

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,010
sign is that it's a rendering of intent

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,500
in the way that everything is actually

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,239
designed even if it's not designed while

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,950
the cell is signed by someone it's

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,290
created by someone

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,560
have an intense in the case of this

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,980
masala alert you are the person who did

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,080
didn't intend for it to be misused in

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,440
that way so that the operator would hit

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,710
the wrong button in the UI but this

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:36,360
happened anyway but they only found out

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:39,000
once the system was in production so

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,690
even even if you're not developing

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,740
missile alert warning systems you you

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:50,440
still have the issue of people using it

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,990
wrongly and then blaming themselves or

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,050
have to get fired over a mistake they

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,810
make like this and the only way to

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:02,050
assure that this doesn't happen is if

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,590
you test it you test the design before

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,590
it doesn't self interruption but and

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:13,150
this you can do with the usability test

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,100
but usually what do you think oh we need

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,970
to do usability test but then you have a

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,169
lot of misconceptions a lot of fears of

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,190
doing it wrong

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:26,440
and so the first here is that the people

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,930
feel like oh they're very big it's very

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,410
complicated to do it I need a very

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,030
expensive a big setup I would need

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,260
something like this that is a usability

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:41,860
lab this is from Oracle

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,280
I think the photos of 2007's by Eugene

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,440
Kim and it's a whole set up here right

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,750
in the back there you have the person

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,160
actually using the computer and then you

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,960
have a person next to them that's

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,760
moderating the test and then you have

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,349
this whole studio that's the second

00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,180
group next phase and you think back in

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,310
the day you really needed this big setup

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,880
because you needed to record an audio

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,039
you don't need to record a video if you

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,340
want to hold it on the team to observe

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,050
the test about intimidating the

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,409
participant too much you have to put

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,999
them in

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,129
separate movement and you had to have

00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:19,659
this two way of Bearer so the

00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:25,449
participant in there they only see a

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:27,369
mirror right like in a crime show but

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:31,389
these days all you need is a laptop

00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:36,759
actually and I'll come back to this in a

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:38,739
bit all right the second here are mr.

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,319
Shelton that people have is that they

00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:47,589
need to be a researcher to conduct a

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:52,329
test like this but you don't like anyone

00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:54,429
can do it it's not that hard and saying

00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,079
you don't have a researcher in your team

00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:58,300
you can still do it it's because it

00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,099
needs to be done if you have a

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,659
researcher that's awesome then he should

00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,550
use that person they will be able to

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:07,749
help you but if you don't you can still

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:11,110
do it because it doesn't need to be that

00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:13,659
exact it's not you know it's not

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,129
scientific research where you need to

00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:19,689
make sure that everything is very

00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:23,169
careful you know and you need to run it

00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,819
very carefully and not mess with the

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,199
data in a sentence but if you do

00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:31,490
usability test it's applied research

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,669
you can you borrow things from

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,590
scientific research some of the methods

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,139
but you don't need to be asked careful

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,259
sorry about what what does that we did

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,659
at work was that we were implementing

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:50,219
software updates of their current system

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:52,020
in our UI and then we had 60 people

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,389
interrupt that were supposed to tested

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,539
over the course of the day so three

00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:01,620
people of the morning and frequently the

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:03,060
afternoon something we figured out very

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,189
quickly with the first three

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,379
participants is that they all thought

00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:10,050
that the system had crashed at some

00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,539
point because it was loading and loading

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,909
and loading that a due to the fact like

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,189
how our cognitive memory work and we

00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:19,020
also use the wrong kinda you Eider we

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,449
found out later so we used a little

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,020
spinner in UI while the page was loading

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:27,860
and it was loading for me not 30 seconds

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,210
one minute's and kept going and going

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,080
did people are crying they were saying

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,440
oh it crashed

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,000
I guess because nothing is happening but

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,880
it wasn't it was running it was just

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,620
waiting for the thing to show up so

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,570
we'll get what we did over rubbish in

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,560
our development team is that the things

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,870
we did some stuff with the caching and

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,120
then we also change it from a spinner

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,209
trip progress bar showing more of a

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,730
vacation because then the people who

00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,029
were supposed to test me afternoon they

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,890
didn't have to go through this again an

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,480
issue we already knew almost error if

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,910
you will you have done scientific

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,320
research for you know if we wanted to

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,390
figure out how the black hole work or

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,890
what it was in physics then we looked at

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,660
being a lot to do that you can't change

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,390
it have fruit but when I use good test

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:24,620
you can because you are only trying to

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:31,260
make supper better you're not trying to

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:32,820
uncover a truth alright so the second

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,819
worry that people didn't have is that

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,660
you will need housing you need to run

00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:42,170
like it

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,920
but a thousand participant to make it

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:50,700
statistically significant which will

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,380
they don't all right say because there

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,610
are some practical implications of that

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,730
all right so if you want to our entire

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:02,580
team to observe these things right and

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:06,210
then you decide all I would run a test

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,330
with 100 participants and then you you

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:13,470
do one hour per participants and then

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:15,480
you end up with 100 hour 100 hours which

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:20,130
is like to book five work weeks that

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,380
your entire team it's fruit all right

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,160
why don't we cut that back to what if we

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,780
did only ten persons that within the

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,790
wonderful participants and it would be

00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:36,900
ten hours of material which is like

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:39,000
little oral dental work day which is

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:43,590
fine so this is actually a graph by

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,080
Jacqueline Nielsen is a palo usability

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:51,270
guide they figured out that most of the

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,460
problems they actually found her early

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,380
in the process and important people that

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,450
has to quit they kept running into the

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:04,640
same things over and over and over again

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:08,850
so let's see all right with five people

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:13,710
we reach like do you find 80% of the

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,690
issues with ten people you find close to

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,630
you know ninety percent of issues and

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:22,020
then it comes out doctor outs acts like

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,570
person number 25 maybe you find some

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,580
little issue again or you know like it

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:31,160
and but then you get Iran into same

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,160
things over and over and over again so

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,680
you can have to do with pact

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,900
participants maybe you you decrease the

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,180
scope but I test a little bit and you

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,340
get the only 30 minutes per participant

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,710
and you have to put five hours and

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,250
that's like you know you can gather your

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,319
whole team

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,569
before lunch one day a week and

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:56,850
everything every one of services and

00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:59,220
everyone learns from these mistakes yeah

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,589
they'd get to know there there used to

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,420
be better and they get to know the

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:08,550
software because the development team

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,560
always have the disadvantage that they

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,910
know too much about how the software

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,949
works under the hood

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,410
we've someone who uses the software

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,329
doesn't know right so you always thought

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,040
that this is a package this kind of

00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:24,149
testing is supposed to be luck we get

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,220
down so if you don't pass test ten

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:31,189
participants you can test two different

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:34,529
things and if you honk 100 participants

00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:38,009
you can test 20 different things you

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:42,000
could either be testing the same thing

00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:45,029
you know wait one day before lunch and

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,339
then you fix it until the next week and

00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:49,079
then you test the same thing again and

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,850
you find some new issues and you fix

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,449
those and by the third week you have

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,970
life radically improve supper or you

00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:00,480
test different aspects of your software

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:05,069
one week and it's not a big investment

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,019
for a team and then you're able to you

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:10,290
know you get an idea if you build

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,209
something you test stats based on that

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:17,399
test you get more ideas that they build

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:20,899
we test them like this entire cycle all

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,959
right Sakuya just wait it's like anyone

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:30,050
well it depends a little bit of the

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:34,379
scope and audience of your target lines

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:38,009
so this is for our products our main

00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,750
audience is juniors is events and and

00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:44,040
when we test with those we get the best

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:47,190
data and then not let excessive it's you

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,470
know people who maybe they've been there

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,350
come on our platforms we had great data

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,990
from them as well maybe not as good as

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,200
like the two nurses events and soccer

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:01,290
developers young people who who mainly

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,210
do suffer development they actually end

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,100
up doing some sigma administration

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,550
because they're setting up their test

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,610
servers but they don't do it as often

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,940
they are still great but you know you

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:18,150
know it's like a decreasing scale and

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,060
then like medical doctors lawyers and

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:24,390
taxi drivers think you can kind of

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,510
it data right even worse if you Tesla if

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,550
we would test with children people never

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,730
used a computer before people who can't

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,100
read and even worse data if it has the

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:41,420
courses of dogs and then like cats and

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:44,190
then posts are yeah you would just read

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,740
but for another products say it's a

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:51,210
medical application you would get the

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,540
best data a doctor and then another

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:57,030
increasing see out there who gets

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,970
pregnant data but now is great mothers

00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,070
or a hospital administrators but then he

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,810
would get really bad theta e to test it

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:09,360
with a junior sis admit or a software

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:13,950
developer okay and when do you run these

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,290
tests it up so here so here's like a

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,880
whole timeline no project I can't

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,220
immediately on this couch a white frame

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:25,200
a prototype and get brauch betta

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,970
and production I was like here is too

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,520
early because you don't have anything to

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,260
test once and here is too late biggest

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,260
step you have it

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,720
production and then someone will press

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,010
the wrong button you get you know

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,200
mechanic over Hawaii

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,300
but anywhere else all over this this

00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,980
course if you do it if you have a sketch

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,870
on paper you can sit down and you can

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,310
test that with someone and you would say

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,800
like well what would you do in this

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,650
scenario in this sketch that I show you

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,620
and you would be able to identify an

00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:00,590
issue very very literally even before

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,000
you do any time programming or any time

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,770
thanks Tara

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,970
whenever from a time you get some ideas

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,760
as well you know betta but you know I'm

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:14,270
like it gets harder are the further in

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,420
the process you get alright so now you

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,480
actually actually do it so perfect need

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,150
to identify your cocktails what is it

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,880
that I'm unsure about how it will work

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,700
in this piece of software what is what

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,340
is it that I don't know if my users know

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:35,680
or but what do I don't know if it's hard

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:38,990
to use or not so write those down and

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,650
then you take a laptop install your

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,830
software on top you can now start a

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:50,840
video game and you can invite your

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:53,210
entire TT you invite the you put the

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,340
participant in front of your computer or

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,670
if you're in your office and they are in

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,040
their office which is a nice and natural

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,930
environment compared to going to coracle

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,220
and sitting in a weird room

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:09,140
it's a kennel lab all right so we have

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,330
freaking of people that are being the

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,940
moderator some people call this this

00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:16,160
facilitator also but it's a person that

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,750
will moderate the entire test and then

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,780
when the participant the person I'm

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,880
going to help test the software and

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,810
you're not testing the person and this

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,640
is critical

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,410
and you need to tell them also we're not

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,170
testing you we're testing the software

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,570
so don't be afraid of doing it wrong and

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,070
then you have the entirety joning as

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,870
well

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,600
all right an evaporator should have

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,710
their audio and video the first

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,870
assumption if there

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:47,260
and video and then they share their

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:50,150
desktop and then the versa team

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,250
dismissal leads to a missile because

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,870
it's very frustrating if you develop the

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,970
piece of software and then you are

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,250
putting someone in front of it and it

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,410
doesn't work quite the thing so you need

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,240
to resist to hurts to scream why don't

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,240
you see it's right there the button

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:11,060
right so that's why you need to keep

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:16,760
them silent all right and during the

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:19,790
test itself the moderator has a skirts

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:24,680
right and this group could be things you

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:28,100
want to find out a volunteer yeah it

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,760
move with tasks so it's like please

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,850
update the operating system what is the

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,590
status of the firewall and please girl

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,770
this storage phone these are things we

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:43,720
test out at work so this is the kind of

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,720
things that the moderator those who this

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,140
scripts and ask these questions

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,780
tried to pass the purple is about to

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:55,370
carry doubts and it's very important the

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:57,230
moderator do not help wrote a blank the

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,600
first thing because it's very easy for

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,270
the participant to be asking for help

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,180
well aware is this thing how do I do

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,670
this how does this work and then the

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,580
moderator should return the question

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,040
will say well how do you think it works

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,650
what would you expect here and a team

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:21,020
should be listening taking notes and not

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:22,520
talking all right and then you carry

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,130
through the thing for fair minutes

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,750
you're recording you right up the

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:33,670
findings a technology anywhere you need

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:36,560
to respect the participants privacy

00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,380
because even though you know you're

00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,450
testing this

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,030
it's never fun to have your name

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,789
attached to a report that says oh this

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,070
person could have quite useless is a

00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:49,380
software because you know it's so easy

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,059
to blame then you search for people to

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,160
blame yourself so they couldn't use it

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,980
because they were too dumb while in

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,990
reality it was the software this was

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,450
found on the side and then he fixed

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,549
issues and then you go over to cycle

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,860
again you tested you have interface with

00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:12,510
the fixed version you build it you test

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:24,240
it new ideas build it test it and that's

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:30,870
it thank you so sue do you reuse the

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:33,240
testers as the person so if you do reuse

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:37,080
the participants so what we have done in

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,450
our product is once someone has tested

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,030
one version you know it's a certain

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,700
aspect of the soccer they're been burnt

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,440
that's because then they only of

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,659
learners right you don't get the first

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,780
experience and you're carrying over

00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:55,230
knowledge from the previous version that

00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,419
you tested so I think it's it's fine to

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,510
reduce the same person's but don't test

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,440
the same thing once again I'm gonna test

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,440
something completely different

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:16,750
I was thinking those different phases in

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:22,480
in software project but scratch sketch

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:26,690
and yeah prototypes and so on is there

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,570
Canoga checklist so guidelines that risk

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:33,649
and aspects you should try to focus in

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:37,100
each one of those areas definitely on on

00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:40,730
sketch face you you have to stay on a

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:45,830
really low level and then little bit not

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:47,570
so that you can do best possible yeah I

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:51,649
think I don't know the sketch phase you

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,470
get an idea you know you you get an idea

00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:57,710
of general they are after something you

00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:04,220
you realize if if the wording you're

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:06,830
using is correct with a but it is very

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,809
low level right I mean it's it's early

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,580
and cheap because you can throw it again

00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:14,659
and test you know just brought something

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:17,750
up and test it again and then say the

00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:20,419
prototype level where you have shitty

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,429
code that you hooked up to false data or

00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:26,149
like a you know we're database that it's

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:30,379
not actually a today movies do you get

00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:32,059
more low fidelity of things with it

00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:35,299
trying to get people's impression of

00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:37,309
color and you get the impression you

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:38,750
know does this look like it's

00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,179
professional enough then things like

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:46,220
that and then you know I got the good

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:48,889
branch he gets like quite good value

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,720
targets but it's also very expensive at

00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:55,700
a point right because you put a lot of

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:58,549
development effort into it so to stem

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,659
except to get better results and of

00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,980
course in production you're dealing with

00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:07,399
the exact data that people would

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,840
actually use and it's it's you know it's

00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:11,750
filled out properly

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,260
but then it's also too late because you

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:17,440
know then it's in production does that

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,440
make sense

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,889
it was

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,839
