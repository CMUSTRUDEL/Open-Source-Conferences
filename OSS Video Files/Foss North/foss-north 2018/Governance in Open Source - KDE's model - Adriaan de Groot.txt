Title: Governance in Open Source - KDE's model - Adriaan de Groot
Publication date: 2018-05-01
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	This talk gives a quick overview of aspects of Open-Source governence -- the importance of licensing, of structures, of process and procedures and some codified behaviors -- and explains how the KDE community implements them. We also discuss ways in which the governance could be improved.

A Canadian by birth and a Dutchman by training, I studied mathematics and computer science (PhD. in formal methods from the University of Nijmegen), pretended I could play a lawyer on TV for a while, and now write Free Software full-time.

and I'm gonna I mean the group is not

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,900
going to talk to you about Katie's

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,820
governance model a little bit of what we

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,760
have in a PhD in computer science in

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,009
completely obscure and relatively

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,040
useless things but I've been doing the

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:36,340
free software since 1989 there's an

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,990
asterisk there because I'm not willing

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,360
this I'm not willing to swear that it

00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,610
was always free software sometimes it

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,770
was open source and when I was young and

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:49,000
the world was new free software was

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,140
steadily less well defined than it is

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,240
nowadays I've been working on KDE for 17

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,030
years I guess and nowadays I work on

00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,310
Modest which is a system installer and

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,280
it's all systems if you have ever

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:08,220
installed anything other than the big

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:11,080
five Linux distros probably use commas

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,500
so we're going to talk about governance

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,390
and what government what's governance

00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,579
for governance is really about the risk

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:25,210
management as a free software projects

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm speaking to you all as free software

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,069
projects people I'm going to assume that

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,289
you've got some wonderful beats of free

00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:35,409
software that you want to polish the

00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:37,630
world bring into the world and you want

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:43,600
to keep it safe and that means you need

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:45,520
to do some basic management so maybe

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,799
this is going to be like business 101

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,450
and it's it might be very boring for you

00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:55,899
all because what kind of risks are we

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,920
looking at managing risks to your assets

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:01,479
the things you have and there's also

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,869
existential risks risks to your very

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:11,470
being which sounds much more dramatic

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:12,310
than it is but some of their risks that

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,880
need to be managed

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,160
I mean you're

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,660
going to be publishing stuff you're

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,890
gonna be holding events

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,220
and you're gonna be bringing people

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,340
together and things can go home

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,430
and when things go wrong you can do

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,130
things to things you trust that it will

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,730
all work out in the end or you can have

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:37,330
some kind of Darkness some kind of rules

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:40,990
to figure out what to do just ask all of

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:45,390
you in the audience who has read the

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,390
code of conduct for this conference

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:53,950
that's actually better than I expected

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,110
about a third of you that's good

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,110
he's a code of conduct for this

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:03,910
conference governs our behavior here and

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,830
that's a form of risk management I mean

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,670
if I do something terrible up here on

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:13,480
stage there's governance there's rules

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,880
and we can all all of you are empowered

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,950
to say the rules say that Adrienne

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,260
shouldn't have done that

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:26,770
and not that's important because that's

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,780
it takes away my ability to go it wasn't

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,570
that bad it takes away the organizers

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,890
ability to say that wasn't that bad and

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,770
so that's what governance isn't world

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:41,880
it's risk management I can't do the

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:45,060
terrible things that I want to do so

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,690
what kind of terrible things can happen

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,790
turtle things can happen here

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,520
we have a free software projects you're

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,130
interested in free software and the four

00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,940
freedoms are important to you so one of

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:01,550
the things you need to govern is the

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,500
doctor read the copyright on our source

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:07,640
code that's sort of your most important

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,370
thing and how do you do with governing

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,830
your source code you put a license on it

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,709
so what I'm gonna this is sort of that

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:19,910
the business 101 the free software

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:22,610
project 101 part of the talk in paper

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,910
license that actually expresses what you

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,800
feel what are moral or your business

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:32,110
objectives are for your free software

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,090
project because the license you pink

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:40,040
says a lot about how you want to be a

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:42,130
free software project I would advise you

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,600
to make one of the big 5 licenses

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,510
because they find licenses are well

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,540
understood people though most people

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,750
have a pretty good understanding of what

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:58,430
a big fine license means or my list of

00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:01,850
big five is CC zero which is yellow

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,150
doing something something useful to

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:08,080
closby is D which is do something useful

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:15,440
but keep it keep the headers intact

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:18,229
Apache License 42 which is have fun to

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,300
think about patents and the LGPL version

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,580
3 and the GPL version pick one of those

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,729
big five

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:29,360
whichever one best fits your your free

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,880
software project moral a stickler please

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,820
don't write any lessons please don't

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,140
take one of the obscure ones I mean

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:44,229
there's 80 odd licenses that the OSI

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,229
thinks are ok but it gets complicated

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,110
resource fair project and you're going

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:53,129
to hold copyrights and you've decided on

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,229
your license please decide on a

00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,979
contributor License Agreement or

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,439
fiduciary License Agreement or decide

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,560
that you don't want one frankly I'd

00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,330
advise you not to long write the Linux

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,189
kernel does fine without a copyright

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,719
assignment bit of paper it's a big

00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:16,229
complicated mess of copyrights and

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:20,189
that's fine but if you do want to have

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,199
CLA or NFL a decide early on because the

00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:29,759
earlier you decide the easier it is to

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:33,240
get it right a copyright a CLA tries to

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,909
assign copyright an SLA is something

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,300
that was pioneered I think by the Free

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:43,310
Software Foundation Europe and it does a

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:47,340
assignment take back of license rights

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,229
just much nicer and what's got the

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,759
license make sure everyone knows what it

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,650
is please PLEASE license put the lessons

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,909
and all of your header files or

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,529
everything that gets installed right so

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:05,520
that's sort of the license part of

00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:10,080
governance in in your free software

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,000
project aside from your source code

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,509
which is kind of a manageable regular

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,060
lives in in repositories somewhere it's

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,460
in a given repository or real of your

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,339
closet or whatever you like but you've

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,879
also got tangibles right you're a free

00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:30,539
software project you've got a domain and

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:33,419
you've got maybe you've got a trademark

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,060
maybe you've got a logo get those things

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,550
organized and somebody should own these

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,289
things right your domain has to be

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,779
registered but someone and I've seen it

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:50,129
half of the free software projects or

00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:52,500
other projects register domains by one

00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:54,330
of the contributors and then that later

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,220
becomes a problem because if I

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,100
contribute

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,100
contributor leaves along with the domain

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,800
and it really sucks if Katy don't work

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,210
for instance suddenly was used for

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,040
something else because the person

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,200
registering it by the way

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,340
so they can reposition the form and

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,190
there's there's a variety of

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:20,600
organizational forms available and use

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,130
that as early as possible there's an

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,990
organization in Europe called the

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,800
Collins Conservancy the Commons

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:32,900
Conservancy provides serve off-the-shelf

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:37,810
organizations if you as a free software

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:41,240
project need an organization so a

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,820
student and previously it spits out a

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,940
Dutch stick together which is an

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:51,080
organizational form you can use so

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,430
there's umbrella organizations that can

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,410
do these things for you you can also

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:58,730
join the KDE umbrella if you happen to

00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,680
like KDE make sure your organization is

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:06,200
socialized it should be part of your

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,600
complete community okay so those are

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:13,310
sort of two things you use your license

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,020
to to protect your things your source

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,720
code you use your organization to

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,900
protect the things you own write your

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,410
hardware your domains etc but then

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:28,880
there's certain existential threats

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,610
threats to the being the core being of

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,320
your software project as you need to

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,730
protect those as well and that's what

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,470
you need different kind of governance

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,860
for that's where you start working on

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,330
your processes

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm going to advise you to write down

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,080
your core values make sure that it's

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,150
really clear to all of your contributors

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,589
what you care about what is important

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,020
once you've got that right up with brand

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,960
up efficient as well if you can tell

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,780
people we want to reach that we want the

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,800
world to look like so you've got a

00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,490
better story

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:09,529
or potential contributors that if you've

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:12,560
got this wishy-washy you know we're

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,990
gonna make cool stuff I've recently been

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,790
told by people outside a start-up event

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,800
and they're like yeah it's really nice

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,450
to have projects that tell me where they

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,269
are going that give me a really long

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,360
road map because if they do I know

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,790
beforehand well how I can contribute

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,980
what I should contribute it makes it

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:37,279
easier for me as a driver i person to

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:40,130
give stuff to the project it's pretty

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,959
important actually also to tell people

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,180
how to get into your project and also

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:49,060
how to get out after all some people

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,350
will eventually leave so protect your

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,320
organization your free software project

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:58,089
by basically I'm telling you the great

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,519
documentation gosh that's really boring

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,959
I'm sorry yeah

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,209
if you rate this down if you make it

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,880
clear from the beginning you're free

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:10,360
software project will be stronger

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,980
because you've got this protection

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,170
against people coming in and not

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,850
understanding you you've already told

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:23,540
them that's long term stuff right these

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:26,180
are existential threats you want your

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,980
long-term goals to figure it out but

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,520
whenever you're doing things you know

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,440
just day-to-day you should also be

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,920
managing your day-to-day risks which is

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,380
what I call procedures I see procedures

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,839
as fairly short kind of things make sure

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,870
you have a code of conduct please if you

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,550
send them a free software project get

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,060
that close conduct figure it out as soon

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:53,600
as you possibly can

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,339
there's lots of different kinds of codes

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,350
of conduct a you make big ones little

00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:03,380
ones apart about a little bit more later

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:06,050
and anyone who is who was in Patricia's

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,040
talk has heard something about the

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,040
importance of cuz of

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,980
as create your free software project

00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,350
figure out a commuters guide as well

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,499
please tell people how they can best

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,959
contribute what the right mechanisms are

00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:26,449
and that procedures because nothing is

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,670
more frustrating for a potential

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:31,040
contributor than a show-up say I've got

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,769
this cool stuff and then nothing happens

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,100
if you were in Emma's talk about buck

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:39,439
try ash Gator can your triage figured

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,290
out quickly is love because every bug

00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:45,189
report is something that you need to

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,809
deal with and again for a book report

00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:50,269
having no response to a bug it's a

00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,040
really bad experience when interacted

00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,779
with a free software project so make

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,720
sure you go this manners guide to figure

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:59,949
it out get any fence guide as well right

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,720
you've got a nice event like this so

00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:06,170
false north is organized by the false

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,220
market organization that's yo.hannes job

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,019
it's your job sort of you've taken it

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,269
upon you at least before which I thank

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,939
you but if you're running a free

00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:20,180
software project then events are sort of

00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:22,550
incidental they're part of what makes

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,949
your project fun but it's not your core

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,199
business even so make sure you

00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:31,639
understand how events work because the

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:34,220
event can be really expensive it can be

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,899
expensive in terms of money simply

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,910
because you know if you don't figure

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,069
your budget out properly but that's an

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,680
offense can also be really expensive in

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,269
terms of PR and that's where reason to

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,819
come back to the code of conduct if

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:51,050
stuff goes wrong at an event it can blow

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:53,029
up in your face so they're writing about

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,480
but rather than having one your event

00:13:53,029 --> 00:14:00,129
events to be wrong you're already

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:05,929
managing the risks that feedback

00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:09,019
remember so I've given this fairly

00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,749
generic business one I want to talk

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:12,960
about get this stuff done figure it out

00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,920
as quickly as possible

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,450
when you're doing a free software

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,040
project because that's going to save

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,770
your butt later but there's also this

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,570
there's a couple of extremes I mean you

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,870
can even keep your government's really

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,089
lean and not write down a lot of stuff

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:34,940
and you can make your code of compact

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:38,730
speed be excellent not that's that's

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:42,410
lightweight easy to do and though then

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,750
you're serving this is wilderness of

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:48,959
wild confusion but there's a lot of

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,510
wiggle room and that sort of scrublands

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,279
that's no-one's explored and so you get

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,640
in this be good or being excellent

00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:01,920
wilderness is what I call it there's too

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,330
much too much under specified and wait

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,390
together end of the governance

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:10,640
experience there's this ISO 9002 swamp

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:12,570
you get totally bogged down in writing

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,410
breaking down everything that can go

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,880
wrong and everything that should be done

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,160
and I'm sorry I can't give you complete

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,990
advice but I'm telling you don't go to

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,810
the one extreme don't stay in the other

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:31,170
extreme please go looking for something

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,690
it's not place in the middle and those

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,820
one third of you who have read the code

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,930
of conduct for this conference you've

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:44,279
already seen that it says more than just

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:46,050
being excellent it says less than it

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,640
doesn't have this big long list of don't

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,260
do this to do that so it's it's

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,370
something that I like I kind of like to

00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:00,540
go to conduct so I've talked so far

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:03,839
about fairly generic things looking at

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:07,640
KDE in particular KDE is an old project

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,399
it is 21 years old that's old enough to

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:17,310
drive it's old enough to drink in most

00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:19,200
of the United States it's also old

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,990
enough to have learned some of these

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,870
things the hard way and Katie

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,410
definitely

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:28,930
do things the way I just told you to it

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,660
took many years to get all of these bits

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,240
and pieces of it out but it's not going

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,990
to pretend the kid he did this in the

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,860
way I told you to and it picks early on

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:45,760
the LGPL and the GPL as an expression of

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:48,430
its moral commitment to not only free

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,740
software but also to reciprocal free

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:54,700
software so it's sort of this original

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:57,100
moral position Katie he has picked an

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,300
optional fiduciary license agreement'

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,200
who worked together with the Free

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,980
Software Foundation Europe to make it

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,410
possible to for an individual

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,910
contributor to Katie to assign their

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:15,490
copyright like rights to be the

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,069
organization behind Katie and then

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,720
immediately get a complete license back

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:25,000
so that they can continue to exercise

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,679
almost all of their rights under

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,480
copyright why did we do that

00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:35,350
one of the things a fiduciary License

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:40,870
Agreement solves is the problem of sorry

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:44,440
death contributors will die at some

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,150
point and making sure that the

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,230
copyrights are well organized at that

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,410
point can help it certainly reduces your

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,090
administrative burden eventually and

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,870
knowing where your copyrights are coming

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:02,050
from is easier than the giant tangle

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,480
that is Linux but again that's not a

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:09,510
choice you can make and Katie has chosen

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,510
to make the Fla optional but encouraged

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:16,450
after a couple of years of people

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:19,030
building KDE in the late 90s the KDE

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:22,110
Association was created this is a German

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,549
Association why is it adjourn

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,110
Association building there's a lot of

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:33,120
the original contributors were Germans

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:35,700
this has its ups and down side german

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,370
association law is quite strong but it

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,919
also brings all kinds of administrative

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,669
burden so if you're going to be doing a

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,960
free software organization chalk around

00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,610
look for places that give you an

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,360
organization that is sufficiently

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:55,549
lightweight for what you want to do the

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,169
evey entire no matter the Association

00:18:55,549 --> 00:19:01,019
it's it's the organization that actually

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,690
owns the domains and trademarks of the

00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:07,470
materials we have if you buy a t-shirt

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:12,630
at our stand up front then you're buying

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:14,940
it from the EP the EP itself organizes

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:18,090
one conference per year with all of

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,159
Academy Academy contains a number of

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,659
administrative actions that have to

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:28,110
happen because rich on an association

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:32,070
and KETV itself also offers umbrella

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:35,700
services so we we don't only host and

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:38,700
support Katie be proper which is the

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,740
Katie frameworks development and plasma

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,470
development and the Katie applications

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,490
we also offer them turn an umbrella to

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:49,500
weekly to learn which is an Italian and

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:55,799
Italian an organization dedicated to

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:59,760
educational materials the way we offer

00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,169
those those umbrella services is when

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,919
people are interested in getting

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:07,919
lightweight organization and they

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,029
believe in our you know the rest of our

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,369
protection

00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:17,639
active moral choices Sookie my popular

00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:20,699
processes and procedures Katie the

00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:25,159
processes are fixed in the manifesto and

00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:27,389
division we spent I think two years

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,269
arguing back and forth long mailing

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:32,999
lists about the manifesto and the

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:35,309
manifesto is it's a lot like the

00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:38,159
Communist Manifesto it says a bunch of

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:41,939
things in very strong language this is

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,519
how it should be those are sort of our

00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:47,509
requirements for being part of our

00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:52,919
community but making that clear that

00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:56,699
helps anyone shows up I can subscribe by

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,519
your newsletter that's our TV vision we

00:20:56,699 --> 00:21:04,049
can actually rip it down where we want

00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,639
the world to go so that our processes

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:09,509
I'll show you those documents in a

00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:12,929
moment there's also a ktt code of

00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:15,809
conduct the code of conduct is actually

00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:19,529
looks a lot like the conference code we

00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:21,749
have here it is enforced by something

00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:25,499
called the community working group we

00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:28,949
have a couple of people that whose tasks

00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:31,019
within the KDE community is to make sure

00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:35,519
that the things work well and they also

00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:37,709
operate as trusted trusted parties if

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,449
there is a problem you go to the

00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:41,969
community working group because the

00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:44,939
community working group has the

00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:49,729
discretion but also the power to deal

00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:52,409
with interpersonal problems that show up

00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:56,639
if we look at the KTV manifesto for the

00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:58,379
minutes yeah this is really good

00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:59,819
we're a community of technologists

00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:01,769
designers writers and advocates who

00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,519
works in sure freedom for all people

00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:09,079
through our software okay probably the

00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,359
communist manifesto starts more literary

00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:17,520
or literary rules but this is at least

00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:18,830
our core value we're a community and so

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,590
saying this at the beginning we've gone

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:27,570
with guard to the rules that are being

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:32,540
govern our whole activity picked out in

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,540
be sick you know six points right here

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:39,050
we've got our vision also governs the

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,980
things we do with the things we

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:47,280
participate in so we're this is also be

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,290
able with we're looking for a world for

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,990
everyone where your digital life is

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:55,410
properly under your own control right

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,990
this helps us think and choose sort of

00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,030
what what kind of activities we do it it

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,940
reminds us also every now and that

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:05,580
remember producing software that will

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:09,150
spy on our users we go mm-hmm

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,130
that might not be the best idea spying

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,100
on our users is not compatible with our

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:17,160
vision so we should not create this

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,240
software which means that if you in

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,040
Sonic eight the desktop of Bill actually

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,400
it won't actively undermine your privacy

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,740
that's both about me

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,890
here's an overview of bikini code of

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:39,110
conducts and I probably resembles the

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:42,150
the one for this conference personally a

00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:45,450
bunch of stuff that'd be better in Katie

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:48,780
governance our Fla is view for an update

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,360
it hasn't but there's been some changes

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:56,250
in legal thinking which is why we need

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,050
to update it our onboarding story and

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,330
I've talked about that this morning is

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,990
you know when you get people need to

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:08,250
know better what what they're doing how

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:11,310
how their interaction is so our

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,170
onboarding stuff should be better the

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,490
code of conduct we have here action

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,330
offers a pheromone

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:20,220
I would personally like to reduce the

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:27,720
amount of rebuilding that's possible in

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:32,970
there I thought if we have time I've got

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:35,039
some examples of too much too little and

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,960
other than that in KDE I'm perfectly

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,360
willing to admit that a lot of our

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,330
engineering stuff could be better in

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,340
particularly MLS talks for me very

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,179
educational about how we should be

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:52,039
dealing with our own bugzilla so that

00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:56,820
sort of wraps up what else can say I

00:24:52,039 --> 00:25:00,240
have general governance advice caiis

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,419
governance roughly follows my own advice

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:22,649
but it could be better

00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:24,570
and if you have questions please maybe

00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:26,820
this is very specific about copyright

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,830
law but maybe you know or anyone else

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,759
though so what happens when a person

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,590
passes away where does the and there is

00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:43,740
no ceiling or anything like that who

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:49,909
doesn't belong be done so your copyright

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:53,580
in the European Union continental Europe

00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:56,340
doesn't have moral rights so we leave

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:59,070
that out of the way for the minute but

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:05,190
basically your copyright is an asset of

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:07,019
you and so the passes to your heirs at

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,929
the same time if you have published

00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:14,519
something under the GPL or whatever

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:17,070
license you've published it under that

00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,000
Alexis still applies because you've

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,160
conveyed the copy

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,350
videos and they've received that copy

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:31,030
honor the license so what can happen is

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,530
that your heirs decide to realign one of

00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,480
the things they could decide is to read

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,540
license your code under among free

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,790
license certainly if your heirs don't

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,300
understand software licensing that could

00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:45,970
happen but it doesn't actually affect

00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:48,940
anything because the code you've already

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,730
conveyed I mean you're dead you're not

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:56,650
making anymore code changes nobody

00:26:51,730 --> 00:27:05,740
commits to a github repo actually you

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:09,060
can probably set up if that's yeah let's

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:12,040
talk about we're deploying cases later

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:16,080
okay so it goes through here's short

00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,080
message short there's not a question

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:25,000
yeah you were talking about is it a

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:28,960
recruiting a foundation my bad point is

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,510
a project when do you think that you

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,750
should take a step from being just like

00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:38,890
eat a burrito and being institutional

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:42,370
assets legally because if I'm just one

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,830
developer I don't needa formation of

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,770
departments maybe two three people it's

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:51,580
more relevant when is this then when you

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:55,900
need to think was it is that problem too

00:27:51,580 --> 00:28:02,680
little I'm gonna give my favorite lawyer

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:05,170
the answer it depends as soon as you it

00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,420
looks like your project is going to need

00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,930
to be owning stuff you should be

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,930
thinking about

00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:17,169
so yeah almost as soon as people start

00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:20,440
you know as soon as you decide hey I

00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:23,590
need more than a vanity domain or hey

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,070
this project looks like it my last two

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,879
three years that's that's a point at

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:33,729
which you should start thinking about an

00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:36,969
organization that's really early I mean

00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:41,799
because most people are throwing stuff

00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:44,950
out there that's why it's something like

00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,129
the comments Conservancy exists in the

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,649
in North America the software freedom

00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:53,619
Conservancy that does something similar

00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:56,919
right so there's very lightweight ways

00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:57,429
of getting an organization off the

00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,219
ground

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:05,710
good so give it everything I do a

00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:08,229
lightweight I was a few advices the LPP

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,639
other the GPS that the problem in the

00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:13,799
early years when there was no question

00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:13,799
mark around the open for character cute

00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:25,029
it was never I stood for key because the

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:27,190
stuff we were making we we could license

00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:32,529
and we decided to license it under the

00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:36,149
LGPL and whether the resulting software

00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:40,139
could actually be legally distributed

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:43,389
was a problem that we've been years

00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:47,589
simply because cubes at the time we're

00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:49,479
talking about 1996 was under the qpl

00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:54,729
which wasn't an actual free software

00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:58,059
license but that hasn't been so back in

00:29:54,729 --> 00:30:02,909
1996 we said managers but that hasn't

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:06,419
been a problem since the first cute

00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:11,859
actual free software release which was

00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:14,139
an nd8 1989 so yeah sometimes you can

00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:16,499
even sometimes you can ignore the

00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:16,499
license

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,810
you have two more questions and I'm

00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,370
sorry for next week we're gonna steal

00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:26,770
like a couple minutes but since it's the

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:30,340
last one and I will get back to the

00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:33,640
wiggle room humanity about the code of

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,920
conduct us the project gets larger and

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,080
maybe more stakes involved in the

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,080
significance of the software increases

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,680
do you think the code of contacts should

00:30:41,080 --> 00:31:00,060
eventually become legally enforceable

00:30:43,680 --> 00:31:00,060
meaning that different language and

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:07,660
legally enforceable is is tough as well

00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:11,890
I mean because you know anyone can walk

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,810
in to this room I'd hate to have to sign

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:18,250
a waiver before attending this

00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:19,780
conference I'd hate to have to sign a

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:26,920
waiver before speaking at this

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:29,950
conference so I'd say no even that as

00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,590
the project grows bigger don't weigh it

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:35,250
down too much with with lawyerly stuff

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:43,630
remember there's only still the wall

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:48,840
it's still there so that's us you know

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,840
if if you're lucky the law has your back

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:56,410
fine this is a fun question a quick

00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:59,590
heckle bust all right the first thing

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:02,340
people you are I think the heckle is

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:07,620
that you saw me apply the BCC zero

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:11,039
as licensees OSI approved it is not so

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,809
yeah alright just a bit you know the

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,570
other person is more like a code of

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:18,120
conduct in focus so generally developers

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:21,240
are in public figures many parties they

00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:25,320
contribute to many communities projects

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,679
and things like this so one question is

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,529
that what do you do with someone who is

00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,880
obviously violating a code of conduct

00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:34,529
not necessarily yours

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,720
so what do you do about basically what

00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:41,610
do you do about bad behavior outside of

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,659
kte quiet a kneeler because their

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,960
offense could not have happened

00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:48,690
elsewhere

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:57,870
yeah so that's a very relevant question

00:32:48,690 --> 00:33:00,330
I mean it's you know I exist in the KDE

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:04,730
community but I also have my own Twitter

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:07,740
handle and I could claim that my Twitter

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:09,750
happens outside the KDE community and

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,320
that would be an example

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:18,740
I think we're fortunate enough to the

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:22,529
not encountered this yet but I

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:25,970
personally believe so this is a policy

00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:29,669
of the project I personally believe that

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,740
yeah if you're showing bad behavior in

00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:35,669
another online community or a similar

00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,710
community that should that should be

00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:43,880
taken very seriously as if it is a code

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:43,880
of conduct violation I'm hesitant to

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:52,669
drag too much of people's real physical
