Title: Speculo: shared memory made easy - Alberto Mardegan
Publication date: 2018-04-24
Playlist: foss-north 2018
Description: 
	How you can implement a lockless inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism on top of shared memory and nothing else. The talk will cover the details of how the speculo library handles its shared memory areas and how a stream of messages can be implemented on shared memory. Despite being low-level, the session does not require knowledge of algorithms or a strong background on IPC.
The talk might touch some philosophical considerations about the evolution of software solutions.
