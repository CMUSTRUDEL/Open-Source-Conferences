Description: 
	Sailfish X is a downloadable version of the Sailfish OS for Xperia mobile phones. This speech presents how Jolla, a small company from Finland, created the OS, and the downloadable Sailfish X in collaboration with Sailfish community and partners.

Sailfish 3 is the latest generation of the Sailfish OS. Sailfish 3 brings updates to many core components of the OS like Qt and Android app support. Sailfish 3 supports new device categories including wearables and feature phones, and the OS gains many improvements for security and corporate features.

all right so hi everyone welcome my name

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,920
is James Murray

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,890
and I will be teaching you some history

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,020
today so that's not a joke I'm actually

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,320
gonna talk about your lost history

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:41,600
so I'm the community manager of Yola

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:43,670
it's a a company based in Finland and

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,050
everyone here to hear yourself through

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:51,890
those any now it's a company based in

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:55,400
Finland and pickup incorporated in 2011

00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:01,909
so the first product hit the market

00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:06,560
during 2013 2013 and so what we do is

00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:11,119
that we we do mobile we have sailfish OS

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,240
which is our basically general I would

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,140
say and we develop sailfish sailfish OS

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,340
score for the world it is the only

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:24,410
independent overall operating system in

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:27,230
the world currently so we started in

00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,380
2013 by bringing legal of phone into the

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:34,340
market and the reason was that we kind

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:38,060
of were forced to become our own OPM or

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:42,110
vendor let's say because no one will

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,330
take a new be operating system seriously

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,640
no not the big vendor will take it

00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,520
seriously so we have to just implement

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,430
everything in hardware and bring some

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,880
innovation into the market using our own

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,400
power

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,530
however we could although I'd say be I

00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,630
wasn't a part of the company back then I

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:05,950
was just a community member but still it

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:08,989
still counts and we the company itself

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,230
first was founded on the kitchen table

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:16,230
of one of the co-founders then actually

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:19,770
is is referred to the talks in the

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,690
I wasn't there currently we have 50

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,519
employees and most of them are are of

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:29,420
course from former Nokia teams we have

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,580
of course it was in Tampere Finland that

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,690
the company started Tama force if you're

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,060
from Sweden

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,890
they were named differently so the first

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,440
office the first official office of the

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,260
company was in Tampere Finland and then

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,470
that we have currently office a paper at

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:54,569
one company a stinky and at the same

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:59,099
time the the people who are working on

00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:00,870
the Michael and Vito operating systems

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,380
from Nokia which variants based

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,760
operating systems moves over to your

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:11,370
Lobby most of them move over to your

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,970
basically continues the legacy of Minko

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,130
and rots in officials to the world so

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,980
far we have 75 million u.s. dollars

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,410
invested on to selfishness and that's

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,380
basically I can say it's not a lot of

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,510
money for a full operating system if you

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,450
think about like what a company as they

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,980
go through to productize an operating

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,660
system are basically bringing it up to

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,840
up to the standards of the world with

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,910
our new strategy we have we have three

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,340
licensees regional licensees now in in

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,489
Russia China Latin America's we are

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,170
expanding of course so I don't know

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,850
matching the details about that strategy

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,340
presence is a little bit thicker but

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,840
this is actual action of the front

00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,970
accurate we have 10,000 plus

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
international in the articles written

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,109
about are the involve a source in

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,810
efficient of both or it's just a cool

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:12,750
cool thing to know for me as well now

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,750
how do we do is like how powerful 50

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,669
people bring an apprentice and mobile

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,799
operating system to the world that's not

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,680
what is done is actually

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,360
or if you think about it but it's the

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,699
community and it's the heart of the Ola

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,259
we have said that from the beginning but

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,610
where did this community come from it

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,860
was from the nokia days of course

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,199
because there wasn't like we all didn't

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,270
exist and what we knew about yet when we

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,129
but this is where we started the company

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,379
of course nobody would not want us

00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,710
either because how would we pick up I

00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:50,340
mean between all the Samsung and Apple

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:54,360
whatever how a company made out of a few

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,800
people pick up mini articles it would

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,500
not work and nobody would know about us

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,270
so it was the community from the

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,560
Pinocchio days that that has moved over

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,810
to your outside with the employees and

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,360
that continued the journey with us and

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,090
now it's even bigger than before it's

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,919
even more awesome than before of course

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,990
the community manager would say that I

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:22,199
do want to keep my job after all so it's

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,719
really it would be able to do any of

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,550
this without the community so what would

00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:30,569
the community do what does the community

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,409
do for us its media coverage of course

00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,940
there are different blogs in different

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,940
languages in different parts of the

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,819
world that frequently write about us and

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,419
the news acronym of of the company of

00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,400
course the authors of those blogs are

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,529
community members and they have direct

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,050
contact with me most of the time and

00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:54,659
they they know what's going to happen

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,210
and what is happening already and we we

00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:01,830
have the word of mouth so when you don't

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,960
have billions of dollars to put on your

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,110
marketing budgets like other companies

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,800
do you basically have no chance of

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,050
surviving

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,300
in the same area like if a convex

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,000
goodness $1,000,000 and you're putting a

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,659
few thousand even to tens of thousands

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,539
you know basically no chance so you use

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:24,180
a free service called word of mouth and

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,240
that's basically what happens with the

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,000
kindness of our community most of them

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,199
are ellipse enthusiasts their friends

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,620
and family they know who they are they

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,360
know what they talk about so so it's not

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,090
strange when they go to their family and

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,800
they or friends or whoever and I stop

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,180
talking about hey look at school phone I

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,909
have again this cool operating system

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,219
whatever it's really fine and people

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:51,509
listen to them and get to know what

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:54,599
you're not selfish is it goes for more

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,389
like that of course they they help us in

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,009
social activities like an example that

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,400
happened recently we were in mobile

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,669
progress every year there a couple of

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,080
community members on a couple maybe

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:09,449
follow us there they helped us with the

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,360
demos I myself was a community member at

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:15,000
some points before I got high I followed

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,029
to these events and helped out showing

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,710
devices to people and letting them know

00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,620
what your unselfish is about bringing

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,569
opinion to the booth basically

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,479
introducing them to the engineers so

00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:30,779
that they could get deep into the their

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,610
goal of salvation and word as I

00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,599
mentioned already general awesomeness is

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:40,650
there is the community's biggest asset

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,180
here if I will go into more details in

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,150
what the community actually does for us

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,779
in terms of their contribution not the

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,370
media coverage and stuff we should start

00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,469
with there with the community testing so

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,969
we have different groups that receive

00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:58,620
release candidates for different

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,210
releases of our operating system

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,509
practice of our operating system and

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,620
they may catch the stuff that we may

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:09,530
have missed the report boards

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,080
they do different testing scenarios for

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,330
us on everything use Excel basically

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,490
it's it's possible we're only 50 people

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,550
that we don't have those 50 people not

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,830
everybody is a tester so you definitely

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,080
can reach something and the community

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,580
definitely helps us a lot with that with

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,980
that we have four tiers so we do have a

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,810
modernization team but again out of that

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,720
50 people and I'll mention that again

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:38,000
it's a little bit redundant but our 50

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,090
people we had a small team of hardware

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,070
lactation team those that they don't

00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,370
have the time or resources or anything -

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,350
just get 50 devices in hand to start

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,720
porting selfish events - that doesn't

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,990
work like that so again the community

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,860
comes in they get a device maybe they

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,140
have an old device lying around or

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,610
something in that regards and they just

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,350
support selfish of us to it of course

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,340
it's not going to have all the features

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:10,700
but that's not that's not the case the

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:13,850
case the point here is that they pour

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,190
selfishness and if you as a person who

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,050
don't know what selfish services who

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,000
hasn't tested it before if you have on

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,950
fooling around you can maybe Google your

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,500
phone model and see if they come if

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,410
there is a community poor for it or not

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,390
and there's freely just install and test

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:35,920
and see if selfishness is for you or not

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:37,930
it's it's amazing and we of course has

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,820
translation

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,110
translations happening so so we have

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,330
community members of course from

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,270
different parts of the world they don't

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,470
different languages so we have a pool

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,970
and we put the operating system strings

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,550
for live updates that are coming all

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,890
those that Moodle and everybody just

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,720
comes there translating everything to

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,660
their own language and these it's just

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,020
it's so fast so intuitive and amazing

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,300
that I don't know like if I love the

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,220
community

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,300
then of course we have applications and

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,360
we have over 4,000 applications

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,860
currently on our store of course if you

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,600
compare it to the to the big fingers

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,800
it's not that much but then again you

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,220
have to imagine our level of involvement

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,050
with people how many people I should use

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,930
our operating system great compared to

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,240
to those so thousand apps who over

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,399
thousand hours actually that's really

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,230
impressive and also we have things only

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,569
on our official store then there's

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,029
another store driven by the community is

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:45,269
called open repose of the repositories

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:47,250
and repository of applications that are

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,589
written by the community that are not on

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,569
the store maybe they're coming later on

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,360
the store but anyway you can go download

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,490
over there I don't have an exact number

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,100
for that but those are quite a lot too

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,470
because open repos is actually older

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,769
than you are selfie was it was a

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,019
repository for for Nokia one Mamiko

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,680
applications but nowadays is being used

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:13,620
for for selfish and then of course we

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,480
have different various various open

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,699
source contributions on our mayor and

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:24,000
sailfish OS and of course source

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:28,230
projects based on that as well then we

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,819
have this forum type website called 300

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,430
pound that is also of course we are we

00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:38,240
are available there we read with respond

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,829
etc but it's mostly community driven a

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,309
lot of people help each other over there

00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:47,009
and one solution to the potential

00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:52,709
problems that they have and which is

00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:54,079
also very now we go back a little bit to

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:57,809
what happened

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,089
viola what why not just you know we'll

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:02,329
continue with the Nokia

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:08,869
as you can see these pictures actually

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:12,019
from chocolate some people so there was

00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:14,599
this me know and mine when I talk about

00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,819
so this Mego was called was doubt the

00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:18,859
burning platform you know here for some

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:22,309
reason a lot of people found it

00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:27,919
unreasonable but me he got killed off

00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:29,509
and and jana novotná and in case you

00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,699
live in sweden you know swedish is the

00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:35,209
same word as your neck which is a

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:39,139
smaller boat that it kind of rescues you

00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:41,749
from such a situation and if i go to the

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:46,729
next slide by very poor photoshop skills

00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:48,289
I have I mean it's right there it's

00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:51,109
running away and it's not even the right

00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:53,089
boat it should be a very small smaller

00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:58,099
but I couldn't find a PNG that I could

00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:00,619
work there so I'm sorry yeah dingy yes

00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:03,679
yes thank you

00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:06,199
so yeah they there should be people in

00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:09,829
there and they use that that did you do

00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:13,069
to run away from there from the fire and

00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:16,339
they basically made this company so why

00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:18,529
else are native OS that's an important

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,859
question because if you pocket I get

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:25,879
asked all the time why would I use it we

00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:27,259
show us and this this previous presenter

00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,879
I forgot her name sorry but she was

00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,189
saying who are gonna use for problems

00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,449
people are asking here the same thing

00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:34,189
why would I you selfish choice with this

00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:38,469
Android vendors offer but there is the

00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:42,249
iOS operating systems well first of all

00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:45,589
we are on a different philosophy of

00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:48,099
operating systems are to say so I'm

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:52,339
going to bring up an example of course

00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:54,140
imagine if the whole world was having

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,930
just one core rather than that was

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,730
for it was only Mercedes that would not

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,190
be fun with it there was no competition

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,440
there was no I mean they use the same

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,690
combustion engine or maybe an extra file

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,650
or really hybrid where they use the same

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,210
systems they get you from A to B but the

00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,030
different brands you like them for what

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,640
they are and this is basic the same

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:20,600
story but we are bringing a different

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,970
philosophy here we our biggest selling

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,780
point here is that we don't collect or

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,140
cellular data and that's very important

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:34,100
because Android for example is based on

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,860
I mean is is alive on collecting and

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,070
sending your data they monetize whatever

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,070
you have on your phone and a lot of

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:47,720
people don't want that and we respect

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:49,880
that and we don't want that so we agreed

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,950
this into the market we promise you that

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,030
we don't collect any data the only thing

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,520
that we want from you is your email

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,230
address clearly a lockouts and you you

00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,350
may just give us any of Liam analyst

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:04,220
that theory and care not so it's fine

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,310
we don't need any data from you then the

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,020
other aspect is a different use a more

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,320
modern user interface and user

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:16,070
experience so the UX philosophy behind

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,750
Yola and sailfish OS is is that what

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,210
power we designed the operating system

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,250
here is that we you don't need to move

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,220
your thumb damage from the screen I

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:30,170
should maybe actually cooperate it isn't

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,850
much better like that there we go so you

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,190
don't need to

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:36,220
it'll be to move your thumb from this

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,650
corner of the screen that much because

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,660
everything can be done by gestures so

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,190
you'll be are inside an application you

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,800
want to I'm not sure if anybody can see

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,420
this but anyway you want to move to the

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,010
back to home screen just select the

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,600
application away you want to go to the

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,269
after we just swipe upwards

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,180
that you want to go to notification just

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:58,810
swipe this way everything is based on

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,949
gestures you wanna I don't know grab

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,959
find out about the options that are not

00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:04,610
in the application you see there's a

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,410
line up there and you just swipe

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,490
downwards and you see the options you

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,990
don't even have to click on it just

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:14,600
release your finger and instead it's

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:17,389
full by haptic feedback so even like

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,170
thinking about it health-wise your thumb

00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:23,120
will be done here it's important you

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,089
have to is very important

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,699
try try working with a tablet Android

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:33,170
tablet pure sample heard after two hours

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:38,509
and that's it it not good for a lot of

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:42,230
doctors the stuff exciting that that's

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:45,860
not a big differentiator here and of

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:48,889
course it's we will try to challenge the

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,199
handle situation it's not good to have a

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:54,350
duopoly of operating systems as I

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,850
mentioned in the beginning as well now

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,399
the path of sailfish OS so then again

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,660
I'm repeating myself here but since I'm

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,490
transitioning to rescue after this slide

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:10,789
I need to remind you about set so it

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:16,010
start from Mohammed Nokia they were so

00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:19,189
Mego was and joint joint forces between

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,079
Intel and Nokia and they put a lot of

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:22,699
resources and a lot of money

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,520
I mean it's Intel and smokey the two

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:29,870
huge companies April are racers a lot of

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,140
money a lot of investments into the

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,990
operating system they developed it and

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:42,230
they just abandoned it for whatever

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:46,610
reason then people who saw the potential

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:48,620
that was within that operating system

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,140
continue the legacy of it brought this

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,919
sailfish OS 1.0 which was which started

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,290
a sailfish was paid into the market on

00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:01,270
those devices and

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:03,670
illah tablets and then we changed our

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,320
strategy to sell television when we

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,680
released example shows 2.0 we changed

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,080
our strategy we we start assessing the

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,000
software the different vendors and we

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,780
had a we have different members in India

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,250
and other countries that in some sense

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,450
we saw as pre-install cell features on

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:26,020
the devices now we have selfish 3 and

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,810
also safety checks which you will hear

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:32,710
about later of course and also we have

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,820
the strategy of regional ecosystems that

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,130
I talked about a little bit at the

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,770
beginning so we are making the current

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,930
system available regionally through we

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,630
based on what your country needs based

00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,550
on the needs of those people we

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,560
releasing it into your country level as

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,970
I said for example that was China and

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:55,570
Russia and South America Latin America

00:18:50,970 --> 00:19:00,090
so the part I am now going to transition

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:04,060
to this book and in order to continue

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,670
all right so as we started out with the

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,070
regional licensing strategy we had a

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,500
challenge and the challenge was rough

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,490
without there are wrong devices

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:20,680
available for our community the original

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:25,840
devices we eat was back in 2013 2015

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:28,330
they were aging the licenses that we had

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,820
those devices were available in some

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,520
markets but not in the markets where our

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,210
community mostly was as we are a

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,640
European based company of course most of

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,670
the communities in Europe even though

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,340
there are significant community parts

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:48,100
elsewhere but this fact the whole

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:54,430
community was without up-to-date

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:57,070
hardware so people to provide an answer

00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:00,520
to that question that how community get

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,610
an up-to-date hardware and same is

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,940
always on that hardware with reasonable

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,940
price and reasonable results and

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,179
ever since we did not want to go back to

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:16,509
making our own devices making our own

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:20,590
devices is we have seen it's very very

00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:23,349
costly it's very very risky and we had

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,259
our ups and downs and we come time to

00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:30,789
find this regional licensing strategy

00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:37,840
that is able to pull enough money to the

00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:40,479
company's income so we chose this

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,029
approach that lets develop an

00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:46,210
aftermarket operating system for an

00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:49,059
existing device so basically you go to

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:54,070
the shop buy a device and then you will

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:56,979
be able to flash selfies on it this

00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:00,609
removes the cost of developing the

00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:03,460
hardware is removes the risk in the

00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:06,190
hardware development project we just

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:09,279
need to do the important work of the

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:12,609
operating system we need to have a some

00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,580
way of providing the image for the users

00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:19,359
so developer shop then we need to

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:24,129
provide instant instructions and ideally

00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:27,039
make the install as easy as possible for

00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:29,889
the vendor we need to have a vendor that

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,099
supports discount activity of course

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:36,570
most phone manufacturers would like to

00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:39,399
use their operating system as is and

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,879
that's a problem there are a couple of

00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:45,999
nice ones that allow unlocking the

00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:48,879
bootloader and hacking custom Android on

00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:50,919
it and that's also a way for and

00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:56,529
ultimately we always like safe is always

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:58,989
on to the device and then thirdly we

00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:03,070
already saw the value of the community

00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:04,840
in change this part is huge and of

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,669
course in this activity we wanted to

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,239
work with the community as much as

00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:12,970
possible it makes the possibility of

00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:14,570
success much higher and worse then when

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,059
you be involve in devil

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:23,659
you're much more committed to actually

00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:27,230
getting the divisor the product is

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,130
called saying is X this is the marketing

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:34,360
slide for it

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:37,340
so we put it for the xperia x the

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:43,519
operating system first I made it

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:45,830
available last year and how it works is

00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:50,029
that that the slack is three-way

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:53,269
collaboration going on so firstly Sony

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:56,539
has a program called open devices

00:22:53,269 --> 00:23:01,899
program where they have a set of their

00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:04,519
devices supported they have the

00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:07,269
instructions for the users to unlock the

00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:10,399
bootloader in a controlled manner you

00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:13,639
company to access certain search terms

00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:16,360
and services and be aware of practical

00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:18,980
implications because it's no no longer

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,399
product after you one of the bootloader

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:26,450
and install a custom always with an

00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:29,809
distantly sony also releases an Android

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:33,019
Open Source project based image for

00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:35,120
these devices so there is a working

00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:39,799
baseline Android wear we know that piece

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:43,100
and that feature is working then we have

00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:48,500
a community around IO

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:51,139
of course it's a minute cute it's pretty

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,080
much technically record white normal

00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:56,509
Linux distribution except that it's for

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,659
a mobile phone and then has this a

00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:01,730
dastardly UI

00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:05,259
under me there's asked the company to

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:08,210
making it productized having it tested

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:11,960
making sure that this and that feature

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,650
works and some of the parts that we have

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:23,130
licensed phone

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:27,000
parties that those are available so we

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,830
started is we announced it in 2017 at

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,590
Mobile World Conference where we have

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:39,120
the first demo of running on the Xperia

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:42,300
extract all ready for that first demo we

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,610
have hand-picked a couple of community

00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:48,960
members that we knew from the hardware

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:50,400
updates of community that take a look we

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,460
have this kind of activity going do you

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,700
want to help us in making a port for the

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,700
Xperia x2 ice the guys were really

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,700
really enthusiastic I mean we had one of

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,070
those company wisely our Airbnb during

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,280
the conference fixing box last night

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,590
like until early in the morning to make

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,240
the demo something that the hundred

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,820
thousand attendees of Mobile World

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:20,940
Conference can actually have in their

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:23,540
hands YouTube videos and everything that

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,490
was interesting stuff for the project

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:30,780
then during the summer beat started to

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:34,990
matter is the actual port setting up a

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,920
shop and a way to actually deploy

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,170
[Music]

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,390
distribute the limits what was one of

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:46,740
the challenges that also took a little

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,220
bit longer than we anticipated baby be

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,590
hired

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,929
the community garden was helping us is

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,740
he turned out to be such an awesome

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:59,580
awesome time and he did a lot the

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:05,040
trickiest are they supportive of the

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:07,679
whole porting process then also we

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,710
attack what we also opened the hardware

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,480
facing sources and was a little bit

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,000
trickier than we thought so when you

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,820
start on some track it's always

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,090
difficult in to meet project to change

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:24,060
because that's many people contributing

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,560
what you always feel that you are in

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,840
that critical moment that hey we are

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,950
shipping next week or next next week

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,710
let's not make anything big changes but

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,990
your immediate in the soccer getting

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,210
more more possible differently community

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:43,830
and also that helped the community

00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:46,320
members to make ports to relay it device

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,140
it's not the exactly xperia x so there

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,300
is today X compact which is a quite

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,030
clear quite near

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,760
and there's the dual-sim version is also

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,800
quite near so those of those projects

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:04,050
started already very to start they're

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:06,690
less resources then finally in October

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:11,160
after the final push you were able to

00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:14,280
start the Saints have everything in

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:19,290
place so the always working the shuttles

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,630
available it starts toxins were what's

00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:36,990
the right word for it well we have it's

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:39,980
done instructions provide software

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,930
updates is somehow in our DNA so

00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:46,530
November was the first software update

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:51,360
for for for this one it was some bug

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:54,570
fixes mainly then in this year we we

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,070
demonstrated the follow-up device so

00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,440
this is a Xperia x8 and it's a good

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,190
model for me so it was announced just

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,880
January and then we had the the safest

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,670
booting up at conference already and we

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,650
will be providing this to market well

00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:19,170
basically as you must be having training

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:22,410
then we did our second software update

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,940
now March and we are working on the

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:29,760
third update which we are providing

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,050
hopefully in May and then we will free

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,600
support for dual-sim warrior

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,890
the device we have enabled the

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,570
fingerprint part of the device and

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,850
finally we want to make the install a

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,580
bit more easier by having a graphical

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:49,120
installation wizard it's still going to

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,790
have several steps because of the way

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,970
you unlock the bootloader and do this

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,920
and that but the reception be fighting

00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:03,940
you much better than just a website

00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:07,270
instructors so in practice how it works

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:11,170
for a user you can find experience from

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:14,980
any shop now you go to the Sony website

00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:17,170
for the unlocking structures they will

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,010
give you a lacque device specific unlock

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:23,350
code which you need to use certain tool

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:28,180
to enable to the device in the pool

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:30,610
owners and then you can purchase the

00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,060
service always come home it and then

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,800
flash the device so if you know what you

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,800
are doing you have your half an hour you

00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,970
are down but unfortunately for most it

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,460
might take a little bit more than that

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:47,950
and what was cool is that Linux was the

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:56,190
easiest one to do it and Windows was the

00:29:47,950 --> 00:30:00,880
most difficult how did we succeed

00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:06,970
well effort required was about half of

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:09,730
our usual porting pro 14 efforts and

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,440
there's of course like a couple of

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,740
things that contribute this one

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,720
firstly the community involvement help

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:22,240
helped us a lot and then we were

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,270
realistic in a target setting so we need

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:30,250
something that that sounds kind of a bad

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:32,350
but we did so for example Bluetooth it

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,050
said that they will not people don't in

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,640
the beginning that was not officially

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:40,990
supported some feet

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,840
we're already on the first release but

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:48,350
it's much easier when you you don't like

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,540
some specific level of compatibility

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:52,250
users say that no it's not your pocket

00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,210
then it's a positive surprise of your

00:30:52,250 --> 00:31:02,920
has three works instead of negative that

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:08,450
your car so we love those hard choices

00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:13,400
which miss also explain how it was so

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:16,280
significantly lower than usual we also

00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,830
met the sales targets and again there we

00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,950
wanted to be realistic as well that this

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:26,090
release is really for the safest hope

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:27,860
boosts the lives people the open source

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:32,030
people a lot of people that are

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,520
technically very capable and has the

00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:37,700
patience to do something a little bit

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,400
scary and a little bit tricky but that

00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,460
still I think we reach the group quite

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,559
well we have got the nice public

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,919
feedback you can see the couple of

00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:53,600
tweets here on screens of three also

00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,580
read a bonus in addition to two

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,520
individuals we have had couple of

00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,490
journalists describing the release and

00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,419
read the nice articles about the

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:08,210
situation reporting both good and bad

00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:10,280
but honestly even the the biggest

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,710
technology magazine in Finland called

00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,200
technical model had an article about it

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,150
and they complained about the install

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,450
process but other than that the feedback

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:26,270
area and of course there's this

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:28,070
additional benefit of having a device

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,610
that is so easily available

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,160
from the mass market vendor that when we

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,930
have these business-to-business

00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,300
discussions we can always save those

00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,490
companies that are interested if you

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,320
want easy way to try over by these

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,460
follow these instructions and you have

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,920
device on your hands

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,910
we don't need to ship any prototypes we

00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,970
don't need to rely on video conferences

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:58,160
or Facebook's or expensive travels for

00:32:52,970 --> 00:33:01,070
these first experiences so in fact this

00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,860
has been such a positive program that we

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,050
are following up I hope you'll be the XA

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,760
2 device so we will follow up with

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:14,150
that's largely based on you know how

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:20,900
successful the first Xperia experience

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:25,670
has been for us so what did we learn

00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:28,850
well open-source collaborative partners

00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:32,630
are vital so the Sony Open devices

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:36,410
program provided technically very good

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:38,870
baseline for our efforts and in addition

00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:41,360
we have some black talks with the

00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,550
engineers involved in that program and

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,070
they were you know happy to help us and

00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:49,520
so you know decent that technical

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:52,550
challenges so that that's that's

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,190
something that was definitely needed for

00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,280
this I'm working with other vendors who

00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,680
have been much much more difficult

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,290
similarly the target setting did need to

00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,900
be very realistic that we cannot just

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:08,380
say that everything from day one will

00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,060
instead we give keeping the features in

00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,050
the bank's good for us like the

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,380
fingerprints

00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:17,750
coming now in the next month and if you

00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,940
if you have been as patient as a user

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:26,330
you will get click these little treats

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:29,679
as a software update the community has

00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:33,440
been a huge value all away through the

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,350
program then there have been some

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,540
challenges I've already mentioned about

00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,940
the hardware updates and shorts instance

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,400
it will be tricky to change it in the

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,830
meet project to product I said well

00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,260
enough to open it up but I don't think

00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:53,170
the exit you will be able to do it much

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:57,230
much quicker we had some last week

00:34:53,170 --> 00:35:00,860
changes so for example we did the

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:04,070
installation method me I think two weeks

00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:07,490
before the shop opened without that only

00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:10,100
way we can install image one week before

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:13,550
we do that only way we can install his

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,890
windows and then during you know last

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,990
day we understood that we can support

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:24,320
Windows Mac and Linux which was our

00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:26,750
target from the beginning keeping focus

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,670
in delivering what was promised I think

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:34,070
this isn't any any question but it's my

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:37,520
screen like this that it's easy to go do

00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:39,050
the nice and easy things but you to pay

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,590
attention that would help you actually

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:46,870
promised to ship because keeping the

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:50,150
promise is really what matters and

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:53,560
sometimes it's too fun we have paid

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:57,740
customer projects so customer pays us

00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:00,380
fix this improve this implement this and

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,080
then we have this nice our own device

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,580
our community love these devices so as

00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,580
an engineer which do you prefer

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,039
[Applause]

00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:15,799
perhaps a little bit too much spy but

00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:19,630
I'm still quite happy that I mean we

00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:23,930
have made like being able to balance the

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:25,789
internal former project with the

00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:31,160
customer project that pays the daily

00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:32,299
business alright so that was to say

00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,400
physics

00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:39,680
it's been fun so far the next step is

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,769
st. is free so this is what we work on

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,219
this year is the latest version of the

00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:52,940
same operating system it will bring us

00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:55,880
new form factors new UX fixes more

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:02,569
security and promise what do you see

00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:09,109
here is is the XA 2 then you see demo of

00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:13,039
the feature home so this is a proof of

00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:17,059
how the UI scales from tablets to

00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:22,299
smartphones to feature phones and we

00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:25,519
even had a SmartWatch demo last year and

00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:28,190
then we have this landscape device this

00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,619
is a typically PDA PDA

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:36,130
ruddiness a nice demo here so we have a

00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:36,130
2 port for full QWERTY landscape device

00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:46,279
under the hood it's a lot of things are

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,759
related to the technology how we built

00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:53,719
this so what we do is update some key

00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:56,180
components on the stack cute is what we

00:37:53,719 --> 00:38:00,589
used for the UI development and we are

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:03,499
going to upgrade it to 5.9 it's a long

00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:05,479
term Patrice that's why we prefer it

00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:10,160
over the new your father

00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:13,630
10 then we are going to operate the

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,830
Android support person so we have a

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:21,870
sandbox for

00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:26,840
on the OS but it has been based on 4.4.4

00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:31,980
so quite ancient hundred base 1 or API

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:34,680
we are upgrading it this year and from

00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,860
these software up crates mostly from the

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,390
cute upgrade and the improvements in

00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,630
Cuba we are going to get some

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:45,750
performance improvement let me have a

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,790
bottle you api's a lot of those come

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,310
from the queue detail but then there are

00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,080
some suits some abs that we have

00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:57,290
developed for privacy and security

00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:02,700
related to maybe in a few libraries and

00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:05,250
secrets then the point of integration is

00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,500
improving so our approach to block is

00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,930
this webchange say that we don't collect

00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,740
your data we are not hosting any in a

00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:16,850
cloud but but we have plug-ins for

00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:24,390
various popular 12 providers like

00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:26,910
Dropbox one cloud and others and we are

00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,280
going to just build in system

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:32,340
functionality to synchronize your info

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,490
to those clods and it's going to be

00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:40,320
blocking paste so that if you can write

00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:43,880
your own plot plug-in then we are happy

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,880
to synchronize to your valve as well

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:51,180
security we are working more and more

00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:54,950
with corporate and government market so

00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,420
having encrypted data and communications

00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,540
things like device management for

00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,390
corporations like remote lock and wipe

00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:10,110
these kind of things on the security

00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:12,000
area and then of the connectivity what

00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:18,300
slack up-to-date connectivity matters

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:20,580
like a multi brutally USB on-the-go well

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,089
the user experience we are going to have

00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,569
a couple of the improve

00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:30,079
the core you accept are of the requested

00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:36,920
and we believe that makes the Chester

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:40,369
vest you makes even more happy assure we

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,279
also have the new diverse categories the

00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:51,589
feature phone the the landscape where

00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:55,940
people and low spec hardware the the

00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:59,180
gestures are mostly around improving the

00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:02,499
movie does to experience like they have

00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,809
the way to quickly switch between apps

00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:09,349
the top menu redesign so that it's

00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:13,849
easier to access the shortcuts for for

00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:17,229
settings that are mostly used and then

00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:19,969
lastly we have to do visual style so

00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:22,910
we're calling in inverted ambience at

00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:26,210
the moment but the idea is that the UI

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:29,180
has been a white text on a dark

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:32,599
background that's not very good in the

00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:36,619
direct sunlight or sunny some in summer

00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:38,900
days so you then have this inverse

00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:48,109
inverted ambience where you have a black

00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:50,630
takes white background and one of the

00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:53,359
biggest changes really is this support

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,969
for the feature phones so we have

00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,079
happened to the keypad navigation for

00:41:55,969 --> 00:42:04,130
the UI the concept of safety service

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:07,130
have been quite nicely on the keypad of

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,829
course we need to probe some features we

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,299
need to drop things like multitasking

00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:13,999
well that of course you are running out

00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:18,650
of memory you can multitask and if you

00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:21,109
want to reach even further down down the

00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,839
memory budget so you might need to probe

00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:26,509
the problem as well but if you have just

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,749
a little bit of memory and just enough

00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:32,450
then you can also run selected Android

00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:36,319
apps maybe order to all your feature

00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:39,289
phone like what's up so you can navigate

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:46,219
it to keep an adjusted on your feature

00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:49,249
phone so that's what I have to say about

00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:51,829
save is free we are here we have a stand

00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:54,019
there so if you want to touch our

00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:57,799
devices to see the feature phone demo

00:42:54,019 --> 00:43:03,019
just come and visit us on our stand and

00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:06,640
we have some swag as well what else oh

00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:10,339
yeah we have a completely meet up today

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:14,109
seventeen seventeen thirty others some

00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:14,109
place to talk to us

00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,469
[Music]

00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:28,650
I hope you are also doing weight falls

00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,650
and swag so do we have any questions

00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:41,079
hi two quick questions how do you

00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:44,050
compare it with a USP in regard to your

00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,650
transponder so even if Android is open

00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,540
source

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:50,140
they it gets developed behind closed

00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:56,890
doors so changes or requests by the

00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:59,490
community gets upstream and the second

00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:04,390
question if I may

00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:07,900
when I go to your website and I am a pie

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:10,780
what do I buy do I buy a compiled image

00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,270
that I can compile myself or is that

00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:16,900
specific image for the Xperia form

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:22,180
available online so to customers Boras

00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:26,050
model and what do I buy yeah so the

00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:30,579
governor's Ferrell will simply speedy

00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:33,430
use the repositories openly so say my

00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:36,670
services is not fully open source sorry

00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:40,030
but the UI level has some closed package

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:44,079
sees but like I said the hardware

00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:46,720
updation the middleware that that's well

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,420
on this project both are both are open

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,490
source and we use the the repositories

00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:55,690
as they are in the public so it's not

00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:57,760
like the code drop every every not if

00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:02,950
there is a fix it will be in the

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:06,369
repository we have a verb actual for for

00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:08,770
for the Merc launching system open

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,380
source part to find five issues there

00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:14,349
and similarly we have the together la

00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,900
jolla Tom Foreman that change was

00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:19,390
mentioning where you gotta have a locker

00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,160
it's got a request

00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:24,700
- this kind of feature and that one

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,549
feature and we trying to follow it up

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:30,130
but of course the volume of input is is

00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:45,369
huge so capital is currently a response

00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:47,170
to this request I think it partly

00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:51,160
answered by saying it's not completely

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:53,380
over please feel free to up yeah yeah so

00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,589
with the beat the licensor beat the

00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,390
license you get the downloadable limits

00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:01,269
that we will just class on your device

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,970
and in fact even faster to as many

00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:06,400
devices as you want but there are some

00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,559
certain commercial components that you

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,980
need to download folder from the yova

00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:14,410
store and that's tight to your account

00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,029
so you can have that only on one device

00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:22,089
so for example the the Android runtime

00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:40,240
is is that component that you can only

00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:42,730
have one device based on either why why

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,740
whatever solution you lived into or you

00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:51,730
selected and

00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:52,300
the chromium OS it's not based on our

00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,810
books

00:46:52,300 --> 00:47:04,780
it's a silencing original developer

00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:06,369
company called Maria acquired necessary

00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:14,290
lysosome rocks for it that we are

00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:17,640
maintaining now it has worked well so

00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:20,410
far so we haven't taken a look at the

00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:25,330
alternatives for it so there's of course

00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:27,369
I getting in agree with our crowning is

00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:29,710
somehow duo will be the reasonable

00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:32,500
effort when you want to bind it well the

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:35,800
user experience and integrating into the

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:38,830
OS in a controlled way then there's all

00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,550
sort of binding that we need to consider

00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:44,800
that how you share images from this side

00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:47,080
of the OS with the others having to

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,230
visit that so once we have all those

00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,910
issues sorted out once the biggest was

00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,190
to make the window managed strength of

00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,230
the Android apps as you know we have a

00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:59,170
multitasking view with it why apply

00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:02,080
previews of the Android apps so once we

00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:06,070
have that working and 3su sorted out

00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:25,680
mostly then the changing just even

00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:28,740
though it's been using seditious

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,599
resolution in the initial versions and

00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,940
one thing that happened was a problem

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,220
and I know if it still the history was

00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:40,120
that I was acutely daughter I was seeing

00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:43,690
box on my phone and the apps were

00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:48,700
those laws as it still history and if so

00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:50,980
why is it's the truth source so the

00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:56,320
situation is all is pretty much the same

00:48:50,980 --> 00:49:02,920
browser is open source documents viewer

00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:07,450
is open source and the reason is simply

00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:13,060
the the investors so it somehow in the

00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:19,660
in the company structure that for the

00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:24,250
new software or that if we change the

00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:27,100
ownership of the developed assets we

00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:30,850
need to prove up from company board and

00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:33,700
those are investors and representatives

00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:36,640
and they are very very careful and we

00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:39,780
have a financial challenges during the

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,210
the past couple of years

00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:48,400
unfortunately the arguments for opening

00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:52,270
up more have not been able to speak well

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,580
enough in that situation and it is still

00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:57,910
in develop a complete DNA that we want

00:49:54,580 --> 00:50:02,050
to do it go forward with it and exactly

00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:04,360
the apps is something that very one may

00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:07,210
be think that is easiest to start people

00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,760
spend shouldn't be that much risk in

00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:12,970
opening up sources of calculator

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:17,170
application also application these are

00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:21,690
not application so that would be double

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,690
bill stop or showing some progress feed

00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:33,799
you depend on other people hard work if

00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:37,650
they decide to shut down of Sony decided

00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:39,720
licensing and we've got her left eye by

00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:43,789
experience today I buy selfish but

00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:47,160
tomorrow the idea of experiencing back

00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:51,539
butanol deep opening is done if there is

00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:53,849
nothing more what is that for me well of

00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:56,400
course your device will continue working

00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:58,589
so they cannot shut down after you have

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,869
installed at selfies on it you just

00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:06,329
cannot have the next device from Sony

00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:08,789
we cannot currently that that there will

00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:11,760
continue to be this kind of manufactures

00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:14,460
there but but at the moment there still

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:20,250
are many of my lecturers that like to

00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:22,289
keep of course if the company is strong

00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:26,339
enough financially then we can consider

00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:31,500
doing our own devices again but I think

00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:34,380
more natural is that that the while the

00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,930
business is getting better the licensees

00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,210
will see opportunity also in Europe to

00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:42,329
bring their devices available in

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:47,940
European Union markets as well in

00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:50,869
addition to their their own markets to

00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,869
have any more questions

00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,480
so yes there's no personal and I guess

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,530
it's one more round of applause for

00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:09,859
Bessemer engines

00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:09,859
