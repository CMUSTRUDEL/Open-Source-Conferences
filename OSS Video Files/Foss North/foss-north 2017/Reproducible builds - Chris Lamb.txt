Title: Reproducible builds - Chris Lamb

Description: 
	Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or "compiled") packages to end users.

The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical binary packages are always generated from a given source. This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously infect or blackmail all developers attempting to reproduce the build.

This talk will focus heavily on how exactly software can fail to be reproducible, the tools, tests and specifications we have written to fix and diagnose issues, as well as the many amusing "fails" in upstream's code that have been unearthed by this process. In addition, you will learn what to avoid in your own software as well as the future efforts in the Reproducible Builds arena.
