Title: Encrypting at the Source - Protection from Creation - Zifra
Publication date: 2017-05-05
Playlist: foss-north 2017
Description: 
	In many parts of the world, journalists and human rights activists have their equipment seized or checked by oppressive forces. The information carried by these individuals can be compromising to themselves and their sources. Nowadays, nothing is done to protect this information before it reaches a safe environment, so anyone with a physical access to the journalists' cameras and memory cards can see their content.

The team from Zifra will introduce their encrypting memory card and present how it can solve the challenges of journalists and human rights activists around the world, by protecting the information from its creation. The importance of the design of the user experience and the role of the user-friendliness in information security products for non-technical users will also be discussed.

Zifra is a Gothenburg-based startup that develops a live-encrypting memory card to protect information from the moment of its creation.
