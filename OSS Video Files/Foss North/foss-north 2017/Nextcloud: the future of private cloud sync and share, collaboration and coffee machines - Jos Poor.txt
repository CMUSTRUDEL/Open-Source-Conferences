Title: Nextcloud: the future of private cloud sync and share, collaboration and coffee machines - Jos Poor
Publication date: 2017-04-29
Playlist: foss-north 2017
Description: 
	The Cloud continues to be all the rage, despite the hate most techies have for it ("what does it even mean") and (because techies tend to be right) the confusion about what it means. One thing most people associate the cloud with is: that vague, amorphous place where your data goes after you've captured it with your phone, laptop or fancy IoT device. That place is invariably not under your control - it is how the tech giants provide 'value' (and keep you locked in). It is also the place from where your data leaks, in high profile hacks or direct attacks from, presumably, Russians, or Chinese. Well, and Germans and Italians and everything else, both criminal and, more outrageous, government sanctioned.

Nextcloud's ambition is to give you a chance to take it back, that stuff from the cloud. Control it, decide where it is and who has access. And we've built an ecosystem around our web server and apps that helps you do that. You can store and sync your files, calendar and contacts. Share holiday pictures. Listen to music. Keep your passwords secure. Edit documents, with others, collaboratively. Have video calls. All that, and more! Just not yet coffee. But you can get involved and make it happen...

And obviously, when you claim to be the future, you have to address the elephant in the room: the past. So I'll talk about why and how we left ownCloud, the project we ourselves started.

mother was interested notice her

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,870
everybody settling in coming well this

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,380
works

00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:12,210
alright so sir Berliner I have access to

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,830
an almost unlimited supply of club

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,080
Martha but I must say I really like

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,630
these things as well you're interesting

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,420
I think there are probably at least 12

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,400
to 15 kinds of different kinds of Martha

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,490
in Berlin but the now also mixing it

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,430
with banana which I do not like I do

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,390
like to ginger ale variation anyhow

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,450
let's talk about clouds a little bit

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,559
about me so I live in Berlin and I do

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,660
like the Marte

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,420
I wasn't born there though with my dad

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,430
was it's a farm in the southwest of the

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,579
Netherlands my wife still calls me farm

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,100
boy sometimes I come from a small island

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,140
I mean village about 3,000 people or I

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,850
grew up so after that when I went to

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,160
study in the big city that was you

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,480
attract 100,000 people I thought that

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,329
was quite the upgrades and we

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,820
appreciated it until I met my wife in

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,470
Brazil well we met in Finland but she's

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,180
Brazilian and she lives in a 1 million

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,159
people plus city and of course that's

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,890
Neil de Janeiro and Sao Paulo there

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,330
we've got 20 million so you know for her

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,740
death wasn't really big so we moved to

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,590
Berlin when she felt a little more at

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,570
home which is a great place to live so

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,299
open source has been a hobby for me I

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,220
studied psychology and after that I did

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,450
some business consulting you know Lean

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,189
Six Sigma all that boring stuff but then

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,140
open source in my free time I mean I was

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,700
fascinated by this whole thing of people

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,380
work together in the free time and of

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,170
course I quickly became one of these

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,570
idiots as well and the KT community

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,640
where did marketing promo helping people

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,710
out writing articles about what's going

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,460
on first blogs and articles

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,580
they're better this way alright anyway

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,430
at some point SUSE Linux hired me to

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,979
become community manager for openSUSE

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,100
that was around 2010 I did that for a

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:08,920
couple of years then I work at UM cloud

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:12,880
and now next level now for me let's talk

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,569
about this now and dr. description

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,569
talked a little bit about cloud stuff

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:23,170
I'm gonna take a very simple definition

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,580
of it we'll get to that and then I'm

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,670
going to talk about file syncing share

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,140
which is one of the things in there and

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,030
what's next if you have questions please

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,070
just interrupt me you can wave and

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,660
there's microphone somewhere that can

00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,370
give to you but I can also repeat the

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,900
question I prefer to be interrupted to

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,519
be honest then again I know you're

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,350
probably all kind of leeway to fly to do

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:47,319
that so I can live with question after

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:48,730
waterfall story right Klaus so I don't

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,640
think I need to tell you what is awesome

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,670
about clouds and these big companies

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,799
Amazon Google Facebook Microsoft Apple

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,480
or for many others they've built really

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,510
amazing services for all of us our

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,760
YouTube Gmail Facebook Dropbox tumblr

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,590
and we put all our data online because

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,870
it's awesome now the services are often

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,370
easy to use they they can be access

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,540
everywhere it is to share with other

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:16,660
people and if you lose your phone you

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,700
know you just log in or another house

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,620
and you have all the data again and this

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,480
this kind of stuff is automation it's

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,579
very useful use it every day it's a good

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,100
reason for all this stuff it works it

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:29,650
has made our lives both a little more

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,019
busy but also a lot more productive with

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,600
my computer and of course it can also

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,790
you know two pictures of the food and

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,989
play games on these devices as well if

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:44,109
all free or very cheap now the free part

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:47,019
of course might also bring us to the

00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,600
next thing that about that side of it a

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:53,440
concern perhaps I mean it's been said

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,260
you know that if it's free then you're

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,329
not a customer you're a product and

00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,949
there are some truth to that it's spoke

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,840
the entire picture I think that they're

00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,080
certainly

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,580
thus I pray so you got to ask yourself

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,040
these questions now where is my stuff

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,120
and who can gather this and what are

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,530
they using it for

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,549
and generally speaking these these

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,980
questions aren't really answered very

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:23,280
well and if they are you wouldn't be

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:26,040
happy with it so the reason these

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,500
questions are important is privacy now a

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,150
lot of us felt a lot of talk a lot of my

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,860
time on privacy because I think a lot of

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,979
you are probably aware of the concept of

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,690
the issues with it but a very simple

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,150
thing and often you hear like I have

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,330
nothing to hide and this gets to the

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,110
core of privacy or actually not private

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,880
leave the house this is not the point of

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,010
privacy having something to hide now

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,690
first of all you have no idea what you

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,060
should be hiding because there are so

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,340
many rules and regulations over aren't

00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,090
you that you're breaking the law many

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,310
times a day without knowing it and as

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,570
they've done some studies and I think

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,300
that the average Internet user is

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,860
breaking the law multiple times per hour

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,870
and that's a normal use of just doing

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,060
normal stuff and there are so many rules

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,460
especially copyrights very complex but

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,350
also in real life you break the law very

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,030
often I mean you do know you have to

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,850
cross the street properly straight right

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,520
and if there is any energy bribe close

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,410
by and so that these are things moment

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,090
when you break the law and you do this a

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,740
lot and you probably think what what's

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,470
problem is that they're tiny things

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,479
nobody bothers with it that's true

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,490
the thing is of course or somebody wants

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,430
to bother with it and they would know

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,010
all of it they could they can't quite

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,500
now because they don't know it as of

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,389
today but the direction you are taking

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,210
with privacy is that at some point they

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:51,419
can know all the static and as there's

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,090
an example of the protests against

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,050
Keystone pipeline in the US where a

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,510
journalist was locked up for trespassing

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,220
now walking over somebody else's land

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,169
not technically yes that might be

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,510
illegal but interpreting journalists

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:09,240
there for that kind of people reporting

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,659
on it and it is obvious that that law

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,820
was used to lock up the journalists

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:16,130
because she

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,660
was annoying not the cause of the

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,330
breaking of the law itself it had

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,850
nothing to do with that now to solve the

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,980
creator there is some use for laws like

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,520
that for example in Washington State

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,160
now Washington wasn't in DC there's a

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,900
law against being smelly which seems

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,630
pretty ridiculous right and if you use

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,940
too much perfume or something now it's

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,280
for the police to allow them to

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,740
basically take homeless people away from

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,860
the court in trouble now I mean if

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,080
homeless people are being loud somewhere

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,730
that might not exactly be against the

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,200
law but the whole neighborhood has a

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,020
problem with it I mean people need to

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,460
sleep is it if it's late at night so you

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,160
have a number of these laws that are

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,360
kind of arbitrary but it can be used for

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,850
purposes like that now it's kind of a

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,500
pain that that sometimes law officers

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,990
have some freedom to to apply these

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,660
things and that's not necessarily a bad

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,340
thing but obviously it can also be used

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,380
to stop journalist to stop freedom of

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,350
speech to stop legitimate protests and

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,710
that's where it becomes a problem

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:24,680
so imagine perfect law enforcement they

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,420
would mean that well things like

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,070
revolutions you know that have resulted

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,000
in pretty much every country in the

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,360
world would never have happened

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,990
including valuating advocate for example

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,820
now the Koski

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,450
you can't splendor revolution if you

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,890
have perfect local club and no and

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,810
because everything is being controlled

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,670
and if the police would know everything

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,100
about you there's no way to conspire and

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,630
overthrow bloody government and if you

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,130
get a dictatorship it's going to stay

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,930
the deficit until the end of time

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:55,220
there's no way to do something about it

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,530
I mean perfect perfect policing would be

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,400
a huge problem for society because once

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,950
something bad

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,360
gets in there it'll never get out of

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:07,340
that again now if you have laws against

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,880
gay relationships and you just catch

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,560
every single gay person every time that

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,390
wouldn't be good and certainly wouldn't

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,340
get you know we will get merits at some

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:19,670
point I even get normal change the

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,100
society anything that is that today will

00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,990
be bad until the end of times because

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,520
nobody can break the law and figure out

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,610
a tell it's not so bad

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,240
Oh John there's no problem whatever now

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,520
you get completely stuck so privacy just

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,990
for that alone is already really

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,760
important you need to break the law

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,050
sometimes it's okay it's normal it's

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,270
healthier Society and last but not least

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,910
only privacy is basically there's a

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:50,570
reason you close a toilet door as they

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,240
often say and Emily as normal human

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,100
beings we have a need for this I mean it

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,399
takes take the average person Facebook

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:02,089
accounts now how well does it reflect

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,750
their real life and I think about this

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:07,820
for a second right you take a picture or

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,010
the evening of a party

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:15,770
lots of the results the next morning do

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:17,630
you want it but as people we have need

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,480
to portray a certain image of ourselves

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,000
right the faithful husband the

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,890
hard-working employee there the party

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,959
animal whatever we would like it's

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,940
privatize it as far as identity it's

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,440
it's part of people you always really

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,690
need to portray certain limits I mean

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,270
why do you wear it drugs you where you

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,100
try to portray certain limits and

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,620
without privacy we're effectively all

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,410
negative at least the people have access

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,870
to this data and to Facebook you kind of

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,339
like it because they can analyze on this

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,680
day of stuff that it probably doesn't

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,300
know about yourself and they've got a

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,920
number of studies of what they do you

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,620
can get out of Facebook and it's one

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,860
scary about being gay or not

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,329
for example which here is just fine that

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,920
there are countries waking it kills for

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,589
them and that means that if the

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,510
government demands for Facebook certain

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,880
data and and and life settled that way

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,630
and uses that to find out who is gay

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,100
isn't an actual death there are some

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,720
Russian states at the moment where you

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,680
can get murdered for them you do this

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,230
murder for them and not just in Russia

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:27,760
so privacy is pretty damn important I

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,410
won't make a point to much more and

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,480
there's just one last thing

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,880
I wanna

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,329
point out here and that is that if 5c

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,019
gets eroded who gets hurt

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:42,970
I have government officials and the

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:47,320
politicians arguing that we should get

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:49,660
rid of perfect encryption so if they

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,160
wouldn't be outlaw encryption for who

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,010
wouldn't be a problem would it be a

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,220
problem for government officials who are

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,019
corrupt they're part of the system they

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,430
can protect themselves it wouldn't do

00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,360
anything against corruption

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:06,490
what about organized crime big criminal

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,050
organizations they have the resources to

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,880
use encryption whether it's legal or not

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,649
it's all the legal stuff anyway they

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,529
don't care so now it wouldn't do

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:18,430
anything about organized crime terrorism

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:22,690
same story and so if you introduce laws

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:26,250
to limit privacy to do something about

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:29,079
corruption organized crime or terrorism

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,220
you like those are not the reasons to do

00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,709
it because it's not going to help

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,529
against those things it might stop a

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,870
local person doing something bad with

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,399
the won't stop organizations and then in

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,980
general the real problems in our society

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,690
like the companies who sometimes act

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,910
suspiciously much like criminal

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,010
organizations a lot of those would have

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,290
a problem with it it's only normal

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,560
people and of course journalists who are

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,130
annoying local activists you know if you

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,709
join the protest to keep certain park

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:02,260
close to your home open then you're on

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:07,300
the list from then on that's the kind of

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,399
stuff where it's a problem so what do we

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,029
do about it that's of course where it

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,069
gets interesting so in the early days of

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,569
the internet the ending of the internet

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,690
was to build a network that was

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,800
decentralized to federalize federated

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,829
nor surprised

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,420
so the idea was that if a part of the

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,959
internet will break down it will still

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,149
work and damage will be routed around

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,130
even censorship to some degree being

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:37,779
routed around by the internet it's meant

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:41,890
to be a robust structure sadly since

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,649
then things have changed as of today the

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,569
internet isn't as decentralized

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,939
was designed to be because if facebook

00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:50,579
goes down if Twitter goes down if good

00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:52,529
health goes down you know well Facebook

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,689
goes down the productivity goes up but

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,629
if github goes down a productivity goes

00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:59,879
down a lot and while the girls are most

00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:02,939
interruption and Amazon and you know how

00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,209
the Internet's not working so these

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:08,160
things are pointing to a problem like

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,959
we've been centralizing everything again

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,240
there is just a small number of

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,699
companies a couple of dozens that is

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,160
running and on our 80 90 percent of the

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,329
page views on the internet and most of

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,660
the stuff that's happening and that's

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:25,470
well that's a problem

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,329
so if we want a solution for privacy and

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,670
security we need a solution that's

00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,990
decentralized the very central planets

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,079
meaning that the government can just go

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,389
there and shut it down that's quite easy

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,129
to shut Facebook algún country gives you

00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:40,439
now facebook.com and there's you guys

00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:42,660
but everybody took longer on Facebook it

00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,829
will become a lot harder and discuss for

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,339
Cheston it's good for lots of

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:49,889
technologies so any kind of solution

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,550
needs to be secure but they also need to

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,079
be decentralized and hard to shut down

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,970
and open source I think for this crowd

00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,040
this ultimate don't need to explain the

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,449
benefits of that obviously and a

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,199
solution today's needs to the open

00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:06,420
source now I already explained for

00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:08,970
decentralization is good for so I'll

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,970
just move on but the point is of course

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,740
if you have 10,000 places rate and find

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,779
credit card information at the council

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,319
of less interesting to try and hack it

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:21,809
then when it is all in one place if it

00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:25,649
makes the value of information for a

00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:27,360
hacker also simply less the pure fact

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,399
that is decentralized makes it less

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,740
interesting for somebody to find hack it

00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,629
that in itself already is value and

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,590
backdoors come up a lot well let's not

00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:39,630
go there

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,200
that's not conversation I think many of

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,420
you don't need to be introduced to again

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,790
so the cloud is awesome there's a

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,490
problem for privacy a private is

00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,500
important so we roughly know what we

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,080
need I have something that you are

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,720
something that decentralized something

00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,730
that's secure and something that folks

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,560
will give you control off the data now

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,630
there are multiple solutions in multiple

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,720
areas but obviously I'm here to talk

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,990
about one of them next class and at the

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,690
core of it it's technology that is to

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,180
sync and share data I also think about

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,300
open source decentralized self house the

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,070
Dropbox or Google Drive or any of these

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,710
other big services to do similar things

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:26,250
it takes the boxes that we've just

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,890
discussed and more and it's easy to use

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,660
with for us is really important design

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,730
is a big part of it that's of court life

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,500
you also had a designer talk here

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,980
earlier who is also been active in the

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,110
exile community because we think that if

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,360
you're not as easy to use as the big

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,120
players then normal people aren't going

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,500
to use your technology and in think of

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,570
PGP which is very secure and nobody uses

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,260
it or almost normally because it's just

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,750
horrible

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,000
in terms of usability that's a problem

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,970
that means you've developed something we

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,740
are not making much of an impact with it

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,470
at least not as much as you need to

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,790
I mean think services like Dropbox have

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,250
hundreds and hundreds of millions of

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,560
users so if we make something that is

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,080
used by even a few million of users

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,150
which we're happy about but it's it's

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,190
not enough whereas a project would

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,440
definitely much more ambitious than a

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,950
few million users we want hundreds of

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,400
millions of users so it's a

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:29,490
cross-platform solution and next file

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,350
itself runs on UNIX systems Linux LAN

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,890
stack typically from the next Apache

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,420
MySQL PHP let's cough but the

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,190
applications are cross-platform serve

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,170
Windows Linux and Mac desktop clients

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,769
Android iOS and lobster party

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,980
applications

00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:48,619
and one of the nice things about it and

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,509
I should say here is that a lot of

00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:53,660
people they have data in multiple places

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:57,949
we have maybe an S or you have at the B

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,420
drive at University and as a company you

00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,850
probably have like like some power

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,279
windows network chair or technologies

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,649
like that so next class can act as a

00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,020
gateway to those other storage

00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:11,750
technologies so you essentially hook

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,339
your existing storage into next file and

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,740
from there you can access it and use it

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,480
wherever you go you can share it in the

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,159
doesn't matter that it's on the windows

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,130
natural try for evil Dropbox or Google

00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:27,230
Drive and well it has all these fancy

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,799
features on top of that and one nice one

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,450
there is encryption obviously it uses

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,360
encryption and communicate between your

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,059
phone and your server it also has this

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,460
nice storage encryption feature where if

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,890
you do have 50 gigabyte of free space at

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,020
global you can actually use it if you

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,120
use the encryption every file matters

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,980
and stored in Dropbox is first encrypted

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,600
by the neck start server and of course

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,639
your keys never leaves next up server

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,179
the only thing Google and whoever

00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:59,000
subpoenas the data from Google gets is

00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:00,470
encrypted files have fun at it I think

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,929
that's one of the nicest features if you

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:09,860
put it all together so you can do all

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:12,409
the stuff as if you had if you went to a

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,940
wedding and people asked ok can we share

00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:16,130
the pictures you can send the public

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,710
link with a password and expiration date

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,270
people can upload the images there you

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,690
can make a nice class with it or

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,370
something

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:27,230
now all these features are there and

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,549
even by the way this is nice obviously

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,610
I'm not synthetic

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:34,399
so federated means that local well

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,020
email is good example I might want to

00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:39,440
spend a few words explaining this

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:42,860
Federation means that multiple different

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,770
systems act as one kind of if you aren't

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,860
on Google Mail you know send an email to

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,290
somebody who is only Yahoo

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,700
server the fact that this person's of

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,980
Google and the others on Yahoo does

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,660
affect while if you're oncoming Ram and

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,090
I will signal we come talk to each other

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,090
so telegram a signal or not saturated

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,250
while email is saturated so similarly

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,660
next web servers are federated if you

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,790
want an excellent server I want an

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,470
excellent server I can share a file to

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,840
you and you'll get a notification or

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,610
your next observes and so say this guy

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,290
from that Nexon server to share a file

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,570
with you do you accept it or not so now

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,450
you can see it yes but this only works

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,480
for two mixed cloud service looks too

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,390
different like because you had webbed up

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,309
there does it work so the question that

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,190
is asked is does it work only between

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,840
extra servers are also others so it

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,880
works with others well first of all L

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,370
transpose which next slide is a for call

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,260
but we work with PI DL which is another

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,559
open source file signature solution we

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,510
work with them to implement it so the

00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,400
sharing protocols outsource protocol

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,760
it's mostly web database in a couple of

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:52,960
rest calls to do call sharing itself

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:58,630
it's pretty simple it's an I think it's

00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:00,309
called the open open cloud nice API so

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,929
we certainly want a lot of projects are

00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,929
implemented as well and one of them

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,720
already has so yeah we want this to be

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:14,320
cross cloud not just between excellence

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:16,179
ideally and it's easy to deploy a lot of

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,700
people aren't big fans of our language

00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,860
or another and I will I give you every

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,110
complaint to have about PHP you totally

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,700
right over the thing is of course there

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,840
are hundreds of thousands of people know

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,530
the language which makes it easy to get

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,330
contributors and there are well almost

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,640
Goodin limited places where you can run

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,320
it plus that every administrator knows

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,710
how to run it how to scan and how to

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,770
secure it which makes these choices of

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:48,340
his for us back in 2010 on the protocol

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,630
started and still today and it doesn't

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,730
mean of course you can't have a very

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,470
secure Security's pretty much a higher

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,610
priority as a project because in the end

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,770
it's all secure privacy doesn't mean any

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,020
okay now you can put something out

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,540
server but it's easy to hack it and you

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:06,110
didn't really gain any anything that was

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:08,000
that so we work according to really

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,460
strict security policies have everything

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,559
reviewed we do developer training at our

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,390
conferences around security we review

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,520
everything specifically for security

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,470
we're all security scans we have

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,080
security bug bounty program if you find

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,140
a security bug and next well you can get

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,299
up to five thousand euros for us so we

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:32,299
really put a lot of effort to keep their

00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:35,390
secure as humanly possible and it's very

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,549
accessible because there's more than

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,400
file sync and share and neck strap is

00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:42,440
built as an F platform we have over 50

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,840
maintained apps at the moment that of

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,730
different kinds of external storage that

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,070
are different authentication mechanisms

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:53,990
are all that open ID and you name it and

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,929
that also things like calendar contact

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,490
email music player video player and

00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,990
functionality like that sort of all

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,260
kinds of stuff that you can find in our

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:06,710
app store and we'll get to some examples

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:09,410
later the last but not least as I've

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,530
said many times it's open source hooli

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:15,140
ATPL no shenanigans just purely

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,380
completely open now develop interpretive

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,700
github and anybody can get involved of

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,100
course if you want to roll this as a

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,910
company and have 20,000 users they'd get

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,770
their work done

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,230
would be stupid not to get a support

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,090
contract we offer does do that's what

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,520
made my bills as well as those with any

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,010
of my fellow developers next lab game

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,960
they had German company that offers long

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,640
term support as well as support

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,640
contracts for enterprises that use this

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,370
so going back a time a little bit a

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:51,710
little bit of history so all this

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:54,410
started in 2010 San Diego Frank Carla

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,299
tech founder of own cloud gave talk

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,090
about essentially the problems that I've

00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,890
described earlier as well as potential

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,720
solutions to the court at that point

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,970
there wasn't really good solution and he

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,600
said we should start a project to build

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:11,169
one I was Katie project in the

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,660
and well we started to build and develop

00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:18,789
and the project that well I just

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,500
presented to you in 2011 first meeting

00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:22,299
two places the picture look for prior

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,990
five people on the Left their strengths

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:28,059
and in 2016 at the conference we have

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,620
the same people still they're still

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,250
active in the project which i think is

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,350
really cool

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:41,500
something is later so many people still

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:44,470
around well in I have to go back here in

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,850
2012 Frank started the company with a

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,470
bunch of external investors to

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,320
essentially hire people and work on a

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,289
GPL code now that this was model of the

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,480
company was to well about the open core

00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:57,309
model if you not familiar with the model

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,280
the idea is that the core of the product

00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:02,380
is completely open but every developer

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,480
has to assign a copyright to the company

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,900
so the company can make proprietary

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,659
atoms or boxes now the amount of open

00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,820
versus closed you do conferring some

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:15,039
open core projects are very little open

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,150
and it's mostly closed on a project see

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,100
with the other way around I think

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,080
unfunded is pretty good job must it was

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,080
open but all real Enterprise

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,679
functionality was closed and this model

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,179
worked reasonably well in 2014 a very

00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,669
arrogantly put that date in there

00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:33,990
because that's what I joined so that

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,460
only matters to me but at that point I

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,780
worked at Sousa and I had a discussion

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,260
with Frank about become community

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,760
manager for own cloud and I asked a

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,830
couple of my friends what they thought

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,039
about Oakland about joining the company

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,789
and one of them was guilt grief is the

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,120
founder of the Free Software Foundation

00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:53,320
Europe and he had a big concern with

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,990
regard to the business model of the

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,840
company a policy of a standard so he

00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,559
said look the thing is the company knows

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,539
the codes

00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,919
it owns the product it controls a

00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,720
community it's a single company

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,390
community no other company can really

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,990
easily contribute because of this

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:14,470
ownership thing and second of all the

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,990
venture capital owners in the US bank in

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,490
turn on the company that's a pretty nice

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,649
he said that the can go really wrong

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,500
and I said well yeah that's that's a

00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:26,120
point so I brought it up in one of the

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,740
homes racers have with Frank about

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,720
during the company I said what are you

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,020
thinking said well he's right

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,580
that's true he said the thing is it's

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,429
all ngel go clear out

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,770
so if or at all as many of you probably

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:44,179
know as a destroyer of open source in

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:46,970
Oracle by don't cloud I will for and the

00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:51,080
other will join me and the only thing

00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,330
we've lost then is all these years the

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,659
only thing we've lost is the company but

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,490
all the codes all the work that was done

00:25:55,659 --> 00:26:01,340
it's still there we can just continue

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,789
maybe start a new company well that

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:08,419
obviously brings us to 2016

00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:10,340
cuz that's more or less what happen in

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:13,070
June second we announce next file

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,270
there's a new company I don't want to go

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,820
long into why we quit while you left I

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:23,870
mean obviously I get the hint just now

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:26,090
so there you go and I can after that the

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:30,700
way I see it and why we see is this look

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:32,690
we fired management and continued

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,210
management happen to have all the

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,429
trademarks so there's no spill oil cloud

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,649
but we continued it's the same crew the

00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,419
same people who wrote the Carlton are

00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:43,720
just continuing its development pretty

00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:46,070
much to all community as John does and

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,990
many customers are following as well

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:52,279
we're profitable already we're doing

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,630
well real for 30 people so ok and that's

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,039
they might all I want to say on the

00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:01,850
subject we their first release on June

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:03,380
14 next lap 9 with it then also the

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,000
Android app completely done by

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,770
volunteers and that continued to be

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,840
completely volunteer project until

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,330
February of this year and it's we hire

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,730
people the volunteer system is amazing

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,730
you're better than it has done all the

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,529
years before a ton crowd if you ask me

00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:23,669
it's pretty awesome example of the power

00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:26,250
of community and for iOS we partnered

00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:28,970
with company that have built already a

00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:33,000
fact an own class compatible alternative

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:35,190
client for iOS and initially their

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,130
application continue to be proprietary

00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,380
but we worked with them and in February

00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,020
of this year they open source the iOS

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,169
client completely included an exception

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,350
for the Apple Store so that means it's

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:51,330
really GPL except that the Apple Store

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,860
doesn't allow pure GPL applications in

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,990
there actually has the open exception

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,820
for that which we did to work with the

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,419
episode video that to have the right

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,130
exception text in there which I'm also

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,409
very proud of for me we can even now

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:07,980
help open source other projects and

00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:09,210
things to what we're doing next well

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,070
tell them in August

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,539
essentially next row of ten was based on

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,000
ultra apply for twelve minutes of the

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,830
future frames where we left so this was

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,350
a matter of stabilizing and publishing

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:24,840
it our first real release was next 111

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,600
which was pretty much all about security

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,669
as scalability so making a lot faster

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,909
especially in large instances for large

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:36,000
customers and large providers as well

00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:37,289
and making it a lot more secure to

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,330
introduce brute force protection

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:43,260
two-factor authentication lots of other

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:45,120
features that keep it safe and next 412

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,730
is coming next month and I'm going to

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,620
talk about that a bit later I'll skip

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,480
this well that's part of a team that

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,490
this was the picture was taken when we

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,070
were at twenty people were now over 30

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,630
and this was a picture of the community

00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,970
but that's also gone to over hundred

00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,740
that doesn't really fit anymore so I'll

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,940
just keep the picture and we did the

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,169
next web conference in Berlin and August

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,890
September last year

00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:15,480
yeah September there was fun

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:17,820
so let's talk about what comes next so

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,130
we build a file sink into your solution

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,360
which is also an exit form so it does a

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,070
couple of other things that are really

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:28,260
cool and as far as I'm concerned for a

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,500
normal user provided you can run a

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,270
server or pay for another provider the

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,960
problem of syncing and sharing files

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,900
into diesel next one has is just done

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,970
it's easy to use it worked really well

00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,280
it has climbed for every platform that

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:50,220
do everything you need the basic

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,990
functionality is there but today people

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,660
expect a little more the thing is if

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,040
somebody shares a file with you you want

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,020
to know more you want to know soft

00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,910
contacts you want to say now why if I

00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,360
share what they expect from you what you

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:05,669
can do with it so you want to have

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,750
communication and you want to work

00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:11,730
together so this is going to be the

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,130
focus for next 112 and that has been the

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,130
focus already for a while for us we

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,830
introduced Kalevala online earlier at

00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:22,500
the end of last year we can real-time

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:26,010
edit documents in Google Docs or office

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,990
365 and we work on making that those

00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:32,190
features better and better integrated an

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:35,280
extra 12 and we made sharing more

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:38,850
flexible so for example and in X 12 and

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,650
11 you could make a share for someone

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,990
you could either share to other users on

00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,000
your next round you could share to use

00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,640
this on other next clouds or patios or

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,169
el cloud servers and you can create a

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,500
public link that you could email to

00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:55,559
people now at 12 you can also just enter

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,410
people's email address and as many as

00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,980
you want they will each get a private

00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:05,040
public link forgive me the wording of

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,410
them and each of these links you can

00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,940
separately configure in terms of access

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,530
rights so you can send the link to

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,780
someone where you can only upload files

00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:15,270
to you they tell me to see - faster than

00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,850
in there with an expiration date for

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,679
next month and then you can give to

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,910
other people each a link where you can

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,430
see and edit

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:26,460
but they have and her password first

00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:28,650
with now expression that so it's really

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,030
flexible to you know work with other

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,010
people you can just give everyone

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:36,780
exactly the kind of access that they

00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:38,670
need and also internally now if you

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,010
share a file internally you can put an

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,960
expiration date on it which wasn't

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,910
possible before I think that's also nice

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,520
now password but that's kind of silly of

00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:51,510
course you already logged in so it makes

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,670
our sense so another feature that we

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:57,180
introduce next at eleven was audio/video

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,040
calls so you have built in an app how do

00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,190
you fit across every and pull somebody

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:05,160
for your web RTC maybe browser or on the

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:07,530
phone Ethan was quite well in that some

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,700
phones and other numbers still we work

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,950
on apps for that as well

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,260
and that's for twelve we make it more

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,120
integrated so wherever you are in the

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,380
user interface you can and you see an

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,390
avatar of somebody because they

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,800
commented on the file or because it

00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,240
share the follows them or they share the

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,910
fall of you you can click the other car

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,040
you can send them an email or chat with

00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,740
them or give them a call just right from

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,410
there so make make the integration more

00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,200
seamless and you can also do screen

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:36,690
sharing now with next lat 12 which is

00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,720
for for collaboration is quite nice as

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:43,020
well love with not least we introduced

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,200
push notifications now if you up all of

00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:49,230
this up you get this scenario where you

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,720
know somebody sexual file you're from

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:55,590
penis assess oh another not you've got a

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,720
file share you open the file and you

00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,240
think huh look am I supposed to do with

00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,250
this so you click on the Avatar you call

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,810
them and then their phone rings because

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,400
of who does connects again let's take

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:08,460
happily discuss the file while you

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,380
collaboratively working it and all of

00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,740
these these features are falling into

00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,500
place

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,170
now that's really cool because there's

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,180
even can work we're not done yet at the

00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,000
saturation part between still not call

00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,550
these calls to be federated so it can

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,760
call somebody on another server and at

00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:28,560
that point when fully decentralized

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,810
real-time phone system

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,880
and nobody else has that it's pretty

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:35,100
good I think well you have something

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,600
royalties for that but if it's a life

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,440
into private and also you can share this

00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,690
this is really a next thing that we're

00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,950
working on so the push notifications are

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:49,380
coming in 12 and the avatar clicking is

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,150
coming in 12 the Federation of calls is

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,420
not coming in 12 yet will working on it

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:57,150
still then there's a whole bunch of

00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,730
other features around collaboration and

00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:04,020
you can have guests I create your group

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,850
of people and a bunch of other

00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,620
application mechanism is of course the

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,300
basics for that as well we have a lot of

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,419
security work we have none or more

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,070
scalability and perform of work we

00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:17,220
operate limiting to the brute force

00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:19,470
protection and upgrading is go more

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,210
smooth so if you're currently in as many

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:23,190
of the next web server you will probably

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,050
be very happy to hear that you will no

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,870
longer have to re-enable the apps after

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,570
an update yay other people found that

00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,429
quite annoying including myself so that

00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:36,870
is fixed because what we do now is we

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:39,480
try to upgrade yes and then it'll break

00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:42,030
it just disable it again it wasn't

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,480
possible before because of php5

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:48,390
which can't catch an exception like

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,929
operating so if this would happen on a

00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:55,710
Nextel server and you are tried one of

00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:57,810
these apps has a bug your fervor breaks

00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,610
everything is broken your whole operator

00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:01,050
screwed up with nothing you can do we

00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,510
thought it would be a little better to

00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,040
them after paying for each of the

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,680
elements so have to be in able the apps

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,660
by hand but now we can have a cake and

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,940
either do so long with the progress of

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:17,550
technology so yes please accept we want

00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,620
support language support for example

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:26,370
sites and SharePoint integration because

00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:29,100
yes companies they need us now I'll edit

00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:31,140
them out or I think I may be set up next

00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,450
month well but that's just me

00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,369
I'm not saying

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,950
we presented all that will be nice to

00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:39,920
have a monkey back today so I'm going to

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:42,500
forgive them however we're not even in

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,490
that buy yet that means what I've done

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,050
is I've taken a snapshot of master

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,820
merged a couple of branches that weren't

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,670
done yet because of Allah to show the

00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,829
features and then discover of course

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,190
that the whole thing broke and finally

00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:01,490
kind of halfway having sort of running

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:03,460
so this is one of the worst kind of demo

00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,960
so we see you can do on the other hand

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,560
some of the stuff works and that's still

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,450
nice so and after I've temperature

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,770
expectations a little bit I think I'm

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:19,900
man I'm hoping forgiving this will fine

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:19,900
so let me see how well this will go all

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:27,190
right so let's first login as admin

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:35,000
welcome here we are so one of the

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,550
changes is that we've now put the menu

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,530
here on top if you're all about

00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,050
collaboration and getting your stuff

00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,210
done in this one interface and not just

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,740
about syncing sharing files we should

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,930
actually make these absolute more

00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,579
prominent there used to be in a menu but

00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,319
now they're always on top there and if

00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:54,050
you switch between an application for

00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,700
example building products then you know

00:36:54,050 --> 00:37:00,740
you can just see and switch between

00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:02,510
these different groups and areas we have

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,280
a whole kind of whole bunch of different

00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,460
applications with Kanban board

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,060
application which is still very work in

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,170
progress

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,270
calendar it just for the compactor this

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,510
is a video course up which is certainly

00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,359
not working because it stops at this

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:26,300
point and that's what you get when you

00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:29,270
have a yeah check out of master I can

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:32,810
show you our new apps interface so you

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,670
can install apps or put them this as you

00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,589
see this in front of it mobile optimized

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,430
interfaces that on the desktop doesn't

00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,800
look that awesome

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,710
my opinion

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,170
complain to the designers about this but

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,550
I have a list of your abs and if you

00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,170
have an internet connection wait sit

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,950
down for the moment you will also see

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:54,270
more apps than me maybe the network that

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:56,860
will show up the Navigator than later

00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:04,090
aligator can easily enable disable

00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:06,310
that's so in terms of new features well

00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:11,710
as you see this as an alpha as in just a

00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:15,010
directed check out so one thing we've

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,630
done so next up a level introduced brute

00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:19,080
force protection and well that

00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,420
effectively does is if somebody tries to

00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,220
guess your password just as many times

00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,230
as is needed a mediation computer right

00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,260
you've been fired thousands of letters

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,120
per second well lots of this because

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,520
after you've tried ten times we've got

00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,320
it wrong it will slow down the rate at

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,600
which you can retry and at some point

00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,700
you can only try once a minute and once

00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,110
a minute still might sound very fast and

00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,060
yes for a human it wouldn't be a big

00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,980
problem but of course for a computer

00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:49,180
that means you can only do 60 times a

00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,920
second minute an hour can only do 60

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,050
times an hour which is nothing compared

00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,210
hundreds of thousands of times it would

00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,580
normally try an hour and if you have a

00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:01,090
even a multi complex password of course

00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:04,480
60,000 hour will look a lot of Jupiter

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:06,460
bragging and what we've done is we we

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,140
expended route four so now as developer

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,870
you can altitude for protection to your

00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,820
application as well and rather little

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,850
app where you can whitelist certain

00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,440
ranges so you can actually well not root

00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,450
for protecting these area for a

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,610
chocolate you want to run the test or do

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:30,670
something else then you can protect like

00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:33,400
that all right let's see if a network

00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:37,370
connection works now we go

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:41,630
that's again and we move all this mass

00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:43,310
goes up alright so well there's a

00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,380
brute-force settings you see I have

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,550
enabled this I can disable it and then

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,590
it will just disappear

00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:51,080
I still factor authentication these two

00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:54,020
are installed as well yes also as you

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,550
saw some more and our apps there's

00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,170
already quite a bunch of apps actually

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:01,040
available for this release which is

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:03,290
really cool and there's full-text search

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,490
which we introduced in 11 of course also

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,720
available for 12 called borrow online

00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,640
for that you need to have a separate

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,590
server running with collab or Adele so

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,240
that takes a bit of work to set it up

00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:23,480
for a Roma home user and there's a video

00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:27,880
calls app and a calendar contact mail

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:31,220
and other applications like that so

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,160
that's an app store and it's very easy

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,500
to to install an application because you

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,570
don't need to do anything to install it

00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,820
right if I click on enable it's now

00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:44,600
being downloaded from server installed

00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,030
enabled we try to hide like details like

00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,150
it's on a server somewhere else from the

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,710
user much as possible and you see that

00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,880
it then appears here and now I can

00:40:51,710 --> 00:41:00,890
switch to the other see if it works it

00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:04,220
doesn't create problems ok so there was

00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:07,340
some yet monography

00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,770
so let's move out and see what a normal

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:15,920
user sees and I'm going with evening

00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:19,480
over here so we share some files in our

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,040
puppy shared by dog fan and you can see

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,470
that here's a menu where you can have

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,130
where you have all your contacts you can

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,750
email them and this is where my merging

00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,440
of pull requests didn't go far enough

00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,850
clearly and once we're done with final

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,130
release you'll also be able to call

00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,980
somebody here or start a chat or other

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:43,430
things but I already broken up

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:47,210
capitis well there's something here with

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:50,150
just the middle to right now but if I

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,670
click here on the icon you will see the

00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:56,660
same menu although you also see we found

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:58,760
the bug which I am ready reporter and we

00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:03,200
can share with more people so we can say

00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:05,240
well let's share this with hidden hidden

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,870
now there are two ways in which you can

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,600
share the top one here is remote this

00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:14,120
means that this is a share to the user

00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,710
hidden as classical Kipnis of common

00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,900
other words and other next class or five

00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:22,160
your server and then the user will get a

00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:25,070
pop-up if we try this we should get a

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,230
warning that you know sharing puppies

00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,940
filled because there is no such server

00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,400
which make sense Chris of course I just

00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:39,950
made it up mess up so now that does not

00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:42,290
work what does work believe it is a

00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,880
forced to send an email which sends the

00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:47,560
personalized email that I mentioned

00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,220
earlier how this file is already shared

00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,710
all right

00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,480
it was done already done by dog fan

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,550
separately and it keep track of that

00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,780
fascinating I didn't even know that

00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:02,600
which file it means you so the folder

00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,240
that I click here its puppies and you

00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:10,520
see here copies and this is what we're

00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:14,030
sharing here so let's share maybe

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:18,320
important data that was shared to us by

00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:20,600
the admin here what I can email there it

00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:26,810
does work as you can see and then we can

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:30,050
share this with hidden kitten pull it

00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,670
also automatically alright now we'll

00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:37,190
just make something up I email it to

00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:41,660
myself there we go

00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:44,810
just by email and decide no warnings you

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,880
see I can edit the file if you go in

00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:50,830
here you can say well you can edit

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,830
actually you can only upload files

00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:56,959
you can stash your protection and make

00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,709
up a nice password set an expiration

00:43:56,959 --> 00:44:04,219
date or not and you can then share it

00:44:00,709 --> 00:44:10,279
again if you like so what this does is

00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:11,959
that it gives you a upload only lead I'm

00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:14,299
going to give show that as an example

00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:16,819
here we share the file via a link I

00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:19,670
could also open my email and look up

00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:25,930
website and to let you for that so

00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:29,410
secure drop and we open a portal in the

00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:31,249
paste URL and this is all you will see

00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:33,709
irrespective of the content of the

00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:35,329
folder you can only upload faster and

00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:37,670
not see the contents that's the ideal

00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:40,069
secure drop and for a company of course

00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,349
is very useful to customer me to upload

00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:44,059
files to you you have multiple customers

00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,339
you can get in the same link or a

00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:50,119
different length feed in Albania or

00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:52,430
unique link to this forward and then you

00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,109
can put the expiration date amazing and

00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,390
they can always felt fast you in the

00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:59,059
folder but they can't see each other

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,459
files which is sometimes quite important

00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:06,890
of course for that security and privacy

00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:10,519
for your customers and now it's not

00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:14,390
again so that's pretty much the stuff I

00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:18,259
could get working also it's relatively

00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:20,269
short notes so I will try not to bother

00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:22,430
you too much with with more or less

00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:33,559
broken stuff and see you can continue

00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:35,479
the presentation lovely monthly again so

00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,099
well here are screenshots of the things

00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:40,239
I just showed you so I don't need to

00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:40,239
repeat this obviously

00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:46,960
because these things you've seen that's

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,819
a cuticle so I already talked a little

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,740
bit about security kind of things about

00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:54,549
like lifting another thing that we are

00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:58,630
there is rate limiting its kind of

00:45:54,549 --> 00:46:02,680
similar except that it's used internally

00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:04,690
for example the number of remote shares

00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,750
you can receive from other servers in a

00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:09,700
certain time which can essentially more

00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,559
of like spam protection to that on a

00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,349
very technical level and philosophy use

00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:19,119
this as well there are some examples the

00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:20,619
documentation common was 12 we also made

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,240
a bunch of changes to two-factor

00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:24,519
authentication we now support hardware

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,250
keys so you can have you be key and use

00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:31,269
that or a second factor to authenticate

00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:33,819
the next one we support allows and

00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:37,059
unsolder authentication mechanisms if

00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:39,670
you want there's a number of apps that

00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:42,460
are functionality there's in circles app

00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:45,700
so on the bottom but it's not very

00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:48,400
readable you can as a user you pick it

00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,809
can create groups of your own users

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,549
again so it's kind of like a

00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:54,519
functionality we do with your contacts

00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:56,109
with another people or your Kyle if you

00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,759
have a lot of colleagues who work within

00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,000
different groups different teams this

00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:04,299
can be useful to organizing plan that

00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,430
collaboration the impersonate APIs for

00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:09,190
the admin he can impersonate users with

00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:11,079
you as user has a problem and say

00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:14,380
looking on how to do this in the admin

00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,019
and we can clicking and can see and if

00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:20,349
personated user you and then see what

00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:22,420
the problem is and it gets up allows you

00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:24,009
to create well a guest account for

00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,859
people so you can share house with them

00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:28,509
but they can't really do put their own

00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:31,809
files on that it's just a very basic

00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:33,609
account now

00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:35,140
next level evan already introduced

00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:37,240
monitoring so we can follow what's

00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,640
happening your server number of users

00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:44,109
logged in a number of shares things like

00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,279
that you have features like file access

00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:48,519
control so if you're a system

00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:50,180
administrator you can create rules for

00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:53,960
example say ok in our

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:57,140
I know the people in the HR department

00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,880
to not be able to accidentally share XLS

00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,599
sheets

00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:04,640
xlsx I think Excel 6 or of course open

00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,680
document variation of that I don't want

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,559
to accidentally share those outside of

00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,260
the organization you make a rule that

00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:16,010
says ok and I'll keep files of that

00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:18,740
mankind and n people the sharing sharing

00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:20,270
person is in the HR department then you

00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,640
know this is not accessible from outside

00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:24,260
and if somebody then if they create a

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,160
share link and they send it to someone

00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:30,010
from outside of for example IP range

00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,690
that that person will simply get a

00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,160
warning that says look this file access

00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,430
is blocked you don't have access to this

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,339
so you can use this to enforce the rules

00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:43,039
that your company has around data

00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:45,109
privacy data security maybe government

00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,809
regulation things like that as a

00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:49,940
Dominican cookies rules it because they

00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:52,730
being the core concepts of next map is

00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:56,359
to make sharing as easy as possible so

00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:58,730
you do and share all the time everything

00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:00,799
and then of course for a lot of evidence

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,049
sounds really scary because they're used

00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:04,490
to have this directory structure you

00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:07,099
know like we did the company summer

00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:08,690
share or NFS or whatever it is the

00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:10,579
windows that would drive which is very

00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:12,829
rigid structure and you effects to this

00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:15,109
off to look at them that we'd only there

00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,390
you don't really have much of that in X

00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:19,970
Files we have fine grain permissions to

00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:22,309
some degree but when people are kind of

00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:25,880
encouraged to use it is to just share

00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:28,089
and we share and just yeah and that's

00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,380
nice because it increases productivity

00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:32,210
reporter we have very strict regulations

00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,670
you need certain techniques to control

00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,260
this more that's what these apps are for

00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,150
how to make it tiny because something

00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:42,740
similar are we there we're approaching

00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:44,900
the product compartment so all right I

00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:48,559
also have retention and features like

00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:52,579
that all right I will skip this down and

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:55,309
I have asked a few things so part of our

00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:59,839
mission to get everybody control back of

00:49:55,309 --> 00:50:01,760
the data also both to the point that

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,799
running server is pretty hard

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,200
running exile is simple and using the

00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:07,670
software is also very easy but of course

00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,290
you can only run next path if you

00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,270
already have a server and running a

00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:13,220
server for all of you to do it you know

00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,750
this is not a trivial thing it's

00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,970
actually quite hard certainly if you

00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,950
want to do is secure now there are next

00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:23,420
hub providers as a few dozen companies

00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:27,079
that offer you hostess next files now

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,730
one hand it's a step forward from you

00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:31,069
know how do you date at Google or

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:34,910
Facebook on the other hand it's still

00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:37,309
mochi along whole digital control so

00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:40,010
that's why we work with digital and

00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:43,130
canonical to create an excel box which

00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,559
is literally a box where you can put all

00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:48,230
your cell phone in there is a one

00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:53,180
terabyte hard drive and you bring your

00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:55,250
own time collected to the SD card that

00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:58,099
comes with it connected to the local

00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,170
network and to power and you have next

00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:01,670
time it then appears on your local

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,890
network on the address next to a

00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,780
boatload hoping you can access it you

00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,430
need to do a little more magic to open a

00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,290
boarding a firewall and get an

00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,540
accessible from the outside but it

00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,990
already lowers the bar significantly and

00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,040
the cause of evil to Snuppy

00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,660
technology it updates itself

00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,910
automatically so you're effectively

00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,690
always latest version and as secure as

00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,910
as possible

00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,890
so this is pretty nice and it's cheap

00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:29,540
and you can order it online if you're

00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:32,270
interested this is not money thing for

00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:34,309
either of all three of us so if you want

00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,700
to support next 12 I'll buy an excellent

00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:37,309
box

00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:40,640
sorry that doesn't really work we don't

00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:42,230
make diamonds but nonetheless we're very

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,730
happy that we sold a few thousand

00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,950
because it's really cool where for

00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,619
people doesn't roll off the data

00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:51,440
welcomes in the Box the pie and what

00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:53,750
comes in the box in the box comes the

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,630
box itself plus the hardware and in

00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,790
cádiz and a charger and every heart

00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,520
another part it's bringing around time

00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:04,220
thing so we have at the moment as the

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,410
current images for PI 2 and PI 3 and the

00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:09,790
box is Harper compatible for Odroid see

00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,620
to the co-founder fan I think

00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:13,300
what to do Arthur for this it's just

00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:16,030
that that really knows the pie so that's

00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:20,200
better for my marketing perspective and

00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:22,930
something competitive and also we don't

00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,450
have an OS for the outward but you can s

00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:28,300
all your own Debian or or you know that

00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:30,070
for LS you want so if you're a bit more

00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,720
of a techie and you want experiments or

00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:33,220
something like this I would order a box

00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:35,980
because it really good value for money

00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,960
and then bind outwards with it and plays

00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,970
that because in terms of performers are

00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,130
set order of magnitude better than a

00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:44,980
pint there are some other hardware

00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:47,860
devices with next level F will a city

00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:50,500
cloud all the right Street mean that was

00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,450
a projects from our part like parent

00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,850
company kind of technically we're

00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:57,790
spin-off of another company that made a

00:52:54,850 --> 00:53:01,060
split box which has secured audio video

00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:03,370
calls plug next class on it

00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,680
but it has a plus thousand year of price

00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:10,060
tag so it's meant for small businesses

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,670
like an lawyers for example who really

00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,970
needs this at mass security for

00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,400
communication with their clients so it

00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:20,560
also has all troy dish hardware that has

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,750
a specially designed security module and

00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:27,030
other stuff that gets the price light up

00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:30,550
a little bit with quite impressive stuff

00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:33,000
that's it there where and how to get

00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,000
started

00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:40,359
I have fliers and stickers out there if

00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,950
you want more please tell me cuz I've

00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:43,869
had more with me I don't want to fly

00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:46,119
them back to Berlin so please take them

00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:48,310
if you have any questions you can ask

00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:50,500
now or comfortably later of course

00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,450
that's fine too it were pretty tight

00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:56,470
schedule but let's do questions while we

00:53:52,450 --> 00:54:03,849
change speakers I can't see laughs but I

00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:06,369
guess you hear someone protected it's a

00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:08,410
good way to get back up and put it on

00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:11,470
Amazon or something so if you box space

00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:13,000
you can just easily turkey do well even

00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,680
and half court has to make sure you make

00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,020
the backup of the keys themselves as

00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,670
well it would suggest to do that yeah at

00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,910
the moment there's not really an app for

00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:23,890
that right now we need backup to users

00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:25,990
themselves however we're actually

00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:29,260
actually Frank himself is working on a

00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:31,540
backup app so with next up 12 volts it

00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,030
comes with basic apps that you you

00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:35,950
pointed to an location and it makes a

00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:38,520
backup of itself they're actually so

00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:41,220
we're making progress on that in an area

00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,150
we have been careful because this is

00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,190
something you still need to do yourself

00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,380
certainly with the next valve oxide is

00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:49,300
one hard drive an array which is

00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,099
technically possible we designed the box

00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,010
to fit two hard drives it possibly be

00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:55,180
one but the software doesn't do it

00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,190
automatically if you can make a

00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,670
subcontract nothing happens burg you'd

00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:03,240
have to do that yourself

00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,240
any more questions

00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:15,400
[Applause]

00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:18,720
the next culture show something in more

00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:22,839
advantage than the ordinary man driver

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:26,410
cannot have a couple opening makers next

00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:29,619
all the dresses and what they only

00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:32,230
replicate each other for example having

00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:34,540
your back off of each other on certain

00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,220
places and so so technically that's

00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,560
possible but it's not a function of if

00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,060
you build in the next lab itself our

00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,980
Federation feature where you can

00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,470
communicate between next class leaves

00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:47,109
the data where it is if I share a file

00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:49,869
with you you can accident on your next

00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:53,200
file but what happens underneath is that

00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:55,960
whenever you look at a file copy it edit

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,000
it your server asks it from my server

00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,690
and the reason we do that is because

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:06,579
that means I stay in control of my file

00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:09,130
and sorry no it's not distributed now

00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:11,460
exactly that's it's kind of a control

00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,319
thing at the moment however obviously

00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,060
you can use the service of process and

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:21,099
that is what they company could use any

00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:24,819
wife or something like this so I have to

00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:26,859
get movin none at all but all of you

00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:29,210
know how your glutes as you don't

00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:32,400
believe along with my jacket bear

00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,400
[Music]

00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,500
