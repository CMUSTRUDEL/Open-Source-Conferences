Publication date: 2017-04-29
Playlist: foss-north 2017
Description: 
	ManageIQ is an open-source project that allows administrators to control and manage today's diverse, heterogeneous environments that have many different cloud and container instances spread out all over the world. In this talk I will give an overview of ManageIQ's capabilities, a short demo, and introduce ways to get involved in the community.

oh all right so I'm in India I'll keep

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,440
that introduction about program you can

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,650
adjust to sign up in our conference so I

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,410
hope you can still hear me back hearing

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,970
but if I'm in rushing or even eating out

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,359
my words let me know I'll strike this

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,980
one down speak more clearly so this

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,109
range of actions how about Malaysia IQ

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,040
anybody has heard about this project

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:38,100
oh I'm glad yes yeah I come into the

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,700
room is like nobody I mean I almost it

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,739
but anyway I can't you share a good

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,539
morning full of people working on

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,450
something and often sort of you who

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,590
don't know about this maybe you can do

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,640
something is to come here so this is

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,800
like the tagline or masking some

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,629
building whatever I just I can't

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,220
discover out device and control your

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:09,860
hybrid IP environment from containers to

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:15,960
VM to cloud setups network and so which

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:18,810
what was bit about myself I started like

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,549
a first for e to the negative the source

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,320
was great at Linux

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,350
Jack in 99 I and I was you know these

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,259
people they were in surprise to the next

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:35,790
you know it came in CD that involve item

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:39,810
of computer source I joined up here in

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:43,290
2002 and and for most of my career so

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:48,780
far in the coverage here I was working

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,640
on the video video engine in cydia souls

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,759
so we can have some info and you play

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,960
video resource you bring a little code

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,180
there and actually I mention this

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,850
because some the video actually is based

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,399
on other source cross-platform project

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,849
called helix which was the for my view

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,709
network so again that's para might you

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,020
know from use the lyrics to actually

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,070
developing

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:22,310
the course project because companies and

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:25,130
for people but a cool experience and so

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,290
you know it got me more more interested

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,900
to other open source projects as well

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,420
and even though I don't really work in

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,000
me go project in Nokia I was you know

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,220
very involved in events and what's going

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,750
on there

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,960
so well you know me how I was a fitness

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:46,130
so this part of the world quite for know

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:50,900
the code and everything I've been in

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:53,810
business for almost 10 years now and so

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,880
in the meantime actually well after

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,870
living Nokia into Monday another I

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,400
co-founded this organization in helper

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,440
syndrome called Eleanor where we

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,490
organize a lot of open source related

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,930
events and that type a design eagle huge

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:14,300
i'm of event and they got a whole barrel

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,910
summers and with many open source

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,390
hardware open source is a people type of

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,440
the source project of the street map and

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:30,770
if i got and then I told the company

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:34,040
yoga in 2012 if you guys are probably

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:39,050
obvious loads of it a very well 3d and

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:42,260
it's kind of thrown ego you know and

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,750
using the verb project core and using

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,150
also staff to the specialists and

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,260
earlier on this business on asteroid oil

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,410
and fish and some parallels they're

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,920
using the vibration from the state

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:00,890
technology so I kind of straight to the

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,710
lake of development and to more reaching

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:07,310
out the developers love the developer

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:10,010
engagement events and things like that

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,140
so that was what I did only in the Yola

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:20,060
and my success is the she over there

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:22,550
James so yeah that was quite quite also

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,169
a kind of different experience of course

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,240
you know we had probably hire the

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:30,740
computer to more in front of

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:35,270
people so then I would head up

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,729
Yola at the end of 2015 I had a really I

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:41,780
was very lucky I just had to become

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,070
across this opportunity in that hat it

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,220
was looking forward to meeting manager

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:52,699
for this project IQ and you know like

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,820
it's one of Eva open sores on until this

00:04:52,699 --> 00:05:00,080
is one of the probably coolest companies

00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,849
to work for a device ID overlap edit

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,910
panel yes you know this is a great

00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:07,490
opportunity so a nice to get a job and

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,229
here today at for not talking rubbish

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,349
thank you

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,520
go ahead in my career tire when I'm

00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:16,400
single not in front of the computer

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,009
which is hacking off of my working hours

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,620
designed for a time but otherwise I'm in

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:23,960
front of big insurance which is

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,449
officially up in a symphony in a HR

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,699
office rock and some of years ago I was

00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:33,199
actually looks a lot reason we had a

00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:34,180
contest gear so nice now and something

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,949
different

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,770
so now I'm from New Orleans IQ I mean it

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:47,389
has everything on offer allow it's

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:53,389
established in 2006 so and that has

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:58,340
acquired veg IQ in 2012 and you know 1/2

00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:00,949
years - okay the code in shape and the

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,289
process is oversaw staff accepting

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,460
contributions and the licensing and

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:14,000
everything so your open source in 2014

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:17,240
so and in the meantime it's a few awards

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,130
to a couple design service and of course

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,909
our milestones which it with the

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:26,509
different uh top riders anybody knows

00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:30,500
the Red Hat product name stays on

00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:33,710
sunshine - yes one for yes thank you

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,210
very good um oh I haven't take a while I

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:43,259
could eat again um you guys eat earlier

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:45,860
my calendar are you ready yeah I don't

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,250
know how to fix it answer this question

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:55,889
on it Oh anyway yeah there's only one

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,900
person coming up so more a bit about the

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,199
kind of the technical side of it which I

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,060
won't go into much because I'm not ready

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,800
from you you know I don't code for this

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,070
project even though I used to be an

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,789
opera here I take a little girl real

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,900
spray work and UI is largely a pen

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:16,949
flying bootstraps

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,070
so yes that's a lot if a lot of things

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:23,389
have to work very slowly the you I guess

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:27,889
maybe the interface of all the mention

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:29,729
organization of cm these applications so

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,160
topless will also contribute back

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:35,280
upstream to the related projects and

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,870
there some side projects school the

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,970
utilities that support thank you so if

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,669
you're interested in more of the kind of

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,840
development side of things the website

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:54,050
and you know we are busy on Gator which

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,550
is like the chat to make it happen

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll go into that perfect information

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:07,979
today around so um the community we are

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,630
growing slowly but steadily it's holding

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:14,190
up very well known yet but above the

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,169
chin shock a lot of the novel offers the

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,979
jobs of the contribution from progress

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:23,310
as on but we also work with community

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:27,380
partners to develop it and provided both

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:29,940
of the features for a given provider so

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,899
just some numbers I need to probably

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,829
update em soon yeah I'm good they were

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,950
extracted from two months ago

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:40,250
oh yeah what they all collection is um

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,409
like a used to be just one big

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,450
monolithic lot of code because people

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,830
you know

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:51,380
so those watch one a teacher and grew

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,290
so what we are doing for a few streets

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,490
will be kind of breaking out you know

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,410
providers Amazon sure to different the

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,720
old habit repose and to make people

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,010
modular and more manageable and we

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,110
actually discovered and through this

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,769
process we are getting more velocity in

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,600
terms of development so you know they

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:15,440
also products the easier for people to

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,310
contribute especially coming like as

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,459
individuals probably quite um some say

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,339
the face a huge project is kind of

00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,589
intimidating so I think I was kind of

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:32,300
broken up to part easy to manage and we

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:35,839
need some help case artists so and these

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,149
are just little some of our partners in

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,459
watch network every not on Nakia

00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:43,310
nowadays we work with a non-elected

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:46,310
networks inside the novel recently we're

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,810
starting to integrate physical

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,940
infrastructure so you can actually

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:59,320
manage a bare metal systems which IQ and

00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:03,890
Google Google cloud and so on so are you

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,459
kind of like a high-level idea for Iraqi

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:10,490
with its kind of it fits on top of

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:13,670
different a level senators so it

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,459
actually does not connect directly to

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,180
the admin like VMs and containers but

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:23,990
what it does is it connects to the

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:30,399
advertisers by DM we're and kubernetes

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:33,589
and so on so so through these our ATI

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,290
connections and through them you get the

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:41,540
information from the elements to their

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:44,140
intelligence so you know what is that

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:48,620
did in the end is to have a unified

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,180
while single unified ay2

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,339
for you to be able to see all the

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,630
different information about different

00:10:52,339 --> 00:11:01,790
elements can here is a more detailed

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:06,490
picture of what we support

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:10,190
from middle world a popular website to

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:13,089
container as I mentioned cloud of the

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:17,149
private cloud and also Software Defined

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:19,879
Networking and Forge and we integrate

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:24,079
with things like configuration

00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:26,600
management like and for important so

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:33,430
I'll probably mention a bit more about

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:38,839
NSO in the latest life so one of the

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:41,060
kind of um immediate feature that you

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,639
can make use of in with manage

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,620
activities or we call self service for

00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,709
example if you are ending up you know a

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:52,459
lot of resources completing resource and

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:56,329
storage VN forever and people come to

00:11:52,459 --> 00:12:01,459
you you know I need to set up with this

00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:03,860
much memory interface and you know so II

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,420
used to be a four or depending on the

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,220
size of your organization and things

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:12,110
like that but you know you could maybe

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:14,149
early deploy be some requests and if you

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,819
have a lot of recursively coming all at

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:20,149
once it may take me more time so it's

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:22,339
quite dependent on you know individual

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:27,170
time and things like that you need a

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,709
mistake it's all kinds of factors

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,220
involved

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,949
so what self service gives you is to

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,519
automate this process so you can

00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:43,130
everything kind of pre-configured

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:46,370
pre-configured items or kind of requests

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:51,380
and then the user pages select ok and

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:56,360
eternities AWS on brown 7 and with this

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,040
much resources and then you just send a

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,139
request and then it's alternators we

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,910
gotta get back to them you know within

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:07,339
the hour sometimes instead of taking

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:10,009
things for manual fulfillment so of

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:14,500
course of automation and make things

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:17,770
more efficient um another thing that

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:22,150
because gelatin for inflated the whole

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:25,960
thing kind of useful is the lifecycle

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:28,570
management what it means is what happens

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,000
when all the result of the users are

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,830
done with it with the resources you know

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,380
it needs to be decommissioned you need

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,710
to be required and the lifecycle

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,240
management will have care ownership who

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,850
does what at what time

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,160
like is it will understand the choice or

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,830
after that means position is that you

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,110
will you know tricky resources

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:53,710
appropriately retire them and they

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:56,370
should you know the next request coming

00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:00,760
they are the proper for so again to

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:06,150
manage it so automation and like a

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,980
convention so this is an example of a

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:12,340
self-service catalog

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:19,240
well not look as many items here but so

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:22,210
you have AWS Reb and VMware and another

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,640
thing that is this shopping cart feature

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,380
we call which basically means you can

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,750
select multiple items and you know

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,340
spending one request for all of them so

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:38,100
you don't have to feel sequential II

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:40,330
request certain items so possible

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:48,340
services can be select at the same time

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:55,450
and route the for approval so about the

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:58,120
automation part for most of the future

00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:01,770
of the project the automation is done by

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,750
scripting and using Ruby and you know

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,850
pretty powerfully it pretty much even

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,660
you always you need write the script to

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:14,110
do whatever but on the other hand not

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,230
everybody especially on that means what

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,110
you know want to take a time or all of

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,640
these exams or to do some programming in

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,940
that sense because it is quite involved

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,870
in Africa so this whole take all right

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,430
it works

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,380
in public alone so with the recent

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,310
integration with an assault I should

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:40,300
focus on our both coming up the release

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:44,170
coming up you can actually use expose

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,460
books for saltine automation tasks and I

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,390
think that makes things a lot easier

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:51,820
because you know they either use

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,850
existing tables or you know you can use

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:58,450
a makeup table a lot easier than trying

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,600
to read some of the movie scripts so but

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,280
you know that if you can have two

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,170
choices

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,090
however you want to do it so the

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,740
scripting is available if you know that

00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:18,720
also existing scripts that you can be

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:18,720
used so yeah your provisioning part then

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:27,600
one of the major features of my practice

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:31,240
is what we call continuous discovery and

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,900
what it does is as long as it's running

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,420
it discovers symmetry all the time the

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,160
relationship between the VM and although

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,490
this is for updates so you have new

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,620
stuff coming in and give me sockets

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:48,930
connected it registers and then it

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:52,980
displays you know this UVM's or whatever

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:56,410
and it's all reflected in near real-time

00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:00,630
and we also track the data over time

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:04,150
usage data and things like that and

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:06,250
there's this thing called swathe

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,060
analysis where you can actually other

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:13,690
in-depth analysis of virtual instances

00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:17,640
so it'll just get kind of surface level

00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:20,080
information like a VM game and the

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,500
hypervisor name or whatever but you also

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,780
get details about what's running inside

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,410
like users app it was the files

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:33,490
available so smart state catches them

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,770
and the nickname of spot state of

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:40,270
leasing you know facing you

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:43,179
the sheep in kind of who like a wall and

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,830
exposed yeah whatever but without

00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:48,610
deciding the destructive manner you're

00:17:44,830 --> 00:18:00,429
not feeling you're freezing it oh yeah

00:17:48,610 --> 00:18:03,000
analogy exact okay so lifecycle issue

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,620
and I have mentioned previously detract

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,280
the virtual instances drill the whole

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:12,040
lifecycle and you can see the history

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,020
one was rotted but it was closer

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:19,780
migrated and can do that you can shut

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,940
down and suspend it and through the

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,840
lifecycle management in the Smarty

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,059
analysis you can also easily track call

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,710
that of problems because you have all

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,679
the information there you can find out

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,170
exactly what happened at this time what

00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,320
changed which might cause in alters and

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:43,170
resources to suddenly get consumed a lot

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,170
more than others and things like that so

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:53,710
and of also of performance and capacity

00:18:49,990 --> 00:19:00,670
management the utilization of resources

00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:03,070
and with which historical data you can

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:07,030
actually make them make use of them to

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:10,630
predict usage trends for new deployers

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,820
you can make the recommendations suggest

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,110
this is the optimal size state of this

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,990
scenario and configuration so and can

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:24,790
you know you won't waste resources so

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:29,160
much it is publicly important because we

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:32,260
can have policy based compliance checks

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:37,690
which is you know of the base of the

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,790
data editor smart stay analysis and for

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,710
example something like the drought

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:48,210
Muller ability from the openness

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:49,890
it is a issue last year okay

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,230
you know this travel quality checking

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,500
the version of the alternator career and

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,660
and then apply the checks to all the VM

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,750
see which one is having problems and

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,690
then a policies constructor of event

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,450
position and action like anything object

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,850
or a VA we started the back the

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,970
condition is it is running the correct

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,400
version of whatever patch or you know if

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,220
it's running the greatest part if not

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,380
maybe you generate a record and alarm

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:26,700
whatever or even you know a Joe an

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:29,970
update to satellite or something so it's

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,640
ways to it with that automatically we

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:37,410
have to you know check check on the

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:40,050
individual distance as you have so and

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,710
and to apply policies there's two ways

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:47,430
of doing that uniformly based you know

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,990
like the same root user access for all

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,740
all the different environments that I

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,530
have on my network or you can say on you

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,270
know the production environments

00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:59,250
structure file access compared to the

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:07,560
development environment so if you could

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:10,710
specify different conditions by then

00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,190
with the usage daytime stuff you can

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,460
check a level well who are using what

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:22,670
and you know a charge tracking how much

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:27,720
people using and whether this amount

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:34,230
involves and yeah you can set the cold

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:37,530
out by user relocated and then the south

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:41,630
of tracking like for confused memory

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:44,850
storage and network resources so

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:48,840
reports and track information can be

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:50,610
generated through manage IQ so all these

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,480
different features

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:57,260
resource on track

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,360
and policy based compliance check the

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:04,160
things I got can be applied to the

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,960
different platforms with traditional

00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,500
virtualization of the virtualized

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,980
environments like VMware like Microsoft

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:19,780
hyper-v like a weird which is the a34 I

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:23,750
have enterprise virtualization and cloud

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:27,020
platforms I've mentioned already

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:32,930
previously added on Google clouds

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:36,500
Microsoft Azure and nowadays the Hot

00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:41,420
Topic containers we have to say venture

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:44,360
through OpenShift and you can have about

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,060
containers anything capabilities and you

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:53,150
can make sure they're secure through

00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:59,120
open apps and make you know many share

00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:03,140
your systems through that way so that's

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,640
held a very high level features of what

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:10,850
if I could get the length and just come

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,940
early getting the service here because I

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:20,360
quite a powerful tool and I realized is

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:22,760
usually for kind of large say global

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,980
deployment of cloud systems and things

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,440
like that so we may not be for like you

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,230
know something I want at home

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,360
individually for myself but um I hope

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,640
they keep it yeah I thought people cards

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,690
later I will distribute and get more

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,390
information as well

00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:41,720
right I go more about kind of the

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,560
project the young open-source project

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,380
part with releases every single month

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:52,400
also takes runs roughly with a more

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:57,080
recent releases and l8 alphabetically I

00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:01,310
can see ABCDE is there so that tells you

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:04,010
why these are cutting and such anyone

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,670
strip strip yes in chess grandmasters

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,380
the more

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:14,330
that is taped up these are for you haha

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:17,420
yeah so this is our current stable

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:20,710
release which despite being a shortening

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,710
if I'm the most difficult to pronounce

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:32,030
everyone to you yeah it is a Dutch name

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:34,070
- Dutch chess grandmaster so yeah so but

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:37,040
the legs really the f release is called

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,980
fine so that's all the cheese's we have

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,940
either American just very magical

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,720
Rubenstein

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,370
so we have the fine release coming up

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:51,260
actually we recently had a beta release

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:54,260
out and working out of insanity so and

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,200
then we just recently voted for the Q

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,870
release let me see if I can pronounce a

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,370
couple - really it's name up a lot of

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:06,440
epic - relief with georgian chess

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:11,030
grandmaster and she served first first

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:18,470
female chess grandmaster long neighbor

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:20,750
to even fill oven and then and this is

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,420
actually what I do most of the time like

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm not so much in in the development

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,970
side of things in this project so I

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,220
organized a long event I attend event I

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,700
you know I'm usually working on the

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:37,220
scene I've started to it was seeking

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,240
opportunities and but the additional

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:45,200
designs on it last year and one of the

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,420
people and what we do for fun with hm h

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,970
actually um that's our engineering

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:54,290
director and he's an avid chess player

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:56,930
maybe explaining and he actually playing

00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:00,890
simultaneously against i9e for my

00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:04,070
players is chef final and he it have

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:10,040
also you open it nobody was able to to

00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:13,040
to defeat him now so by the way so um it

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,220
was quite quite a successful Ignace it's

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,850
because we say and it's my favorite part

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,240
of the hallway track

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:24,240
so and I realized my times actually up

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,300
to okay so you're welcome to catch me

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,840
later on and ten hallways over coffee

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,460
so upcoming events we have actually read

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,560
only coming up real soon

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,630
I'm flying back to Paris tomorrow than

00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,600
one day of breath and laundry and then

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:43,980
I'm trying to for the next day

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,300
so for those of you who might oh there

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,160
we are there for some nice chunky

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,680
doodles if not there we're both a lot

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:55,380
events I try to organize a lot of stuff

00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:56,570
here in the UT side eight here and don't

00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,520
go to thumb

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:04,850
that's going on of course all these

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,580
information you can go oh okay why was I

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,260
so I just wanted to say that in fact

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,760
creating an open-source project is not

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,220
just about code even though this is

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,820
definitely a big part of it we recently

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:22,860
had this you know we designed the mascot

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:25,290
contest and if you remember something

00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,140
about SWOT analysis and the free thing

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:31,290
you might see the correlation here so

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,090
anyway this came out the winner and then

00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:38,300
we'll probably have him and we will have

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:42,270
him making he save you at the red Tomic

00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:46,920
so how to get more information and get

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,930
in touch and well like I said I have

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,490
some evil cards then so that I just

00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,070
grabbed one so you have to remember all

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,020
these but if even if you don't know

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,520
anything you can remember bench IQ that

00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,950
all you need really because for my

00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,250
jacket on board you can you know find

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:06,750
the links to pretty much all of these of

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:08,880
course our code up in github and like I

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,210
said a gator is our kind of chat full of

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,740
