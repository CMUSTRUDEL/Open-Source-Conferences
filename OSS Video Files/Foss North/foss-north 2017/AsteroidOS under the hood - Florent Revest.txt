Publication date: 2017-04-29
Playlist: foss-north 2017
Description: 
	AsteroidOS is an open-source alternative operating system for smartwatches. It is built on embedded Linux technologies such as Qt5, BlueZ5, OpenEmbedded, PulseAudio and libhybris and currently runs on eight different models of watches.

This talk will provide a general overview of the various stacks involved in the making of Asteroid. We'll focus on several topics ranging from graphics adaptation to Bluetooth Low Energy communication. This can be seen as a global introduction to the architecture of an embedded Linux system.
