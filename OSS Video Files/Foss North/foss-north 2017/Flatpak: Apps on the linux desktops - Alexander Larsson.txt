Title: Flatpak: Apps on the linux desktops - Alexander Larsson
Publication date: 2017-05-06
Playlist: foss-north 2017
Description: 
	Have you ever wanted to run a linux application that was not packaged in your distribution, or a newer/older version that what is packaged? Was it painful? Did you fail?

Flatpak is here to help you. It is a sandboxing, distribution and deployment system for Linux desktop application that puts the power back in the hands of the application developers.
In this talk you will learn about the architecture and benefits of flatpak, and how the technologies behind it, like bubblewrap, ostree and portals work.

Alexander Larsson has worked at Red Hat the last 15 years, working on projects like Gnome, GVfs, Gtk+, and docker. Recently he has spent most of his time working on Flatpak.

	00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:08,400
right let's go

00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:11,070
Tom Allen worked Red Hat historically

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,910
importantly in the death of group size

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:19,050
okay were compel related some KGB death

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,660
Jill with Nautilus things like that but

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,769
the last say two years I've been working

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:30,330
on this project called backpack which is

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,489
basically ass on the desktop and

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,920
obviously you have applications or live

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:39,149
in a setup you can update so what I can

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:44,219
ask I mean more like the iOS Android

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:48,210
style of apps not necessarily the wolf

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:55,550
ORD part but the other aspect a classic

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:57,960
of apps so I have a couple major goals

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,359
first thing is I would cross

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,730
distribution across different versions

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,049
of disputes before the end

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,979
I want to or I want the absolute

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,640
maintainer of adapt to meet a build of

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,509
their release put it somewhere and in

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,659
everyone

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,220
many execution any version of the

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,549
distribution should be able some with it

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,729
and it should run the same it they want

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,810
is you test it is the same it's that

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,299
your users with run on any it's very day

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,340
what updated version II but this really

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,950
will keep running because it's the thing

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:44,310
that and secondly I want ten boxing

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:47,250
clearly not all going to ask what is a

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,680
be perfectly sound possible but sample

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,430
case it is a very big part of the design

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,799
so we will allow some kind of unboxing

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,100
and we also allow things to be less

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,149
sandbox but there is like a tad towards

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,290
perfect sandbox ability and then little

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:11,940
the last thing is kind of a

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:14,510
non-technical goal but I want you letter

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,210
we developer like the off-screen

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,360
application developers and their users

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:24,480
because right now if you are again and

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,460
you do a new release when your users get

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,370
a you relief

00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,020
let me have a lot of other running some

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,180
some really cool people can like that

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,550
although this horrible the doublet but

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,440
most people do get it from their

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,030
distributions and deterrent on a slowly

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,230
moving distributions they would

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,590
basically never get it

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,040
I constantly rap to a new distribution

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,560
version that I want to leave in a place

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,900
where the day after that I'll presume

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,020
your release the users will get a you

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,410
bang it assembly we report box against a

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,510
current e you know say please it will

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,530
not report engine box ever fixed two

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:08,240
years ago if they have feature requests

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:13,140
or changes and we have a currently being

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:16,710
developed and I hope you that the so

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,170
basically increase the velocity of open

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:23,010
source development which I think it's

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,840
very important making it more like say

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,820
the web environment or you can use

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:32,180
pushed off of people have it it test it

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:36,870
and fix stuff in it so shorter iteration

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,360
and it's like another goal is that it

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,240
should be a very technical experience

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,280
this is I imagine most people would be

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,709
on the you slack this particular example

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,320
is software which is ago a slower kind

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,910
of thing but this also flap back back

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,670
into the KDE app store or solar

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,740
installation thing and also couple

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,280
others we're taking Google to the same

00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,590
as become one it just has a different

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,070
packet so you click on something here

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,670
you get nice yeah you get like the

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,200
scripture knows there's reading a single

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,150
button doesn't take that back or

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,840
anything you click on it and it is also

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:27,460
there's a progress orange stuff

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:30,669
if you eat it all technical thing and

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,120
when it's in Seoul it's just part of

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:37,510
your desktop at the people to get or RVM

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,210
two years old you launch it like you

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,430
would any other app there's nothing in

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:47,280
the UI that says this thing is a fad

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,280
hacking it just looks like a mat

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,370
obviously we all have a command-line

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,380
tool we shall take back in it the hair

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,330
is basically the equivalent this up here

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,000
is equivalent to what we did before in

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,910
the UI but it's actually not going to

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,389
because baby they're going to suffer

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,180
example kind of cheated black back is

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,600
going to be decentralized

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,930
there's no we've used all pat pack

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,250
there's no app if you have to add like

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,550
if you use all the distro there's always

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,150
a default setup things you can pull the

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,919
black pack doesn't really come with a

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,520
distribution of things so you have to

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,490
add a repository so this was here dad

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,710
bingo repositories and if it was you do

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,100
that you will then all the apps they

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:43,390
will appear in your software or

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:47,860
equivalent movies all here is one major

00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:51,729
difference from how app and down with

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,910
work you have to specify the source

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,860
where we phone system whereas in a

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,320
simple division or will you just say

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,160
install this thing and we look at all

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,979
you can figure repositories but we

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,220
expect there to be like multiple remotes

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:12,940
sold much more so than in a distribution

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,880
model so there's a little trust in which

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,770
remote you pull things from like if you

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,560
sold it it shouldn't be from some third

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,300
party thing that you assault a game from

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,080
you should be getting your other apps

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,360
from them so the source of the app is

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,470
always trusted thing you only get up age

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,559
of that remote in the future and you can

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,199
run things you can get updates for it

00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:41,080
they see alternative way to install it

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,960
or you can like click on this link in a

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,080
web browser and we just install it which

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,259
is basically here small take small that

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,710
prescribes all of that the difference is

00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:56,169
that doing this will not add these votes

00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:01,930
as publicly available and they will not

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:05,550
show up in in your softer or better you

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,550
could use it updates with each one app

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:14,979
so how does this work

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:17,560
flat pack is very much as relying on

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:20,979
something called os3 how many people

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,879
know that illustrate it's not as a lot

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:28,599
it's a really designed for entire

00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:31,479
operating systems now uses historic

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,800
continued integration framework produced

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,979
like completely guilt-free

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,770
every you know we could get a TV a

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:42,159
little piece by the door on a project at

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:45,279
home beg to you Tamaki updatable

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,560
operating system and so long it just

00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,860
from the affiliate industry to use it I

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,159
think there's like you keyboard over

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:57,699
it's a particular using a tawdry but we

00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:00,459
use it for ass instead of operating

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,459
systems with it and app and operating

00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:06,459
because if they to give the same so the

00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:10,060
design is basically a straight ripoff or

00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:13,629
gate it maybe isn't being that the

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:17,310
things you normally commit is a entire

00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:20,800
truth of operating system binaries so

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:24,539
there are some small changes in how it

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,009
sorts things in the repository because

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:30,580
it is not very efficient for large

00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:33,459
binaries correctly it's very similar you

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,130
have a repository at a local repository

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:39,099
yeah branch into the remote and pull the

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,000
branch you can get a local copy of it

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:45,690
and you can check that

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,260
and in it is a heart attack every branch

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,180
and promoted to them for that so if you

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:57,920
think of a mystery remote at the get

00:08:51,180 --> 00:09:00,779
remote every branch it on the app and

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,430
there's also an extra branch which has

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:06,000
collected metadata for all the other

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,450
matches which is what we do for for the

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,800
UI and the what if you have soar thank

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:18,480
you if absolute is a Prudential format

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,450
for metadata about app from the

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,839
information screenshots all that because

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,899
of and we can take those from a crash

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,220
and create a big one when you pull that

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,279
regularly and when you have all

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,620
information and answering is already

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,850
used by at the end that over on so it's

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,550
most apps already have descriptions in

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:46,560
this format and what can be done with

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,540
the teeth grad so if you do the black

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,430
agate soul what happened is that we have

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,440
a local repository just like you're

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,270
giving kids that is a target directory

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,000
to basically a local directory or a

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,820
local repository and we pull this branch

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,230
into the local directory a deliverable

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:10,260
story and then we shake out of it

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:13,470
supervening get choice or not always

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,959
with most the time I have a dot

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,020
iterative it's always connected to a

00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,750
check out you can actually run it over

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,880
you have one variable story and check

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,899
out a different directory and that's the

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:32,130
time although we have because you a one

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,930
repository and one check out perhaps we

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,220
shake it out different directory and

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:41,279
then this one ends up in just a recruit

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,620
file and one of one of the one of the

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,200
directory called export that's a bunch

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,720
of exports that we copy and here's a

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,780
fighter rewriting on into a global

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,470
directory where we integrate with a

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:59,560
not so much people know about for the

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,610
network but that's a positive basically

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,710
how do you launch apps in the UNIX

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,980
environment and we have icons and need

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:11,140
the integration make like that and and

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:17,340
that's the way it integrates with with

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:19,270
your shell or plus more whatever and it

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,160
doesn't want to cope we get to this

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,250
there's also some very nice parts about

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,370
the design of us G first of all it's

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,010
based on the same of it which is content

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:33,850
addressed storage needing every file in

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:37,120
every app is stored by the nation based

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:40,810
on its hash of content so any two files

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,220
from any two apps or stored as long if

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,070
you have a pen constant therefore the

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:49,180
same place they're also only one on this

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,340
only one page cache and if you pull

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,650
something by the network if you already

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,290
have the objects or to available we we

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:59,920
got out of that end even it comes from

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:02,920
entirely different app and anyway they

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,390
check out the check out sweetie we're

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,030
actually hard links back into the

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:15,610
repositories we're not duplicating the

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:19,480
storage also a paper atomic Oh Street

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,610
Elton atomic basically which you fool

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,310
you download all the objects that are

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,440
just files based on the content main

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,320
picks on the content and at the end

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,410
you've changed the branch to points to

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,650
the latest tip and the same with a check

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,230
out we check out not over the currently

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,350
existing one doesn't next to it and then

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,620
we do atomic switch of a symbolic link

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,460
based atomically now whenever you run

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:51,190
this is now this one and if the old one

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,070
is currently running it kept around

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,840
under the lab business exits which is

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,710
really nice because like if you were

00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,300
ever an amount unlock this roasted

00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,690
people to the right pieces

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,730
iBooks it's great

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,980
all the time is you updating the

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,550
background pick from Google's lotta

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,110
changes and it can't handle any great

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,450
ever we started manually but that will

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,550
never happen because the old thing is

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,910
always there until the last instant

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:25,540
fills away and every new instance is

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:28,970
always put the contracted one here's a

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,510
sample of Hasek a product for our Vedic

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:35,120
trivial application let's just like a

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,140
regular directory would regular file is

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,770
here the binary and have some libraries

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,960
graduate someday apologies is it exports

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,780
in return with stuff that great and

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,670
there's a metadata file that has some

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:56,690
example this is a simple example and

00:13:51,670 --> 00:14:00,290
this here is the application of ID which

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:03,740
is basically a name of the app in a

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:08,330
diva's /f of style or converts the main

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,760
name format and all the exported file

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,830
has to have a name as pre thick so that

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:20,150
will never be any context in the global

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:23,920
namespace and then will you run this

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:26,600
thing we use container technologies I

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,590
kind of try to avoid the name container

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,840
because people tend to conflict as the

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,210
docker and server-side contain yourself

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,850
but it's using the same kernel features

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,760
and in fact it uses a program called

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,860
bubble wrap which is a product that I

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,640
kind of extracted from flat pack with a

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,950
solidity so by other people - it's more

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,460
like fruit on steroids

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:58,040
it also uses namespaces and other

00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:00,230
features converters handoff yourself the

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,680
difference between bubble wrap and root

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:08,150
is that any regular user use bubble wrap

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,640
save me to make their environment more

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,150
contained cannot be used to break out of

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,390
anything

00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,700
truth is root only because you can use

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,460
it to exploit that your do you think

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,860
that that's the perfect paper bubble

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,680
wrap so it does not this entirely

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,040
different view of the process seven so

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,910
that it the Athens has never cease to be

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,840
positive in that it whatever file to to

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,460
are always available is that hat and

00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,790
people to run time over supplies that

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:46,240
user and easy everything else is

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:50,380
invisible that there is this directory

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,880
on it it's sort and just happening the

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,740
fact that you can access it doesn't mean

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,840
you can access the events of the home

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,720
directory just this particular great

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,630
trigger which is by default the only

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,700
place you can write at least that's the

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,140
mean which is rightly template that's

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:10,290
only a ram all system the really nice

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:15,250
compared to some other systems

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:17,020
you don't need relocatable asked you can

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,810
always just build with that app predicts

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,870
and agree every app will be its own

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,420
files so every that happens infant but

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,460
the high lane is always the same which

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,110
means very easy to build typical Linux

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,680
desktop apps use configure down to the

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,950
middle prefix and they're just work if

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,350
you look at snappy for instance which is

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,120
kind of an alternative you have to like

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,700
to figure out a pirate variables to a

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,310
defined itself and weird prefixes and

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:50,970
stuff but there's always was this work

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:53,800
and then we have this egg holder runtime

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:58,270
every time is would supplies but useful

00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:01,630
when the app runs but it in very resent

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:05,650
it's like a distribution because most of

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:08,890
your distribution a since that user but

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,500
it's not a distribution in the sense

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,600
that has everything in it like there is

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,089
no innocence amount of colonel there's

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,180
no hardware support with no awake server

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,240
it only has the minimal lieutenant is

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,550
that your app is going to require and by

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,510
dependencies I mean directing

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:31,810
libraries and data files that you load

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:35,410
is like in a sentence or out might

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:38,280
depend of the observer but let's just

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:41,560
give them like see everything your app

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,780
loads of directly sorts I'll have to

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,770
gain at runtime or if it's not them in

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:50,770
on time to the app so it's much much

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,190
cooler than a distribution that's still

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,800
kind of a distribution and every

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,560
application gets to decide what version

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,110
or what the name of the runtime you want

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,640
to use this and what version it is so

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,380
they can be multiple rockets in Seoul

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,680
however nine you want and they can be

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:15,340
multiple use parallel even fifty one

00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:17,830
literally isolated and the runtimes are

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,410
also basically the same that the app it

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,870
is fly buzzing pushes it down that

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:26,410
exports because you don't typically run

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:29,050
either a clean but in another example is

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,660
poking us around the another word thing

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:35,890
it has bitsy and some general eggs over

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:39,130
yourself but typically you have also

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:45,430
have as we totally desktops up a bunch

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:52,390
of data cows I can maybe hear all help

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:56,160
dogs and monsters internet others and

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,160
libraries that you also are gonna need

00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,890
in fact it's almost certainly there's a

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,930
bit team which also probably and it

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:09,520
depends on the runtime it's probably

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:12,460
also your typical shell tooling but this

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,140
pet on Iranian scrap binary things that

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:20,010
make health work ethic library what

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:26,590
would be an x5 arisen of India libraries

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:29,470
but also and this is one of the major

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,170
reasons of giving the split everything

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,840
that security sensitive

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:37,330
shoot ID AP and need time so we can

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:43,390
update it separately so

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:46,880
crypto libraries codex English loaders

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:51,290
compression libraries file format

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,040
parsers all the things that intend to

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,820
attack weird dogs that effect networking

00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,000
communication some things like that

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,020
shoot to be the runtime because then app

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,460
developers if anything is not there on

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,850
time you have to bundle it with a hat

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,370
and you don't want the app developers to

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,100
be responsible for organizers El Dorado

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,980
or something like that so that's a huge

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,460
part of why we have the runtime using

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:22,340
clicked in fact I think it's important

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,680
to talk about or the runtime is and it's

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,830
not because a lot of people have a

00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,690
tendency to think of everything in terms

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,860
of distribution packages and

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,870
distribution package is fundamentally

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:40,520
complete different from the derogatory a

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:43,970
split package dependencies are created

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,920
for technical reasons where you want to

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,620
install an app and you need a general

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,550
set of the penalties but the runtime is

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:56,720
not a minimal type of line division in

00:20:52,550 --> 00:21:00,080
some sense it's like a maximum set of

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,440
dependencies things you see as important

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:08,090
core and you will always get all of that

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:11,510
the reason is that is it's a structural

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:14,230
organizational change so that two sets

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:19,040
of people can work on the same thing or

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:22,460
ribbon the same separately like one team

00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,730
can maintain a runtime and not have

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:30,290
every app developer has to do security

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:32,890
update internet that so don't like try

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:38,330
to create your own runtime basically

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:41,570
unless you're a major competing or lucky

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,210
major organization that can take on the

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:47,020
burden of the maintainer of essentially

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,020
a distribution

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,440
as an app developer you have to then

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,630
pick a ton time and the doesn't on

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,170
project who knows exactly what will

00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,110
happen

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,300
I hope it will not be a multitude of

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,840
runtimes it gets like I mean we could

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:08,620
use the whole distribution fragmentation

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,740
system I want the distribution to focus

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:15,070
on the operating system since what

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,590
they're good at and like have a minimal

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:21,250
set of dependencies or the rather in

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,850
order to run times we generally turns

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:29,110
out there two kinds of runtimes once

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,440
they are kind of minimal which ye being

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:35,590
evil you can kind of make them

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,150
supportable over a long time we have one

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,870
called the three days up Club work on

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,480
time and as you can get on the name it

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:49,380
has both of the stuff from PS also this

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:51,610
X in there Nita Jeep dreamer Kiba

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,540
there's also some game stuff in there

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:59,500
like FTL and hopeful you the really core

00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:03,130
does not stop that can be stable of a

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:06,130
long time who can it supported a long

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:10,620
time but and that might need to bundle

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:13,900
war on top of this let's all map stone

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,450
this is a great like use case for a game

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:20,790
doesn't have a lot of dependencies or

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:24,070
you know Maya or some third-party

00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:28,480
proprietary app but don't use the latest

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:32,260
and greatest result Roku kids and then

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:36,700
we have the launcher run times PD is

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:39,610
doing a runtime dome at the runtime and

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,160
it's unclear exactly how the ke one will

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,620
work but they don't on and one revs

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,590
every six months with a major releases

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:52,330
of the be you know close to turn of you

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:54,930
runtime which is fine because most young

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,130
apps also polls

00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,680
whatever heat I don't think Avenue to

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,710
penetrate immediately later so even

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,789
though we cannot support

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:07,309
no sometimes longer than like a couple

00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:09,080
of years or something most Apple

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,080
probably follow and keep using the

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,850
latest one especially since it's free to

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,159
like you can read your dependencies

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,490
without forcing your users to operated

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,950
distribution as much simpler to update

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:25,640
zero dependencies because if you don't

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,860
have to have any like minimal

00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,779
dependencies that is it because it has a

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,539
we're going to digital you can use take

00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:35,690
the latest one make sure it works and it

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:39,080
will work for everyone it's also a

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,059
different kind of runtimes that we have

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,809
been experimenting with like express the

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:47,149
things adora you think about rebuilding

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:51,950
all our current packages or these like a

00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:54,830
subset of them as flat tax and then we

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,370
basically have to pick some subset of

00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:00,200
fedora and make that at one time and

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:03,169
then whatever other dependencies your

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,390
app has has to go with the app but

00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:08,690
that's not I came up run time that you

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:13,880
want the report apps to rely on it's a

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:20,570
way to repackage existing packages and

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:25,130
then we have some boxing Linux and UNIX

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:28,669
has the still evolve as secure and I

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:31,880
guess it's true in some sense with the

00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:33,649
security model of the threat model it

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,070
stays on is different from what you

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:40,190
really need intensive environment it's

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:43,100
great if you have a shared workstation

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:50,899
and University lab or at shirts sort of

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:56,840
server in a what a university or project

00:25:50,899 --> 00:26:00,820
in company but on my machine I am the

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,940
only user I root it doesn't really help

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:07,279
to protect the machine from anything the

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,860
really important stuff on my machine is

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,820
in my home directory and everything Iran

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,180
in

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:18,410
in my session has blue access to that so

00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:22,100
if I run a game it can impersonate me on

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:25,880
Facebook it can be my navel it can put

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:31,370
her in my name between my name it it

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:34,940
just a degree has no use of this protect

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:39,140
root against my UID just doesn't affect

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,510
anything so we want to have a way to pay

00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,740
2 gauge juice another layer inside the

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,970
run extension where we can isolate

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:54,080
asking each other and apps from my files

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:56,300
and my our data basically so this is

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,100
essentially important that is in the

00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,950
plan time level we are likely to have

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,790
multiple third-party people delivering

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:08,150
the app use so we eat captain's have

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:12,110
less trust in the sources of software

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:15,740
download negative you if you run any

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:18,290
distribution you 100% trust anything

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,830
that you because you automatically

00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:24,710
download packages that run script as

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:27,830
routes in the background on your machine

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:30,800
but we can't have that if we use add a

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,860
remote from some game developer that's a

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,860
new cool thing we cannot give them that

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,100
kind of level of trust that we don't

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:43,310
want ever run arbitrary code long time

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,580
box inside that doing information we

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:48,950
want to have after don't like e

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,160
intermingle or conflict with existing

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,010
files you can just delete the app and

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,270
it's gone forever

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,730
and we want the ability to do things

00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:03,230
like you not let it

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:07,670
what set a or you networking access at

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:11,840
all if you do this we use any

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:13,820
technologies with namespaces pauses and

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,000
namespace is a ton of everyone that lets

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,879
us rearrange to view the file system but

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,099
there's also other ones like user

00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:25,940
you're in a state is where we can see

00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:27,769
make it not the other young users with

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:33,919
the pig one that makes it not the other

00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:38,299
processes they say I see one that does

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,279
not like it's all chef every and every

00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,399
answers inside about you see different

00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,159
stuff and also never gain stages that is

00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:51,679
isolate the network and someone happy'

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:54,019
other e not very well-known the type of

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,339
black called peer set no new prints

00:28:54,019 --> 00:29:02,269
which is the basics of having a route

00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:06,529
like thing easy but truth it can't be

00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:10,159
Ruta Lee it is placed with the pops of

00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:13,099
you and some said you a league or

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,619
otherwise trust the things trust that a

00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:20,449
bagel gives a head see it's actually DSP

00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:23,389
pepper not something hoo-wee so once we

00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:26,029
set the flag we can never ever did any

00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:28,459
increase the privileges if basically

00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:30,339
make said you're here working or

00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:32,809
anything like that

00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:38,809
we will do second justice disco

00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:41,119
filtering to remove P trainees weird

00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:46,969
Network things that nobody should use

00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:49,879
but had had problems it has and it curve

00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:52,339
is the table by default some other

00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:54,789
things that are you likely to perform

00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:58,339
attic and unlikely to ever be used

00:29:54,789 --> 00:30:01,639
actually a DJ this case to the muggings

00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:04,069
who can optionally enable it but unequal

00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:06,619
it's not there it will be things are

00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:10,879
hard use in a non

00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:13,309
privileged that up so we kind of use it

00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:15,979
in the abscess to be use running in the

00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:19,399
user session but not me any nothing is

00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:21,889
really designed around three groups I'm

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,659
hoping that the next generation see

00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:29,889
group work success that that seems to be

00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,889
always somewhere in the future

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:39,920
so given that we can basically do

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:42,610
nothing how do you do something first of

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,660
all you can like it statically request I

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,720
don't want to give it to do more things

00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,960
but the app can and it's not a test to

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,880
take anyone never cactus and in your

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,760
soul I mean currently we used all we

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,190
control eventually we want to add it

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,870
right now those ABS are not really

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,720
sandbox but initially we want to have an

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:06,470
Android like Angry if you install this

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,640
app it will require these privileges and

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:13,580
you can choose not a soul or you can

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,920
override the position but and probably

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,650
the pain might not work all the

00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:24,260
infrastructure that to do all this it is

00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,380
not shown in the UI right now in great

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:31,160
weight as you can request that to the

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:33,740
network over DL and be out of speedy

00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:38,440
users home directory or all the files I

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:42,680
want to get it to show you ourselves or

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:45,500
show the pretty sounds I get at my

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,850
client put it actually always access the

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:52,160
diva or we have around just drink the

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,590
boss proxy so the default access for the

00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,130
boss is very limited you can own your

00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:59,390
name so that others control to you but

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:03,020
by equals you can't really talk to

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:08,150
anyone else you can request access to

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:11,720
specific services on the boss and I

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:15,410
think this is pretty much the old style

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,170
Android model which is necessary for

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:21,440
sometimes because somebody thinks has to

00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:26,030
be set up but before the app in the

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:29,390
store but in the future we want to move

00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:36,230
to more generic order using some paper

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:40,279
called portals portals which is the name

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:43,039
what we mean by portal is a service

00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:46,460
abundant in your session meaning that

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,940
it's not sandbox system trust the

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:54,860
service that your handbook applications

00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:58,490
are allowed to talk to so super get it

00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:00,799
I've using the current setup using debug

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,610
to talk to it but kind of it could be

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,039
something else

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:07,130
the important thing is that this has a

00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,610
small interface to it and we need to

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:14,960
face only explosive things that we are

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:23,750
eating as safe in like some kind of high

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:26,500
level typically they are safe because

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:30,710
they use some kind of user interaction

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:34,760
 do an example we have a file

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:36,940
chooser portal the Hat wouldn't normally

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,830
have access to the user's home directory

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,450
but let's if it's say a PDF viewer

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:45,710
that's kind of because you want to

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:48,039
actually be able to show up again so we

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:51,919
then have it mulch is affordable and it

00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:54,529
app the mulch is portable to let the

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,559
user pick a file and then the user picks

00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:59,210
a file from the portal and the portal is

00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,679
not sandbox so you can see all your

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:05,710
files let's be at the MU or cannot

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,990
exceed immortal don't work or control it

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:13,369
the outside of the app upon its Houston

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:16,429
and like you click OK and implicitly

00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:18,220
grant privileges to your app you're not

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,889
allowed to read this one file

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:24,980
anyway I'm headed back to the app and

00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,869
you can read it and depending on one of

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,450
them what it wants you we can probably

00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:32,530
eat it save a new version of it and

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:40,550
stuff it only that file and nothing else

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:44,119
and this is secure because a the user is

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:46,429
probably not gonna like randomly select

00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,800
an important file that he didn't want to

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,280
expose

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:54,399
and B if it's an app worth users to try

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,360
to attack the user it will like to show

00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,910
you a modular what you didn't expect it

00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,500
to and the file chooser if you don't

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,900
want it you can always close it so

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:11,580
there's always like a way you can fold

00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:15,180
the interactive operation that plus the

00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:19,330
fact that you won't be choosing any

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:22,260
problematic files makes it safe from the

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:26,380
point of your at least and the other way

00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,880
for the portal can always tell who's

00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,040
doing the request like what hat is

00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,470
actually requesting that it needs to

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:38,410
have a list of things or the white list

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:42,060
and pee-yew position portal searching

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:45,400
look at the whole gap and say this app I

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,260
was configuring in if I didn't desktop

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,869
or something that this particular app

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,090
can get my mind right position the other

00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:54,430
app gives you a coarse-grained position

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,890
and if you can't see anything you can

00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:00,700
always report that we don't currently

00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,050
know all the decision but the data you

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,760
get from the portal depends on your

00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:09,070
permissions but they interpreted such as

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,840
AIDS because you know this probably a UI

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,560
in the control center somewhere where

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,619
you can grant individual apps different

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:22,060
operations that way you can expand

00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:24,670
examine what type of thousand you now we

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:30,280
have a currently a small set of worlds

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:34,690
and it's not a lot it actually is

00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,280
mostly what as me so there is there is a

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,730
goal and thank all the doctors portal

00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,010
widgets so infrastructures to let you do

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:44,770
the per per app per file permission

00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:48,280
check whether the global venues by the

00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:52,720
politics portal there's also a show you

00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,630
rifle which means if you have the ball

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,970
dialogue and you click on that

00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,529
but a link to your homepage you want

00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:02,339
over the browser but you don't want to

00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:05,640
fumble a browse through your app so you

00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:08,269
want to use the person 1 but you cannot

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,839
see the system so it's kind of a way to

00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:16,549
open up that and you always get a dialog

00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:19,859
with this this app wants to show this

00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:21,960
but around what what what web browser

00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:26,130
you want to use something like 1 and

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,250
then I think take a note back and

00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:31,109
actually after wild remembers so

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,539
initially you have to like always take

00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:36,599
something like ink after a while is that

00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:38,789
you've just always open that URL it will

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,609
create portal so you can print through

00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:42,960
the print dialog outside of the app

00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:45,059
meaning the app doesn't see the little

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,480
printer it doesn't talk to the creditor

00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:51,539
name it's just what the dialogue runs

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,640
outside of it and in the end it just

00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:58,640
like produces a PS and the other side

00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:01,829
print the network status for basically

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,700
whenever management that is proxy

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:07,829
configuration and you basically look at

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,440
the apps permission so that you have

00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:14,970
network access to discuss them if that

00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:19,319
extra layer the Dental Board itself is a

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,829
non UI but they are back in 130km on

00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:22,859
Katie

00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:25,410
I think the kd1 actually books merged

00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:30,240
into plus another like this week or

00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:31,710
something depending on what does if

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,430
you're running it just experience

00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,829
current one

00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:40,849
so atom ant activist you should be

00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:44,789
getting hated my decimated purchasers

00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:48,769
this might be Isis on others might be

00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,769
more handsome or its offset

00:38:50,100 --> 00:39:00,780
I think I can have time to talk about

00:38:54,090 --> 00:39:02,670
this so building app since that packages

00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,460
like directories and files if you have a

00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,280
binary you can use put it there and

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,430
commit the thing to an app but a more

00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,290
typical way is to build the app inside

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:18,050
flat pack itself so every runtime is

00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:20,780
paired with a runtime called the SDK

00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,920
which is all the files in the runtime

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,610
once the tooling you need to borrow

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,760
builds up against that runtime so it has

00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:33,510
a compiler and whatever tools over the

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,020
headers II like that Ethel Skimlinks and

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:40,590
all the stuffs of begin to editable

00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:43,350
packets registro for everything in the

00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,570
runtime controlling the real packages in

00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:49,050
the density and then we have this

00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:52,470
command called static build which it's

00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:54,120
like slapping run but it wants to be at

00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,700
the key and it doesn't have to be an

00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,650
installed app you like you basically

00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,920
create an empty directory where your

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,870
slash app and then it runs something in

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,070
there and you can just make in Seoul and

00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:10,800
it will end up in that directory that's

00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:13,200
kind of the very low level and then we

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,160
have a higher level Applejack builder

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,550
that they could be a layer above this

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,680
that makes easier to pack us up so you

00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,110
have a gate anion

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,000
starting today open like some global

00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:30,180
properties in little little modules that

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,990
you as you need available and it adds

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,810
extra features it's like automatic

00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,880
downloads verifies exons for your

00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:42,150
sources

00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,820
it has a cache if you change something

00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,530
at my module we would want rebuild

00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,000
everything at that point

00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:53,010
it runs in like a heavy sandbox in my

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,760
room and so anything on your build

00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,530
machine will not affect the Delta so you

00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,770
get my clean built but equal

00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:06,870
it wasn't built a specific pretext that

00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:09,270
hosts independent so it's excited like

00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,430
the pr2 top director here and it runs

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,080
make there's a hold of Pat names and

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,940
stuff that it's embedded in your files

00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:20,940
or the same no matter what your goal is

00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,040
automatically creates the park extra

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,190
things you can solve for the bottom of

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:34,050
how information has some buildings and

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:36,800
I'll attach support any age item using

00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:39,270
is not a perfect platformer coincidence

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,690
pretty simple to use this is an example

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:46,860
the building again character things up

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:51,420
on the platform with investigate but

00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:53,310
this runtime version at the end we want

00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,570
to grant access to the Exile Delta we

00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:59,190
can pokédex and want to build all the

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,570
binary system be done with everything we

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,670
can just get rid of all the static

00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:06,750
libraries and experience files ourselves

00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:15,810
and then the module can come a separate

00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:18,570
page ad is sent by Russian sources check

00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:21,330
sums for them isn't will verify them and

00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,440
if you are a bit like a typical autofill

00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,130
you don't really need to specify

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,670
anything like this here you have an

00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:32,190
extra cleanup or apparently that module

00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:36,210
for the binary we all need to be delete

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:40,860
all the binders from that that module we

00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:43,080
need to make the figuration options if

00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,600
you're building more complicated you can

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:50,580
add more sources and patches and you

00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:53,760
know posts or snippets that you're on as

00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:57,120
your builder or not let's take a get

00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:01,680
prison for then your list of things to

00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,690
build and we're starting to get a lot of

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,190
traction

00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:10,140
most major diffusions now hit the

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:11,810
backpack even like a bun to have less

00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,480
later table that

00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:17,660
in the previous release and also that

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,200
you want that is been awesome we cannot

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,430
yet in valve we hope you to Aaron soon

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,670
but there's a copper if you want it so

00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:29,420
it's on the side KDE and Gnome are

00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:33,080
interested with a company called edge of

00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:37,520
mobile it does an entire their own like

00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:40,400
in third world and cheap computer Bank

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:45,110
which is entirely based on patent troll

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:48,020
the apps and os3 for the entire olace be

00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:52,510
brought into the show that exported

00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:56,380
releases memories do you the Amano

00:43:52,510 --> 00:44:01,370
branch of networks of users multi port

00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:04,610
it is all the latest and from there

00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,290
being where has it ridiculous we're

00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:12,500
currently for working on a thing called

00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:15,200
fat hog which is meant to I think it's

00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,650
an advantage that laptop is entirely

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,500
decentralized but at the user it's not

00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,200
necessarily a good user experience to

00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,240
install it and then not have anything

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,460
use it for okay I will find all the

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,460
difference we're all sorry so we're

00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:37,130
creating like a 1 by 8 flat however we

00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:39,800
hope that most upstream at a opus or the

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:42,820
apps 11 should be there so you can bug

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,080
evil to have something that you can add

00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:50,540
one remote and have everything in your

00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:53,630
UI 63 install and you tournament be we

00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:56,630
want it's possible the actual up streams

00:44:53,630 --> 00:45:00,500
of the individual projects to maintain

00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:04,000
their app in there rather than like this

00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,000
being another distribution

00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:13,760
are you through basically four to ten

00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,760
minutes of questions

00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:34,880
any question and it's become application

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:40,680
Lee of sibling at it'll give me a cue

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:47,039
screen work words old that's the package

00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:49,440
and Orey a does not be UI framework like

00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,380
that the book there most of the condoms

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,770
it feels like yeah and quite a lot of a

00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,859
shared objects under and doctor and

00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,190
being packaged together with a

00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:03,599
graduation

00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:06,780
yeah maybe here the wrong time say it

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,650
was asleep see on the tiny hamlet enemy

00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,960
home one to the government we do have

00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:17,150
entire gtk sack and you could depend on

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,230
the ke runtime even if you only use QT

00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:22,049
because you know even though you're not

00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:25,410
using it many of your users might

00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:29,940
perhaps Katie absence also it also to

00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:34,890
keep a large part of ke Simpson side but

00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:38,309
the other hand cubes like designed to

00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:40,589
most attempt to be fun good apps there's

00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:44,400
only if you build your own duty that

00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:47,480
only the teachers you want and you know

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,150
it's exactly the immersion intensity and

00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,789
it happy individual developer to pick

00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,890
however I can have packets at behind

00:46:53,789 --> 00:47:00,150
that backup Spotify and like clearly

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:04,440
that into duty but a learning to be a to

00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:07,380
appear on pot yeah or maybe the QTE

00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,770
packages are better off helping the

00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,930
Katie runtime you good for this company

00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,299
yeah I'm going to me right now or that's

00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:19,529
up years to be they're going to be like

00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:23,099
at minimum q1 theory yes that's but I

00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:29,369
think for regular Linux that's about it

00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:30,990
was probably a better it's kyookie q gas

00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:33,960
did rely on Katie

00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:39,420
time there's less overhead of

00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:42,000
maintaining two pegs and runtimes

00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,300
dependent on money no this is meant to

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,030
be celibate yeah well there's nothing

00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:54,410
called extensions where you can sort of

00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:54,410
add to runtime so we have like a

00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:01,190
extension point in the run time for a GL

00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:05,280
driver you can sort of replace the GL

00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:11,070
you have to do because that's how over

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:13,470
here trying to work in Linux and also we

00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:16,380
have our comfort zone SDK extensions

00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:19,770
region instead of having to do an entire

00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,390
new SDK because you need a rest compiler

00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:24,300
and it doesn't have a rough compiler you

00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:29,190
can sort of add one on the side and it

00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:33,480
appears inside or next to there on time

00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:36,210
but there's no it's not a packaging

00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:41,670
system doesn't have a dag of

00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:43,710
dependencies and Ruth worth over and all

00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,720
that they believe in to the other but

00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,550
you said that the doors if you're

00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:51,660
looking at that at MIT hasn't cut back

00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:53,550
in packaging fedora so in order to cause

00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,130
basically a minimal distribution just

00:48:53,550 --> 00:49:00,450
this main defensive subsystem work and I

00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:03,780
mean that's a tricky question what the

00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:07,200
door one is very much for keeping Oh

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:10,200
Endora are interested in I think the

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,660
current side is first of all to put this

00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,630
test that make sure it works and showing

00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,010
support so it's possible to use it but I

00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,850
think eventually and I think all

00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:22,440
developers better

00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:23,970
it's kind of up to each package owner to

00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:31,080
define how they want the stuff to be

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:33,680
packaged so I think them so then that we

00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,680
can all rise

00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:50,950
okay very good

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:54,880
okay I think the personal so so in

00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:57,339
Fedora anthem and as with the with many

00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,660
distributions there's lots of different

00:49:57,339 --> 00:50:03,250
stakeholders and people who actually

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:05,470
work on Pandora and we have one group

00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:08,890
called Laura workstation group that puts

00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:11,530
together like the Philip Doradus of

00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:14,470
distribution and in there we are

00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:16,270
planning on that on having a thank you

00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:20,260
basically only shipping to the base

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:24,760
operating system in one format and then

00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:27,670
having all apps in flat back so so

00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,829
basically just taking all the Dora rpms

00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:33,550
and repeating everything as flat packs

00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:36,280
and having them a side by side for a

00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:38,290
while and see how it works out and I

00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,799
guess depends on how well it works out

00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:43,390
it we will see it like the whole plan or

00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:48,549
branch present fix the software

00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:49,809
announcements it's the short yeah and I

00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:52,089
think this is interesting because I

00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:56,619
think I think that's hard ecosystem is

00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:59,290
all wrong which is the distribution

00:50:56,619 --> 00:51:02,640
switch focus on what a you bear which is

00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:04,960
provide a operating system which is like

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,799
but that's how it's what you boot into

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,770
what you log into it should not be about

00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:14,380
how many third-party apps united's

00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:16,900
packets but right now it is like someone

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,790
else to make a great operating system if

00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,460
you still watch it snore or Debbie

00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:26,260
applicants the one half you want is not

00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:32,589
packaged in it and I think the focus

00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:34,750
should be more on making the experience

00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:37,390
of running your operation serval

00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:40,480
maintaining answer getting update for it

00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,830
should be what dispute is focus on well

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,750
how many

00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,960
we bumper apps you can packaging your

00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:50,140
repository but if all those could be

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,460
shared between the divisions the

00:51:50,140 --> 00:52:01,240
distribution could focus on the

00:51:51,460 --> 00:52:02,170
important stuff not happening crap I get

00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,150
to have to repeat the question one

00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:12,910
yea-long survivors will give us a stick

00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:21,970
top thing or also for service so I mean

00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:24,490
if we got back into oh yes because the

00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:29,470
desktop for me or Cooper for service

00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:33,310
stuff like it sneaky possible to run

00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:35,320
whatever at the flat tire but it's

00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:38,290
really designed for that out that

00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,090
there's no I would not recommend using

00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:43,030
it for for a patchy or something like

00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:46,300
that you might work for a keep smoking

00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:50,550
then I beg again running it has done

00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:53,260
have all the infrastructure around

00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:57,640
silver stuff the doctor has like there's

00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:59,980
no the network setup is really I do get

00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,080
full night protectors or no never access

00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:05,440
there's none of the magic finding of

00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:09,700
ports and exposing port connecting up

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,580
the containers there's no tracking of

00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:17,460
the currently running containers they

00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:20,800
keep yeah think about it

00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:25,030
anything we that author organizing

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:29,080
people run that of something doctor but

00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:32,980
it's a poor fit and think wait for

00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,090
running service up in packaging the

00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:39,880
comment to that

00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:42,390
so who never really work well again I

00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,390
don't know because

00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:52,180
then so in order to correctly navigation

00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:54,190
as to specify what runtime they want and

00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,130
what version but the point of the

00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:59,609
runtime to be able to update oh

00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:04,839
navigation and I version any kind of

00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:07,869
major version well like you say I want

00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:13,359
to know 3:22 but if there's a security

00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:19,390
issuing mv-22 so you visa 320 2.1 okay a

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:22,420
GI compatible update you get that but

00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:28,770
you can't look like three twenty two or

00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:28,770
three 324 any with two strings of okay

00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:38,849
so it's in support come to so again here

00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:42,640
another in sport which is really just

00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:46,510
how old at one time is configured so you

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:50,470
can be installed time EGA and I can

00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:53,470
beams as a separate entity and you slap

00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:59,040
against all doesn't that theme there's

00:54:53,470 --> 00:55:02,050
also some supports where the host

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,430
operating system inject the proteins

00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:09,670
into it in the same way but still some

00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:13,990
stuff that needs to be done for it work

00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:17,530
perfectly but we probably work in no

00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:20,380
software or equivalent to automatically

00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:23,260
install the matching being that you

00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:26,140
already have running on your desktop but

00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:30,700
yeah we're moving towards have that

00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:33,130
fully automatic like we fold the over

00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:35,080
here fiber solution where it kind of

00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:38,580
detects automatically what deal driver

00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:42,550
you have an insult the right one and by

00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:45,339
right 1wb ship and then time on

00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:48,060
certainly and then we have support for

00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:48,060
the invasion on subversion

00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,730
I'm question about what fits into what's

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,340
supposed to fit into a flat back and

00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,440
what's supposed to be in runtime for

00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:07,210
example if I perform to have the flat

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,610
package if I'm just appropriate a Perl

00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:12,710
interpreter and then I have an app that

00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:16,340
depends on the Perl interpreter do I

00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:18,380
have time can one flat pocket and

00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,780
Lenore's are fossils no no you would

00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:24,790
have to bundle them actually like in

00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:27,470
this is power common is that you have a

00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,830
framework you wanna depend on from what

00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:34,430
elapsed is a really common one in

00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:40,940
electrons like all this apps bundle

00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:43,010
electron is like the chrome and a good

00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:47,180
night that's about using chrome with no

00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:48,980
chrome and in the way you don't want to

00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,740
do that is by having a chrome or an

00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:55,790
electron one time because then that one

00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:59,390
time we need to require to do update and

00:56:55,790 --> 00:57:03,710
G would seem or not so if we instead is

00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:06,100
there is a if you create an app with

00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:10,130
electron in it and they can sort of

00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:12,620
derive from that app and add yourself on

00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:15,760
track so I'm the dependency on the

00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,950
Builder level the produced thing will be

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,290
independent

00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:25,790
okay so if I look at one way of doing it

00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:32,500
okay I can't think of a good pull up

00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:32,500
Christine so yeah absolutely lapis

00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:39,710
okay no no question well just to follow

00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:42,980
up on the last one so what about linen

00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:45,710
standard space essentially it says every

00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:48,380
his girl must have pearl concept by bun

00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:51,799
enough if you get you what's a source of

00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,809
 yeah so nobody were in the air any

00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:56,539
relationship boards that's an easy

00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:59,839
definitely need a runtime that it's plea

00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:00,799
of the rabble or just them will eat tend

00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,359
to be ancient

00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,730
I just mean a little what's here is own

00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:06,829
assuming is once per love this person

00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:11,000
along gap where does that be long

00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:12,950
then I'm growing here and now right now

00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,680
I think it might not be you have it's

00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:18,130
not in there it is in the education like

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,829
heard is really really common in bills

00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:25,880
like scripts when you goes up but it's

00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:31,640
not currently in the final run time so

00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:33,650
you have to bundle that I think that is

00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:38,019
the correct position but it does make it

00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:41,150
more painful to run or to build per lap

00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:43,190
will that mean that will be ten

00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:51,019
different instances of Poland from

00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:57,859
several yeah you take your cupcakes you

00:58:51,019 --> 00:59:00,619
forget period I guess shut up yeah there

00:58:57,859 --> 00:59:03,859
is a the line has to be drawn something

00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:06,500
somewhere and if we hanging on either

00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:09,440
side like if you put too much in the run

00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:12,049
times on the run time comes towards you

00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,869
want to maintain and stuff that very few

00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:17,869
users use will be in there and any too

00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:22,700
little in it it becomes much pain for

00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:24,920
app developer so right now we have kind

00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,990
of an arbitrary line that needs at at

00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,079
some point I think the future will tell

00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:36,230
exactly if something should move into it

00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:39,440
rabbit and I think we hope to instead

00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:43,140
make easier the build site but they made

00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:47,789
it swing easy to bundle things

00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:53,960
and hopefully it's tooling is right

00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:59,849
everything is built are reproducible

00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:02,009
enough then a politic reproduce what by

00:59:59,849 --> 01:00:03,749
Yuri tentacle files basically and then

01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:08,539
you can automatically duplication and

01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:08,539
