Description: 
	Innovation is hot! To say the least. And extremely important for Sweden in an ever increasing global competition. But what factors are truly relevant when it comes to create the right conditions for innovation?

This talk will paint the picture of a softer perspective of software innovation. With a model built on research in motivation, organization and innovation, perspectives as culture, team and values are highlighted as truly crucial.

His own company, CaptureInnovation, is built on this research, in a manager-free and innovative environment. Lessons learned, from four years of running an innovation-centered company without hierarchy, driven by individual motivators, are shared.
