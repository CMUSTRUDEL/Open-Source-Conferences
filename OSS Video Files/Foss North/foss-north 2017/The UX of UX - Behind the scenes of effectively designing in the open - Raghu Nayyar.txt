Title: The UX of UX - Behind the scenes of effectively designing in the open - Raghu Nayyar
Publication date: 2017-05-05

Description: 
	Open source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the people building open source software are engineers with major turn on for features and more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source projects have rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with. This talk aims to deal with this problem of designing in the open which is often neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually become an arena for usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it follows an effective design process. This talk is also a practical guide for budding designers to get started with open source software.

Ragy Nayyar, 23, is a post graduate student in Interaction Design at KTH, Stockholm. Prior to this he has worked, both as a designer and a developer for both big companies and startups for around 2 years. He has been a contributor to open source since he started writing code and majority of my contributions are related to front-end programming and user experience decisions. He started contributing to ownCloud when they were not even on GitHub, but on Gitorious and now its one of the highest contributed PHP project on Github. He does pretty much the same thing at Nextcloud now in his free time. He co-authored and designed the Nextcloud and ownCloud calendar which is one of the most famous self hosted calendar solutions. He loves writing CSS and building scalable CSS architectures.

again yes 16-second say yes before

00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,349
starting the bottle us up do it

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,160
so basically definitely everyone I

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:29,490
started working on open source to

00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,260
approximately five and pretty much when

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,890
I started programming excellent

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,329
I mean my first comics the code was on

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,640
an open source project so I also don't

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,620
like that obtain the foundation

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,239
happening from euphoria stage if you

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,989
have to know Hitler and all those

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,190
tentacles

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,530
well my I am from spire rebel I am an

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,230
interaction design spoon in Stockholm I

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,230
also have a huge huge open source panel

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,120
ever said and just talking about the

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,510
user experience of greatly building

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,640
great user experiences what goes behind

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,580
the scenes because I mean every now

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,610
there is a very desirous I speak open

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,180
source be super engineering heavy so it

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,250
is not a focuses and how as a developer

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,950
you can get more designers you can go

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,290
get more content my personal board so

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,860
before is that so normal people here

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,640
maintain repositories on on whichever

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,090
platform

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,770
can I have how many people actually need

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,340
to diners you guys have enough time

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:44,670
finding designer in open source view so

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:46,680
yeah we do yeah so we have to slap on

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,350
call the Volkl Sol to dialogue man which

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,340
I am being a part of since some like

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,469
knowed BFO boon SRC

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,270
on Twitter basically we are a bunch of

00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:57,579
cool designers we are a lot of different

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,009
with young voters to sleep in 2013

00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:02,500
awesome I'll be more on open source

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,270
projects we have a job posting so if you

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,189
guys are having open source project

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,019
which needs such as officially open

00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,450
source design lab they can go ahead and

00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,730
post your job openings over there you'll

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,530
probably have a have a look at that so

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,370
I'd like to throw me the easiest way to

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,319
get designers for your project so yeah

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,180
talking about open source how do you get

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,880
designed to target people who do not

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,980
write code on voted on hold it with your

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,290
subject the easiest way to do is

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:34,150
basically more document now that means

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,040
more welcoming I'm not saying by be more

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,110
welcoming I do not say a friend back to

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,150
me means yes that's important reminding

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,019
IRC that's important what am I to say

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,950
there is unique you need to document

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,049
conservation guys where the contribution

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,720
guidelines Dixit either leave me page or

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,579
something which people which people can

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,250
read which does not contain code which

00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:56,560
contain your projects team shots which

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,239
describe your project 3d review well

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,970
subscribe what the product does which

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,130
has tiny little features and the most

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,380
importantly the developers I'll tell the

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,120
lot of MSL aftermath the more trying to

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,799
dictate for anyone who doesn't know how

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,420
to program to get one motor with that so

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,400
you got a minute guys that as well we

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,150
shipping a hit that commentator baby to

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,340
talk to it you can pick the effectively

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,599
since this is a principle which has got

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,970
me in a rich fish I read a lot while I

00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,370
was contributing to key Dux they are

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,720
solid meaty pages and solid application

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,040
over here the dying language is

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,919
everything everything is very very

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,069
implies very well not amended but this

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,380
is kind of underused in small smaller

00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,120
open-source projects regarding a lot of

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,150
people are you aware the haven't given

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,079
up and the platform sense all have a

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,910
option to have any so I have so people

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,849
don't read into that so it's a good idea

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,630
to keep the VP's updates or that sort

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,490
just another

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,400
that is having your products or they're

00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:00,040
having your style marry have your future

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,140
related and what better if every team

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:08,680
that's always a luminous always a good

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:11,020
idea you have issues I've ever started

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,940
working in PDE back in the data there's

00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,830
there was no get a Vista there is

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,620
something which got me hooked on to it

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,360
that's it what actually to desire less

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,570
junior job stays to the partners of

00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,520
multiple tax junior jobs could be

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,050
whatever first to your jobs would be for

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,490
designers junior jobs looking for

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,130
content people who you know chocolate in

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,690
your job I mean not assuming agents like

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,490
and effectively but diaper giving a

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,290
vicious record into multiple multiple

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,510
smaller issues so that is if they're

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,940
like horses like we have a Content

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:44,140
person I mean your job could be a

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,300
frontal number first one or there'll be

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,430
a bunch of persons work as well so by

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,490
preventing you junior jobless content

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:56,620
your job plus design could be a good way

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,300
you can but you gonna want to simplify

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,270
centric went on more dispersed agreement

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,140
on loading I mean I mean so this

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,210
happened with me

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,930
five is not good have it with me last

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,150
night itself basically you have the

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,940
bunch of summer that you want to get on

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,100
board open source project basically like

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,440
running the new teacher see if the feed

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,900
composition that you also go up and at

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,130
the end is ending film as if as a

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,080
developer I could figure out the

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,310
videographer what's designer it's very

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,190
difficult for me to do that

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,300
I mean editing which involves internal

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,520
probably get me worked up with stemming

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,300
so it is that what I get offloaded to

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,850
process the reducing installation steps

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,400
is one good way to go ahead do that

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,070
trust classic example which I've totally

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,580
put out every song every box or the back

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,640
is a work assignment install it's simple

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,190
there is not all involved it it is

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,140
translated into Abilene is responsible I

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,980
mean college is not possible small

00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,620
problem keeping a Gy

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,290
place to sell a project it's very

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,390
responsible another project we can walk

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,420
for I am involved in quite container

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:12,120
does it in a super super morphin be

00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,430
willing club we have like a lot of VP

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:21,000
takes dropped in 50 seconds 50 seconds

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,320
to get your next load set up and run one

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,540
of the things which is actually a pretty

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,190
debated topic and I wanted to discuss

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,680
about that in more detail is design

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,730
objectivity design objectivity is

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,790
something which service engineer I also

00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,220
of also practice at times unknowingly or

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:43,380
maybe design objectivity in other terms

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:46,740
is also called pixel touch so what does

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,600
a typical so basically I had a

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,180
conversation with a bar last night about

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,820
working on the design and some stupid

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,420
tonight pop it up more pixels like over

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,400
or midnight or you might do it more so

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,570
basically the software architecture of

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,820
the way this is all of our projects we

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,590
put them pick support so we think the

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,480
idea is to be more translating on design

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,030
is to access engineer seek an angle over

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,710
we get very big about numbers a lot of

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,720
discussions people but I'm having how

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,110
much water idiocy have what's the matter

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,180
color wire exact colors length by five

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,740
points of by - running slower by the

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,280
wagon rubbish like that these

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,140
discussions are are important in and

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,810
then rocket is launched project within

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,720
small projects they actually slow down

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,500
the flow curve if the axis along the

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,480
entire reasons type so basically 20

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,050
ravine is they don't track burning about

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,820
the time

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,920
do not let a lot of visual design

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,100
feedback so talking from releasing

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,820
features keep your feature cycle capture

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,730
it raid over time and just just just do

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,900
it or iteration just to drag an issue on

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,780
visual design exponent 30 all coming

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,330
because what happens

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,199
you have great design vision loss in a

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:05,180
minute and the innovative victims

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,370
dependent necklace not at the time

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,220
despite the design language I don't mean

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,810
CSM I mean it could be visual has been

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,580
how many I want that guy nothing beats

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,530
that but in indian alert is the beauty

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,000
of design thought about what do you

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,440
think your mother looks like whatever

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,389
design background sounds like what

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Martin is what kind of content you are

00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,500
you smoking pot versus atop enforce

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,259
course what I wanted you can attend

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,180
address is also an easy image to figure

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,419
two people to one important designer so

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:36,589
you get a sense of how easy working all

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,719
the product works but I think which is a

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,330
problem which I also say that the medium

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,490
product of the river was dealing with be

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,959
generous we have the consistent feature

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,020
requests coming in bottles on daily

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,529
basis like round probably like someone

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,260
if general patient sounds like it will

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,360
be cool to have X for the next week in

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,730
itself now what we can do in dealing

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,740
with so many features when they come you

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,640
can close the evil exhibit all of them

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,770
or just one

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,430
implement all of them everyone's keep

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,800
them whole betrayed over them a new pool

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,440
of features give a recently to live like

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,480
a thumbs up from Southern Florida where

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,279
they also have a complement with

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,510
domination nah seems the damn feature to

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,860
actually follow which features are

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,529
important and what the people actually

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,839
want this help speaker this house also

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,760
figuring out what is the version one or

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,980
what teachers get going the first

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,339
version and what we dis can cover in the

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,750
complicated version the time digging now

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,360
the same thinking and I got stopped

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,970
reading on it but sadly as it one time

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,040
over sources very very very individual

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,300
there are a few centers because most of

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,660
the benefit possible

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,130
who is that so how do you design a long

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,829
since the very beginning of the project

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,560
can actually tell in our system a lot

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,300
problems later on I mean I get like a

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,390
cut along next to us since we need we

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,690
were like 15 star and bigger

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:07,579
designer frankly because the design was

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:10,160
in charge of the prison so if nutshell

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,899
if a little recap dignity welcoming by

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,000
welcoming hanging below keeper

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:17,390
contribution Ganesha because simplify

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,839
upon boarding do not do not have to any

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,570
CLI command for a self or especially for

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,660
people for who want to design an otaku

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,730
or translator and so that these

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,940
mathematical others be mechanically what

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,450
like do not track discussions to 50 or

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,760
60 or 70 comments because good design

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,260
scapula Haas at the middle you can put

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,870
on teachers it shall have you betray

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,149
don't within factor or you cannot be

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,010
near disaster because including

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,089
designers don't make automatic weeks

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:52,560
long after problem so yes this is me

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:59,960
imagine if you could time for Q&A

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,960
[Applause]

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:13,459
I have a question about the fact

00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:20,660
thinking because I have this expression

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:26,600
before but I had not the images to us we

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:29,029
have some short distance and yeah the

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,769
best night taking so I don't mean when

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:34,610
excess of the night leaving I don't mean

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:36,920
we should have we should do the entire

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,690
process of having like locally - or the

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,399
- - Mike we're making something of the

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,510
sort you don't have to be because you

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,820
have to work the time ticking the team

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,829
in a bunch of boxes which are like an

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,570
Amish make whatever feature you trying

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:49,670
to implement slightly more visual is

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,709
actually involving less in singing the

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,260
start because this it's always easier to

00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:58,760
be easier to explain your past life

00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:01,519
image then to text it out so basically

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,920
in the work etc you won't have a week

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,199
with liner music you can actually put in

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,290
like a paper can take another project

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:13,370
that's also like put a face with of the

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,490
grandma thinking in the start a faster

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,490
bike

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,740
