Description: 
	Open source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the people building open source software are engineers with major turn on for features and more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source projects have rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with. This talk aims to deal with this problem of designing in the open which is often neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually become an arena for usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it follows an effective design process. This talk is also a practical guide for budding designers to get started with open source software.

Prior to this he has worked, both as a designer and a developer for both big companies and startups for around 2 years. He has been a contributor to open source since he started writing code and majority of my contributions are related to front-end programming and user experience decisions. He started contributing to ownCloud when they were not even on GitHub, but on Gitorious and now its one of the highest contributed PHP project on Github.
