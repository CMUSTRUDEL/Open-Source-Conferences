Title: Immutable and Stateless Systems with systemd - Lennart Poettering
Publication date: 2017-04-29
Playlist: foss-north 2017
Description: 
	In many embedded and IoT applications, but also on trusted web servers and end-user devices, read-only and cryptographically protected OS images are essential. In this talk I will discuss how systemd helps with setups like this, how to create and update immutable, stateless and volatile OS images, and how systemd will help you booting and keeping them up.

Discussed technologies will be systemd itself, Verity, the "mkosi" experimental image generator, systemd volatile boot modes, and more.
