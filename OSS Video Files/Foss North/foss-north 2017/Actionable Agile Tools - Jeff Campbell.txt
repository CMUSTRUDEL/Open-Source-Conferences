Description: 
	Do you find that all the books and talks you attend about Agile are sort of fluffy?

Do you often feel like all you need is a solid starting point?

If you want to see a few handy things that will be usable to you directly when you get back to work, then this is the talk for you.

Of course Agile is more a way of thinking than it is a particular tool or practice, but sometimes you simply have a problem you need to solve and getting a starting point will make a big difference. That is the purpose of this talk and the book it is based on: https://leanpub.com/actionableagiletools/

Most of these tools are very simple and can be implemented in less time than it takes to hear about them. Many of these tools were developed incrementally within teams I worked with, some literally taking years and exposure to a variety of organisations to reach their current state.
