so I'm Chris away I leave architecture

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,090
at SolarWinds what is SolarWinds we are

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,800
you might have heard of us before you

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,060
might be users of our products and you

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,650
might also be users without even

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,410
realising that you're at a Sullivan's

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,210
customer or user today we're well known

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,520
and the IT network management and

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,140
systems management space but I'm here to

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,120
talk about the application performance

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,770
management product suite this is an

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,590
increasingly integrated suite of

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,149
cloud-based SAS products that do

00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,789
application performance management

00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,250
management across all different angles

00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,199
so that includes Pingdom those are

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,300
synthetic checks up time checks browser

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,379
checks and user performance multi-step

00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,929
transaction monitoring

00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,839
there's log lis which is a powerful

00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:04,180
events aggregation analysis structured

00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:06,850
log platform for you know slicing and

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,010
dicing charting your logs then there's

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,560
paper trail which is an easy-to-use log

00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,800
live tail and search platform and then

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,480
app optics which is a p.m. distribute

00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,340
tracing instructor monitoring of host

00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,079
containers services and the application

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,509
code that runs on them if you follow the

00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
space that's lebra toe and trace lytic

00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,960
so it's eight languages you should be

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,890
tracing and then finally vivid cortex

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,680
which is our database performance

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,909
managing product it's the latest

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,630
addition to the family great thank you

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,119
very much

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,340
hi good morning I'm Candice with Splunk

00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,979
I'm here for DevOps day in New York

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,140
obviously so many of you may know a

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,500
little bit about Splunk we're hoping

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,079
that you to update you with the next

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,530
generation of Splunk so Splunk is way

00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,990
more than logs we do metrics we do

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,890
application performance monitoring we do

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,869
observability incident response

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,600
automated remediation and we have even

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,060
more cloud solutions we also have more

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,700
flexibility with licensing options so

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,570
please stop by our booth and turn to our

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,380
raffle and thank you for your time thank

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,020
you very much

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,420
good morning everyone my name is FDR I'm

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,370
from timescale we're a small startup

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,530
based here in New York City so time

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,530
scale is an open source time series

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,960
database that extends upon Postgres we

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,870
give you the scale and performance that

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,299
you usually associate with an OC

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,940
all database as well as a developer

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,739
experience and familiar sequel query

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,140
language that you do associate with

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,940
databases like Postgres in the developed

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,349
context what this means is that time

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,659
scale is your store for all your

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,970
observability data we're particularly

00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,409
focused on metrics so if you use

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,540
Prometheus to monitor your

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,980
infrastructure and applications and want

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,019
to learn more about how to get better

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,030
long-term storage and analytics of your

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,620
Prometheus metrics come and chat to me

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,299
and my colleagues on the third floor

00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,709
library and we'd be happy to talk to you

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,390
more about how you can use time scale

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,150
for things like that thank you all for

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,720
coming thank you very much for

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,500
supporting us time scale I'm with my new

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,930
business unit Thanh Zhu our vision is to

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,430
help organizations build run and manage

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,129
modern applications on any

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,470
infrastructure to do this we're we're

00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:22,230
rolling out three new products project

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,459
Pacific the first major change to ESXi

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,220
and in decades

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:30,680
tendu Mission Control a tool to allow

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,359
you to monitor observe and deploy

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,160
kubernetes on any environment in any

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:40,919
cloud as well as tendu kubernetes grid

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,989
open source kubernetes that run on any

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,650
infrastructure if you're interested come

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,210
