Description: 
	Low-Context DevOps: Helping DevOps find answers faster

Problem: Knowledge frustration is when siloed knowledge blocks you from doing your job. Yes, you can escalate or bother another coworker, but wouldn’t it be better if you had the instructions you needed when you needed it? Knowledge frustration is common for new people getting up to speed, experienced people moving between projects, and oncall engineers that receive an alert they’ve never seen before.

Solution: In this talk, I’ll show how to use the anthropology concept of high-context/low-context societies to eliminate knowledge frustration on DevOps/SRE teams. The result is improved productivity, continuous improvement, and a more enjoyable work environment.

Edward T. Hall was an American anthropologist who coined the phrase “high-context culture,” a culture where there are many unspoken rules. One must know a large amount of context to survive. Low-context cultures have the rules explicitly stated. This model describes engineering teams as well.

This is a talk about how to create a low-context culture where documentation is created incrementally, maintained continuously, and available just in time. Eliminate the “I’ll document it later” syndrome.

staying all the way to the last session

00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:26,770
and thank you for I don't know washing

00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,880
your hands I guess yeah so let's let's

00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,060
get to it

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,910
we're talking about low contacts DevOps

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,790
Who am I my name is Tom Lehman celli

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,070
he/him I as Jay mentioned I'm the

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,500
manager of the s3 team at sac overflow

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,300
comm I've been a system administrator

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,300
for much too long I've worked at

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,180
companies like Google and Bell Labs and

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,660
I blog and I tweet and I've written a

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,730
bunch of books and as mentioned before I

00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,860
work at Stack Overflow let me do a quick

00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,460
show of hands who here has heard of

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,850
Stack Overflow okay one two three okay

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,140
we'll just say most okay the last time I

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,270
spoke at this conference I made that

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,490
joke I have an updated version of the

00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,979
joke who here knows that sack overflow

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,910
has like a team's thing that's just for

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:19,679
like your QA within your company okay so

00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:23,679
see that's not as funny right okay yeah

00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:26,050
hmm maybe maybe maybe we'll see that

00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:27,690
again okay so this talk has three parts

00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,160
we're going to talk about high and low

00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,910
context cultures we're going to talk

00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,369
about low context DevOps coined that I

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,990
phrased and Frank's what I kind and

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:42,000
we're gonna end by talking about

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,410
leadership and I should warn you that

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,450
[Music]

00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,910
about an hour ago I took some sudafed so

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,920
I might be going really fast or if I

00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,810
took the wrong pill and everyone starts

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,250
getting wavy then the stock is gonna be

00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:01,300
much more interesting for me than for

00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:02,340
you so high and low context culture it's

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,800
story time

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:11,500
story number one someone's traveling in

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,290
the third world or inland and he comes

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,220
across a village and he goes to a

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,050
shopkeeper shopkeeper won't talk to him

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,000
goes to another store the shopkeeper

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,430
there won't talk to him it's like what's

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,290
wrong so he's walking down the street

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,159
and a little boy comes to him

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,780
and he says mister when you come to this

00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,609
village first you have to talk to the

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,040
elders and they'll bless you and then

00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,769
people will talk to you he says Wow oh

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,719
okay so go see elders Thaksin gets their

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,750
blessing and then the shopkeepers are

00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,180
willing to talk to him later that day

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,609
he's sitting by the side of the road and

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,069
he's thinking how the heck was I

00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,200
supposed to know that you know at the

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,959
same time the little boy is at home and

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,680
he's thinking how the heck could that

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:03,069
guy not know that right this is a high

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:09,760
context culture where there are many

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:11,169
unwritten rules Story number two about

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,780
seven years ago I joined Stack Overflow

00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,689
and as part of my training

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,829
I asked well how do we how do we create

00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:23,500
a virtual machine and my mentor sat me

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,230
down showed me it was about 20 steps I'm

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,639
taking notes because there's no

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,459
documentation that explains how to do

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,620
this and we we get through the whole

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,769
process and I say none of this is

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,370
written down how you know that's that's

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,840
odd

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,220
and he says well we figured that anyone

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,500
who can make it through our interview

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:50,260
process should be able to you know just

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,599
know this kind of thing and so later

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,780
that night I'm thinking how the heck was

00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,209
I supposed to know all that and he was

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,310
probably sitting at home thinking gosh

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,169
we hired this you've world recognized

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,329
system you straighter how did he not

00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:06,639
know all that but you know you could be

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,810
the best like you know VMware guru and

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,430
how are you gonna know all these things

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,349
sorry number three is much shorter the

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,159
next day I get a call from my boss now

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:20,739
at the time by the way now all of this

00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,750
is automated but at the time we had you

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,639
know this was manual and also the last

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,699
step was yet to add any new machine that

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,530
you created into a manually maintained

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,639
inventory and my boss called to say hey

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,979
you created machine didn't put in the

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,539
inventory now I could be the world's

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:39,270
most brilliant VMware expert in the

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,710
world but

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,510
how would I know that we have this

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,830
inventory right so high context cultures

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,870
high content cultures are where

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,000
communication is implicit there's less

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,830
written and formal information it's more

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,310
like hey we just know the collective

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,360
history and that's how we get through

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,230
people have to kind of read between the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,750
lines this is usually good when there

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,400
are long term relationships for example

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,200
you know if you have a party with

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,840
friends there might be certain unwritten

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,290
rules that your friends you know just

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,030
know and you've probably maybe you've

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,680
joined someone else's friends for a

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,570
night out and you don't know those rules

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,790
and it seems very descending contrasts

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,530
at to a low context culture and a low

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,440
context culture communication is

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,040
explicit there are rules you are told

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,980
what they are this kind of knowledge is

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,330
codified it's written down someplace

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:41,490
usually external usually a very

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:43,260
accessible a lot of places where your

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,500
interpersonal connections have a short

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,350
duration require a low context culture

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,410
so for example airports are usually a

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,180
low context culture you're not there

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,800
very long so you need to be told what to

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,440
do you need to be told securities this

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,080
way you know gates are that way it's not

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,670
just based on you know oh everyone knows

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,590
that the higher number gates are you

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,590
know that way right that would I

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,020
wouldn't make sense an anthropologists

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,900
study this kind of thing and they

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,030
typically classify different languages

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,370
and cultures as being high context or

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,900
low context traditionally Eastern

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,120
cultures are thought of as being more

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,330
high context it's more about what isn't

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,520
said than is what is said low context

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,720
cultures tend to include things like

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,770
Germany and Scandinavian and the u.s.

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,200
since we're in New York I thought I'd

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,910
mentioned one of my favorite high

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,550
context environments right here in New

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,850
York I live in New Jersey I commute into

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,290
New York every day and I go through Penn

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,510
Station how many people here came

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,420
through Penn Station today a lot of

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,430
people yeah super high context the map

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,210
of Penn Station only makes sense if

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:57,040
you're the person who drew this map

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,870
you know one of the often if I'm if I a

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,060
long wait for a train I just stand in

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,060
the hallway and look for tourists that

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,990
looked lost and offer to help them and

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,550
sometimes I can give them directions

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,590
sometimes I just give up and say look

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,310
I'll just walk you there I I can't even

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,280
describe it well my favorite signs in

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:19,900
Penn Station is this sign the 7th Avenue

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,760
subway is that way 30 years ago they

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,460
changed the name of the 7th Avenue

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:29,050
subway to the 1 to 3 lines but this sign

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,790
stands you know it still is up there and

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,500
I thought ok well you know it's just one

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,950
sign that they forgot to change that's

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,500
cool like you know a little mistake but

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,440
then I realized the sign is eliminated

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,210
there's a little light bulb behind that

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,050
for 30 years someone's been changing

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,260
this light bulb and is not empowered to

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:56,979
tell their boss hey maybe we should

00:07:49,260 --> 00:08:02,169
switch this sign okay so let's talk

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:05,020
about low-context DevOps I assert that a

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,390
DevOps environment where you work should

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,370
strive to be low-context and let me ask

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,900
you who would like to work in a high

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,400
let's see show of hands high and low

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,100
contact who would like to work in a high

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,660
context DevOps environment not a lot of

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,210
hands how many people would like to work

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,770
in a low context yeah ok so now I'm

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,380
gonna skip the next 20 slides where I

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,460
try to convince you and let's just go to

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:31,240
how do you make DevOps

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,010
how do you lower the context so for the

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,390
rest of this chocolates I will focus on

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,310
three ways to reduce the required

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,010
context of your DevOps environment

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:42,060
carefully constructed defaults making

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:49,030
right easy and ubiquitous documentation

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:52,690
so carefully constructed defaults one of

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,390
the clearest examples of this is new

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,570
employee onboarding how many people when

00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,880
they join their current company well I

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,410
think everyone they needed a PC or some

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,150
kind of workstation there were certain

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,710
software they needed to do their job and

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,080
they needed access to various systems in

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,760
missions on those systems right how many

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,630
people didn't have those three things

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,510
for the first month right how many for

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,600
like the first three months yeah there's

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,390
still handsome incredible think about it

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,740
we are typically at companies the

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,890
average tech workers at a company for

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,420
about three years so if for three months

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,520
you're not productive that's just

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,220
incredibly inefficient it just it just

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,680
makes me angry but why does this happen

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,270
I mean why does it stay like that well

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,820
first of all the new employees can't fix

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,470
it they're new they you know they don't

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,620
want to make trouble and they don't have

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,670
the power to make to fix the problems it

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,350
experienced employees aren't feeling the

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,240
pain anymore because they've gotten

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,680
through all that stuff so you know if

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,350
they're not feeling the pain they they

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,690
have another project they could work on

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,100
also it requires working across silos to

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,650
fix a lot of these problems you have to

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,870
work across the IT team and the InfoSec

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:10,370
team in the engineering team in an HR

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:14,410
and no one wants to talk to HR or or or

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:19,520
outside their silo it's it's difficult

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,380
and how many people here are familiar

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,090
with the Phoenix project by gene Kim

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,730
ever it's kind of the book that

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,810
crystallised or catalyze the DevOps

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,970
movement yeah and there's a copy Jing

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,590
Kim has a new book out just came out

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,380
recently called the unicorn project

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,630
which really focuses on this kind of

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,490
developer productivity highly recommend

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,200
I recommend it so much I animated his

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,900
book like that yeah

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,220
that's how strongly I feel and since he

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,740
talked a lot about it I'm not going to

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:53,140
talk much beyond what I just said let's

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:56,780
go on to number two making right easy so

00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:00,560
I have a philosophy that if you want

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:05,750
people to do something make sure that

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:11,330
the lazy path is embodies the practices

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,460
that you want them to do right so for

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,910
example if you've ever programmed with

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,610
the OpenSSL library you need a frickin

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,600
PhD to get all the settings right to

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,880
listen

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,610
four you know listen on a port as a you

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,589
know HTTP service right and once you do

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,269
get it right well next year it's all

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,940
wrong because things have changed

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:34,100
the Liebherr SSL people said you know

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,920
for our library we're going to offer an

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,190
API that just magically starts listening

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,470
on a port and if you're totally lazy and

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,069
just use all the defaults you get the

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,730
timelessly correct settings much better

00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:51,819
right the world should be this way

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,740
your CI CD pipeline should embed should

00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:56,209
embody the recommended practices if you

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,940
want everyone to do something make sure

00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,750
that's the default in all the templates

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,480
and everything in your CI CD pipeline

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,880
make sure your base library includes all

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,410
the operational goodness you know it's

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,360
it's hard enough to hire a good

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,490
developer but it's even harder to find a

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,529
good developer that also writes code

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,240
that is operable right that that

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,190
generates telemetry for the monitoring

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,680
system that has you know standard flags

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,259
all these different things that the the

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,769
operations people want developers to put

00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:30,439
into their code well some companies

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:32,029
design their base library such that you

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,500
know you can't write a hello world web

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,600
server without getting all that

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,430
operational goodness just built in for

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,199
free and that's how things should be

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:44,060
like if you want to break the standard

00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:45,829
it should be difficult and we have

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:51,199
opportunities to do this kind of thing

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:52,519
you make write make easy right on all of

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,670
our different DevOps you know

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:59,380
foundational tools you know from our bug

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:03,709
system to our source control system and

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,079
it's really difficult to develop empathy

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,550
for new people I mean often the only way

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,860
you can improve some of these things is

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,209
find a developer maybe a junior

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,120
developer or someone who's been recently

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:16,819
hired and just sit with them for a week

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,360
and observe and see what problems they

00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:23,720
have or maybe a day or if you don't have

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,939
a day for an hour you will learn so much

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,639
and you will you will actually you'll be

00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:31,339
highly embarrassed as you start making

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,560
all these changes that of course why why

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:38,660
wouldn't that be the default

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:41,430
and lastly ubiquitous documentation

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,010
ideally we would like documentation to

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,100
be the right information in the right

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,990
place at the right time right if I'm in

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,270
a situation I shouldn't have to think oh

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,330
let me go search for that it should be

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,790
right in front of my face which reminds

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,180
me of a recent trip to London I landed

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,580
in London Heathrow Airport and then took

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,520
the train to Paddington Station a

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,590
beautiful train station and the next

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,540
thing that I needed was to take a taxi

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:12,090
to my hotel and I was about to ask

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,190
someone where's the taxi stand and I

00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,350
looked down at my feet and I saw that

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,430
there are these lines here let me turn

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,310
the picture so you could read that

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,810
better look it says taxi and I just

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,220
looked down and I just started following

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,380
the line and there are other people

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,540
doing it - were just like zombies like

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,190
and this was perfect and it was it was

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,780
the right amount of information just

00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,900
where taxis it didn't have to explain

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,630
what a taxi is or you know quote from

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,320
Wikipedia just taxis this way and it was

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,330
where I wanted awesome example wouldn't

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,430
it be great if like your DevOps

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:48,120
environment all the tools and everything

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:50,250
we're like that it it should be and we

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,060
can do it now it's the miracle of URLs

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,560
right I've been assisting long enough

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,920
that you're ELLs didn't exist when I

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,030
first got access to a UNIX system and

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,800
you had to like write a paragraph

00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,480
explaining you know go to the bookshelf

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,120
it's the third book on the right turn to

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,810
page 75 third paragraph down now you

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,460
have a URL we're so lucky and we should

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,230
include these URLs you know just

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,360
everywhere obvious you know in error

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,850
messages in our control panels in our

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,370
alert messages everywhere that people

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,040
might want to find info in fact when

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,860
someone asks me a question I often say I

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,170
I will gladly ask the question to you

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,500
but first tell me where did you look so

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:34,550
far and usually I'll discover at least

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,440
one place that I need to put a URL or

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:42,290
they searched for a word that's slightly

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:46,020
different like in our company system we

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,830
what was it oh it was I edited a page so

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,690
that it said

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,270
401k like five times your with

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,950
parentheses hyphenated spaces so that no

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,580
matter what you search for you you would

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,950
find the darn page on our 401k plan

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,770
Apple gets it if you've upgraded a Mac

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,750
recently and the there changing the

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,490
default shell to Z shell if you're still

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,830
using bash when you open a terminal

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,070
window it tells you here's the command

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,940
you need to type to change the default

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:17,340
and here's a URL explaining why

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:23,820
well not why but it gives you more

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:27,090
information anyway so creating a culture

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,340
of documentation takes effort up and

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,770
down the org chart management needs to

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:35,760
set expectations it's not done until

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:38,910
it's documented that has to be a phrase

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,680
your managers use all the time I also

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,270
say it's not done until it's monitored

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,640
and a bunch of other things but start

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,160
with documentation and not just for big

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,200
projects you know every time you close a

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,560
ticket was there something I could have

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,300
changed or updated that would make in

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,220
the documentation so that the next

00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,250
person that gets a similar ticket has an

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,040
easier job right and now you're creating

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,290
this virtuous cycle of improved

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,250
efficiency because the documentation

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,690
just keeps getting better and better

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,360
similar you know when you answer a

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,209
question in chat or when you're doing

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,630
releases I maintain an open source

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:21,510
project called DNS control and we needed

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,720
to do a ship a new release recently and

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,860
I told a co-worker well here's the

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,620
document on how to do it and and I'll

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,210
I'll meet with you in half an hour I got

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,790
there a half an hour later she was done

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,630
because and I was very very proud of

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:42,750
myself because like it spells out the

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,640
the all the details because every time

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,170
I've done a release I found at least one

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,650
thing to change and then I asked her I

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,090
said okay now that you've done a release

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,370
complain about the document and she said

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,570
well you know I had to try this twice

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,240
before I figured out what you really

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,980
meant awesome like to me that's victory

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,480
that's like yes we we have an

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,940
opportunity to make an improvement

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,370
I think people should always be

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,590
documenting I have a column in ACM Q

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,299
magazine here if you google limoncello

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,110
always be documenting you'll find this

00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,850
article about the a lot of my philosophy

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,100
about the the virtuous cycle of

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,890
documentation leading to efficiency

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,600
leading to small bits of automation that

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:26,730
rolls up to bigger bits of automation

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,490
and anyway take a look we should treat

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,900
documents like we treat software you

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,640
should be able to file bugs there should

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,679
be you know product management should

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,580
take the documentation as seriously as

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,679
the software and we have to fight some

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,790
of the excuses we hear from people that

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,630
don't want to write documentation

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:49,380
someone recently said well my code is my

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:52,049
documentation no it's not at a minimum

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,510
you need to write a doc that points to

00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:57,390
where in the code you would look right

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,830
if people need more inspiration if I'm

00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:03,720
sure I've convinced all of you but if

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:05,760
your co-workers need inspiration on why

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,380
to document someone recently out of

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,390
meetup they said so the probably

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,610
documentation is it helps everyone on my

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,429
team except me I already know the

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,410
information I said no no it helps you

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:19,620
because people will bother you less and

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,330
most importantly the more you document

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,210
the more you can relax when you're on

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:27,210
vacation and to me that's that's reason

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,210
enough but in a lot of organizations

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,309
there just aren't any Doc's right how

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,360
many people have no kind of document

00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:42,780
repository oh only a few hands excellent

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:45,299
I'm proud of you all raise your hand if

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,820
you like to write documentation not a

00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,630
lot I've written like five or six books

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,650
and I don't like writing documentation

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm not calling you liars

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm just saying it's not a common trait

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:05,750
and I have some theories on why people

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:08,549
avoid writing documentation one is that

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,130
you know you finally sit down and you're

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,650
like what what's the scope of this stock

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,750
like do I have to like

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,750
right a whole bunch of background or

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,910
just you know just the specific answer a

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,130
lot of times we're uncertain what the

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,170
audience is like am i writing this does

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,740
it have to be clear enough for someone

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,450
who's like senior to understand or does

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:36,570
this is this for someone who just got

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:39,050
hired or you know very junior oh and

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,120
then there's this other reason and I

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,220
have to warn you that this this next

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,700
reason I'm gonna show you a slide that

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,800
is very scary therefore I'm gonna start

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,250
with a disclaimer I mean do it in

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,100
carnival barker style ladies and

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,280
gentlemen boys girls and gender rebels

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,650
DevOps of all ages what I'm about to

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,160
show you is the most terrifying slide

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,590
ever seen at a DevOps conference Stephen

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,050
King's books and movies have nothing on

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,990
what you're about to see people with

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,650
weak constitutions may choose lose leave

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,410
the room

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,640
parents cover your children's eyes if

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,750
you're pregnant or under the supervision

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:25,230
of a doctor I cannot be held responsible

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:28,860
for what happens are you ready are you

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:34,230
ready okay one two three

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:38,340
it's a blank screen oh my god I hope the

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:40,980
microphone picked that up yeah blank

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,620
blank screen syndrome it's that's the

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,440
writer's biggest fear and and for just

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,590
for those of you like so if you're a BIM

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,830
user that's what that looks like the

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:56,010
Microsoft people in the room prettier

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,590
more junior people wha what notepad

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,840
looks like the sophisticated people I

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,030
don't want to leave you out

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,390
and of course you know the big trend

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,390
thing

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:13,129
can't leave that out so while not a

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,620
recognized medical condition blank

00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,720
screen syndrome is a very real problem

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,759
right you've spent all this night like

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,320
all week you thought oh you know Friday

00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,299
I'm finally gonna have time to work on

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,830
that document and all through the week

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,970
you you're just you're really

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,700
procrastinating but really you're

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,529
thinking Friday I'm gonna finally sit

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,360
down and write that document and and you

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:35,419
Friday finally comes and you sit down

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,139
and you get that blank screen all right

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:40,759
what do I do now what's the what's the

00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:43,909
scope what's the audience what's the

00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,789
everything and and then over in the side

00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,710
of your screen a chat message appears

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,409
and you say oh I'll come back to the

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,470
document later and you never come back

00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:56,840
to that document now now you you never

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,450
don't you never do so so we really need

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,100
to let's get rid of the blank page

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,750
syndrome once and for all there's

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,399
there's a couple basic things we can do

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,820
first of all we can make really awesome

00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:09,860
templates right in our environment at

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,929
stack every service has a what we call

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:18,080
the service stock every alert has an

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:19,370
alert template and so when you're

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,019
starting you you don't start with a

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,399
blank document you bring in this

00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:25,490
template and it's more like you're

00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:27,950
filling out a form you know what's what

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,779
does this do and usually what's not on

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,820
this slide is that there's little helper

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,919
text in italics you know delete this

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,860
sentence but you know this is where you

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,299
write you know a one sentence summary of

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,250
the service what's the history what's

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:45,500
the desired state what are some common

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:48,019
issues similarly for alerts another

00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,029
thing you can do is try don't try to

00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:53,269
write a big document write in small

00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,710
batches like I mentioned before yeah

00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:58,039
like everything comes in small batches

00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,990
nowadays have you noticed this like dog

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:02,509
food comes in small batches I don't know

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,090
why my dog would care about that anyway

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,279
right in small batches like you close

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,440
that ticket maybe you're only changing

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:13,070
one sentence to the document and that's

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,049
fine you're just a lot I would rather

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,490
have a million small changes in a week

00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:18,740
than a

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:23,030
an attempt to do a big change on Friday

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,910
that you end up not doing also include

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,830
your documentation in your work

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,930
estimates when your boss says how long

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,960
is that going to take and you say three

00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,360
days or four if I also update the

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,510
documentation don't say that just say

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,000
four days just build it in right I had

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,110
someone recently say Tom as manager you

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,730
don't give us enough time to write

00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,770
documentation I said have I ever told

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,470
you don't write documentation you give

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:52,430
me the time estimates it includes the

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:55,160
documentation in the updates the other

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,500
thing we can do is we can take text that

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,790
people already write we could find where

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,010
do you engineer is already right and

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,680
repurpose that text so every time you

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,150
get email with a really good explanation

00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,630
hit reply all and send them a compliment

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,600
say hey that's a great explanation why

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,650
don't you put that in our document repo

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,260
right when someone has a great

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,680
explanation in chat room tell them hey

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,630
put that in the doc repo years ago I

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,880
worked at Google and I remember it was

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,620
two weeks in when my co-workers sent

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,690
email to the whole team saying new

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,050
policy when when this happens on our

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,210
server you have to do this and I talked

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:35,840
to the person and said okay that's great

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:39,560
does this why don't you put this in our

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,130
dock area and he said well no the whole

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,990
team got the email and I said oh so does

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:51,470
this policy not apply to anyone hired

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:55,130
after today yeah so I mentioned I work

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:57,650
at Stack Overflow another place that

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,840
people that engineers like to write

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,860
without prompting its Stack Overflow

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,720
right and it's it's so easy because

00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,840
someone else wrote the question so that

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,820
helps define the spoke the the scope and

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,060
the audience right if someone asks how

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,350
do I exit the vim editor you know when

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,940
you're done you're done when you've

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,740
answered the question you know the

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,130
audience you can kind of guess that this

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,230
person's new to vim though my favorite

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,210
ving joke is I've been using vim for ten

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,540
years because I can't figure out how to

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,540
quit

00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,519
and there's even templates and wizards

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,559
there's the when you go to ask a

00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,090
question there's now the question asking

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,909
wizard and soon there's going to be a

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:45,710
question answering wizard and I'm not

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:49,190
here to you know do a sales pitch or

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:52,460
anything but we do have this new stack

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:56,769
overflow for teams it's it's pretty cool

00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:02,360
we have small medium and large systems

00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:06,049
okay whoo last part let's talk about

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,230
leadership there boy we've talked about

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:10,460
a lot of things today haven't we like

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:14,419
documentation culture and smart defaults

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:17,840
and all these different things but who's

00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:19,190
gonna make that happen are you gonna

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,259
wait for your manager to make that

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,480
happen your managers probably not here

00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:24,860
plus your manager has other things to do

00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,539
your manager if they're good managers

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,480
probably is delegating this back down to

00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:31,730
you in other words we need to be the

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,769
heroes that we're waiting for don't wait

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,940
for other people to start on these kind

00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:38,269
of things and this is my call to action

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,679
and this is why I'm happy to be the last

00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:43,070
speaker because this is the note I want

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,539
to end on everything DevOps related is

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,779
about making changes in your

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:49,369
organization and who's gonna make that

00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,470
change who's gonna make that change for

00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:54,529
the better

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:59,749
it's it has to be you we are the heroes

00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:02,059
that we're waiting to arrive now people

00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:04,029
often say Tom but I don't want to be a

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:06,590
manager managers make those change

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:08,049
managers management and leadership are

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,919
two very different things

00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:14,899
management is something in the org chart

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,669
management is really about three things

00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,799
about setting priorities providing

00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:21,610
resources to meet those priorities and

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,200
clearing roadblocks if you're a manager

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,549
and you're doing one of those three

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,369
things by yourself on the back you're

00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:29,869
doing what managers are supposed to do

00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:33,200
leadership is different leadership is

00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:35,590
something every everyone can do leaders

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,269
everyone should be a leader a leader is

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,000
in my mind best symbolized by the

00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:41,620
children's game follow the leader which

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,790
has to come

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:49,210
opponents the Li child does two things

00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,550
that symbolize leadership to me they go

00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,260
first and they make it easy for others

00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,730
to follow

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,710
they go first that's kind of obvious

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,750
they're at the head of the line but they

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,250
make it easy for others to follow

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,890
there's decisions that have to be made

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:06,220
do we jump over this rock or do we walk

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,140
on top of it they make that decision and

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,600
everyone else copies them and that makes

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,400
it easy to follow when we walk under a

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,200
branch do we duck under the branch or do

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,730
we lift it up and hand it to the next

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,929
person well I'm going to decide we're

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,520
gonna lift it up and hand it to the next

00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:21,970
person they're gonna hand it to the next

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,160
and next and next they went first and

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:29,559
they made it easy for others to follow

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:33,160
and that's the essence of leadership in

00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:37,230
summary we talked about high context and

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:41,559
low context and low context DevOps I

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:45,150
won't read all this slide but this is

00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:48,010
where everyone takes a picture anyway

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,450
that's really my talk thank you all I

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,450
hope you enjoyed the conference and I

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,400
hope to see you next year

00:29:50,450 --> 00:30:00,829
