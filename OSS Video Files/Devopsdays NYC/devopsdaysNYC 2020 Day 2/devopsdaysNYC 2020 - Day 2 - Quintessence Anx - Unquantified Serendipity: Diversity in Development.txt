Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 2 - Quintessence Anx - Unquantified Serendipity: Diversity in Development
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: devopsdaysNYC 2020 Day 2
Description: 
	Learning how to write software, architect infrastructure, and automate deployments is cognitively taxing. So much so, we probably spend a great deal of energy learning how to learn, learning how to retain, learning how to apply, learning how to be efficient, that learning how to be with each other gets lost in the mess.

Straight to the point: Computer programmer. Software developer. Production Engineer. When you read these terms, a picture probably starts to form in your mind’s eye - a sort of default for what a person behind these titles looks like. Maybe also how they sound - what language do you expect them to speak? How do they speak it?

Most likely, when you read those titles, you visualize a white male. He speaks English fluently with a local accent. If you pull up the photo behind an anonymized résumé, you might be surprised to find a Muslim woman wearing a hijab. Or perhaps you see someone who doesn’t speak fluent English, speaking instead with their native Mexican accent.

A lot of the imagery that’s been produced for software developers intentionally or inadvertently reinforces this vibe - the notion that the default developer is a white male, even when history and globalization show that that’s probably not the case. Yet because this is the view when women and other minorities join our ranks, they are given advice that encourages them to behave socially and linguistically like white men.

In this talk, I’ll explore how we can solve problems together as a diverse group, quite literally just by sharing space. I’ll discuss ways that we can be better allies to each other by fostering understanding, and highlight the positive impact of normalizing the appearance of minorities in the field.

	00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,460
hello everyone as you said my name is

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,410
quintessence and I'm here to talk to you

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,869
about diversity and development or as I

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,090
like to call it unquantified serendipity

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,610
because as we invite more people into

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,950
our spaces we can serendipitously solve

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,380
more problems in our space and in our

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,820
teams and our organizations before I get

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,350
started I'd like to point out this is a

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,850
very choose your own adventure style

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,500
talk I'm gonna be hitting a lot of

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,989
points very quickly for things that you

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,059
can implement don't try and take them

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,179
off just pick one or two and with that

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:50,809
said why do we hire people right we post

00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:53,030
a job rack online and we maybe want AWS

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,039
or Python but we also want leadership

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,980
and communication and if we're not

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,260
cautious our perceptions and biases will

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,329
influence how we see leadership and

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,699
communication others so called softer

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,979
skills and if we're not aware of these

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,680
perception biases we're not going to

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,150
effectively counteract them and it's

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
important for us to do this right

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,880
because again if we're going to have

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,100
spaces that are going to have a lot of

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,170
ideas flowing through the room we want

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,600
to be able to make that space safe and

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,189
we want to protect that space and I

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,560
actually have an article linked at the

00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,479
end that talks about someone who writes

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,100
about a Polish diacritic ass they didn't

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,200
hire him for being polish but there was

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,840
a bug in their system that specifically

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,810
affected this character and I'll again

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,579
hit this at the end but moving on when

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,140
you're talking about safe spaces it's

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,899
hard to put yourself in someone else's

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,820
place a space let us say for white

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:45,799
people generally might not be safe for

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,079
women might not be safe for lesbians and

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,359
that's just me standing in front of you

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,070
that's just my 3 right so when you're

00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,500
approaching it your mindset very much

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,380
matters I and other persons are not

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,060
people to be fixed it's a situation or a

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,799
structure that we're fixing so that

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,810
people can be welcomed into these spaces

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,119
and so now I'm going to address some

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,280
subtle mindset shifts that we can all do

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,009
that will make the spaces more welcoming

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,880
and more robust the first thing I really

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,560
want to point out as I watch is we

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,840
really want to make sure that we're

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,000
coaching people right we don't want to

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,350
rescue people and rescuing in a

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,930
professional environment can look very

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,300
much like oh hey let me do that for you

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,590
it's very innocuous but you don't want

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,990
to be rescuing people out of their own

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,490
duty

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,710
their own research you want to empower

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,240
them and as you empower them you're also

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,010
going to empower them when they're

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,530
looking to professionally Network this

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,360
kind of looks like hey I got done that

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,850
job you don't want that you want them to

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,070
say they got themselves that job because

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,720
you gave them the hand up you introduce

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,850
them to your professional networks or

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,010
other resources that you had available

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,780
to you as a more senior person once

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,340
people are in your organization you're

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,770
going to need to support diverse

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,020
learning styles read the docs is not

00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,970
good blanket advice people speak English

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,270
as a second language some people like to

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,220
talk right you need to support everybody

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,260
and when you're supporting them

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,180
reciprocal mentorship is something you

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,340
can do which is basically the idea that

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,800
you're a newbie or mentee needs to know

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,530
one thing or one set of things but they

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,360
bring other things select them but while

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,010
you're focusing and training that one

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,390
set of things you need to won't be the

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,640
one that provides their challenges

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,320
telling them to pick a problem solve it

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,600
will be limited by whatever they

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,200
currently know and that doesn't coach

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,940
them for the future right as you're

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,530
setting up these different situations

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,900
you also want to make sure that your

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,940
organs are resilient for their growth so

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,590
if you find out oh there are a lot of

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,040
women in leadership positions

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,540
that's unfortunate that's acceptance and

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,220
we don't want that right we want a

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,690
resilient organ we want to proactively

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,700
change what that looks like

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,350
and we also want to make sure that

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,570
people know that they don't have to fake

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,400
it till they make it right confidence is

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,500
supported by knowledge and experience

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,460
if someone's lacking in confidence try

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,470
supporting their knowledge and

00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,250
experience and see if that confidence

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,320
doesn't just follow out also explicit

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,910
onboarding this is Doc's and videos and

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,500
things if you don't have explicit

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,900
onboarding you're going to have social

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,000
onboarding that's great that relies on

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,020
the social structure to work we've

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,290
solved that problem why am i up here

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,510
right

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,280
also when you're coaching your juniors

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,690
and mentees make sure that they know

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,700
what title pays them the most for the

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,680
work it doesn't matter if the title

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,050
should or should not exist that pops

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,730
engineer okay mm-hmm

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,070
make sure they know what it is and they

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,780
get paid for their knowledge as a more

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,490
senior person you also know the who's

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,440
who either within your company or within

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,160
your broader community so make sure the

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,590
juniors and men

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,330
tee's also know the who's who I call

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,190
this the hiring nucleus you can call it

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,510
whatever helps you just make sure that

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,690
you're doing those introductions for

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,450
them lastly but not leastly lien ops

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,160
coffee ups these are great these allow

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,330
for an intersection of skills and

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,220
seniority z' that when otherwise

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,530
organically happen and I definitely

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,690
recommend implementing as many of these

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,640
as you can right either and within your

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,750
companies or in your communities if you

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,670
have any questions my name is
