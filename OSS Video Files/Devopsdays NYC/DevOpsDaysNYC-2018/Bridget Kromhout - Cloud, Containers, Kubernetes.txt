Publication date: 2018-02-01
Playlist: DevOpsDaysNYC-2018
Description: 
	Microsoft issued me a Mac when they hired me to help people use Linux on Azure. If this sounds like the beginning of a nerdy joke, it’s because we need to question long-held opinions, let go of deeply-cherished stereotypes, and welcome this new era of open collaboration.

Let’s take the 10,000 foot tour of today’s cloud, containers, and orchestration landscape before diving into specifics we can use when making calls on microservices, backing data stores, and app decomposition. We’ll talk public cloud, containers, and k8s from the “Open at Microsoft” perspective!
