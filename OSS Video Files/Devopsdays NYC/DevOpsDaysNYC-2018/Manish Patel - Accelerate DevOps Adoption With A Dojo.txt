Title: Manish Patel - Accelerate DevOps Adoption With A Dojo
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: DevOpsDaysNYC-2018
Description: 
	The word dojo means “the place of the way.” Originally, dojos were learning halls attached to temples. At Verizon, we’ve created engineering dojos to accelerate our learnings around real challenges in our organization. Through a combination of coaching, doing, and evaluating, dojo participants transform knowledge into wisdom.

One of the main things we do as coaches is to establish shared understanding of the desired outcome by using a technique called story mapping. We’ll show teams how having a visual map helps in all aspects of the delivery lifecycle including development, testing, and operations. Next, we’ll focus on testability first and dive into what kinds of tests we need to create to maximize our coverage around the desired outcome. Finally, we’ll dive right into the code with developers and help teams on things like code redesign, CI pipelines, branching, and AWS.

The structure of a Dojo engagement is usually 6 weeks with 2 and ½ day Sprints. We keep our sprints short on purpose, mainly for coaches and participants to focus coaching needs, and to surface any issues quickly. The short sprints also help in evaluating whether a given technical approach is working and whether we need to pull in other coaches for advice.

The lessons we learned at Verizon are relevant to anyone attempting to undergo a transformation as they reflect our attempts to address the cultural and communications ingredients that are vital in DevOps. In this talk, I’ll share what we learned about starting and running a learning Dojo, why we feel the Dojo model works, and how we are addressing some common DevOps challenges going forward.

[Music]

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:29,340
we're calling our immersive learning

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,439
program at Verizon I just thought I'd

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,050
share that photograph with you that's I

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,739
took that 20 years ago standing in Times

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,860
Square

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,670
and kind of cool how technologies change

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,100
I had to use a real camera with black

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,620
and white film go into a dark room and

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,450
develop it so I was going through my

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,430
stuff figure out let's share that with

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,710
you little bit about me most of my

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,079
experience has been with very large

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,309
companies so I'm not kind of the startup

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:06,180
guy the IT organizations that I work in

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:10,610
usually number in you know like thousand

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,900
to like tens of thousands of developers

00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,880
best way to get ahold of me is just

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,060
email me I'm not out my channel value

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,570
they're great out in the mail I find I

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:27,210
have one channel it's better to manage

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,759
agenda for today I'll talk about why the

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,549
dojos are learning a good learning model

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,380
for company like writing you should went

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,960
from three philosophies if the dojo is

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,369
kind of the credo that all the coaches

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,409
lived by closing the dojo the structure

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:51,270
of a dojo so I'll take you kind of like

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,799
what a typical team goes through all the

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,710
stuff that we've learned and then

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,729
hopefully if my video works I will share

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,539
an internal marketing video

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:03,430
we had created for you guys actually for

00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:09,340
for internally for the dough goes to

00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:11,379
market but it's a cool video so so the

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,080
challenge at Verizon where work is huge

00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:17,650
we're talking about scape upscaling

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,440
and upskilling 16,000 engineers and

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,900
DevOps right so far we're learning it's

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,239
not like we can just send people like 20

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,810
at a time to a program to learn about

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:32,530
right the model that we came up with is

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:38,170
it's something that is suited to learn

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:40,540
DevOps at scale I just have to mention

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:49,090
that we do have a booth outside so

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:51,610
please you know do come and visit us so

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,599
I'll take you to a tour this is the dojo

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:58,000
that I worked it's gotta be New Jersey

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,799
we've got three u.s. dojos and we've got

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,510
two international dildos

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:06,100
a lot of them have kind of the same

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,769
format it's very cool space where I took

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,069
this photograph move from is something

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:14,200
we call our demo lounge a giant screen

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,260
comes down and we do fun things like

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,350
look at Jenkins bills and test-driven

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,870
development so really exciting stuff

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:30,010
that no one cares about except the

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:33,540
people in to do this is like when the

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,540
first Jenkins bill goes live

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,699
[Applause]

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,650
we actually are very fortunate to have a

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:59,770
we will do these calls stretch breaks

00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:04,190
this is one so in addition to the DevOps

00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:08,210
we have found that when we combine other

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,660
principles and product thinking designed

00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,990
to thinking together and get an

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,570
acceleration effect in the team right so

00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:21,890
kind of like what the the some of the

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:25,250
speakers have 74 is for engineers to

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,130
orient towards understanding more about

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,650
the customer more about what the

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,170
products that they're building so we

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:41,120
combine all these group practices of a

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:43,930
unique format dojo really Japanese

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,600
wearing a meeting place of the way

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,420
originally Dodos were attached to

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:54,440
learning Hall concept of an engineering

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:58,160
dojo comes from Target where her boss

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,560
was when Ross came over brought we

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,770
basically brought over one of the

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,500
reasons is to start this engineering Go

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,750
Go that Verizon we're fortunate enough

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,300
to have some of the coaches also that

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,760
were working in the target dojo or now

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,760
authorized and coaching folks like me

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,930
all right so the three philosophies we

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:27,169
have the first philosophy is the stink

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,750
old stinky learning now I really wish

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,700
like when vo got plugged into the matrix

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,620
that's how I can teach people DevOps

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,190
right like I can just blow the program

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,140
you like learn CI

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,110
but it doesn't work that way and

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,640
especially when you're talking about

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,890
16,000 engineers and especially when

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,190
you're talking about teams that are at

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,250
all different kinds of you know

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,520
different places in their journey to

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,440
what they're doing so some of the basic

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
stuff yes you know knowledge you read

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,080
blog and gain some knowledge you go to

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,500
conferences gain knowledge but the thing

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,400
that we focus a lot on in the dojo is

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:14,540
context and strengths and so we ask

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,480
teams bring your work in right that's

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,790
content bringing your work bringing your

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,530
backlog bring in your challenges because

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,950
each team is different and we want to

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,620
meet you where your app constraints we

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,660
have home since Verizon since dojos are

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,790
part of Verizon we have all of the same

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,340
constraints that any team does have the

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,590
same network we have the same security

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,410
policies if we have all of them all of

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,690
the same things that a team goes through

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,520
we also have that and so when we've

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,670
learned within their context and

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,770
constrains they learn faster right stuff

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,060
works because we're doing it inside and

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,420
then the disk concept of perspective

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,880
where you know we bring in a developer

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,980
and QA and an Operations person and a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,480
product owner and when they're sitting

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,660
right next to each other that you'll

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,700
understand better what what that person

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,940
goes through right typically the places

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:14,300
like Verizon teams are really far apart

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,940
in some cases across geographic

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,650
boundaries so we change that and we make

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:23,450
the team see things from a different

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:25,780
perspective the second philosophy is

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,550
this thing we call shared understanding

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,620
and it comes from a guy named David

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,380
Kelly maybe you've heard of this firm

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,250
idea they work with Apple a lot they

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,310
design the first Mouse and it's just

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,710
belief that a good product and good

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,979
outcome doesn't have

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,050
in isolation right it's not it's not

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:51,350
like somebody has an idea that you would

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,310
ship it over Nike to do that you need to

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,740
do things together

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,490
you need to talk things together so we

00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,229
call that shared understanding and the

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,130
third thing is this thing called doing

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:07,820
solving so if you've seen it it's a nice

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:12,800
little equation to kind of sum up the

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:17,870
value that you deliver is a fraction of

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,229
your why you're doing things versus how

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:24,169
you're doing right so if you as an IT

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:27,590
organization focus more on how you're

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:29,840
doing things your value goes down right

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:34,070
do you focus on why you're doing things

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,940
the customers value this formula comes

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,830
from a guy named David husband he runs a

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,330
company called Def Jam the reason is

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:47,600
called dude bars and kind of looks like

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:49,279
the big about so those are the three

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,800
philosophy that I'll take you through

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,640
kind of what a typical dojo structure

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,400
would look like before we bring a team

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,500
into the dojo we will have a four-hour

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,810
session with them we will ask them

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,560
questions like why are you doing what

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,290
you do

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,760
what's the value to the customer we'll

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,360
ask him what are their learning goals

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,240
right you want to learn in this case

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,570
this team this is one of our network

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,190
teams that actually the IT support

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,709
system that made the fiber for things

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:29,970
like the injured

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:33,360
so this team came in and they were

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,510
having a particular problem with the

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,630
time it took to install certain

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,070
networking equipment 60 days and this

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,800
team came in they said we want to work

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,760
on a project that would I reduce it down

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:52,290
to seven to 14 days and so that's our

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,779
conference they also wanted to learn

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,139
some micro services and deploy on Cloud

00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,820
Foundry right so we created a unique

00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,149
experience for them because of their

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,430
requirements be chartering last four

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:09,060
hours some of the key things in

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:11,040
chartering are we really get down to the

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,720
learning goals and we get down to the

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,070
business goals and we also get down to

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,649
some of the things that the team doesn't

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,160
play that the team members want to teach

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:22,160
each other

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:29,519
what's chartering is done and it's a

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,680
paper exercise put the documents where

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,940
they're going to sit into those the idea

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,430
being that when they see that every day

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,279
they're more likely to keep their focus

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,470
to understand some of the goals it's

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,750
also a good tool for the coaches

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,839
typically we have more than one coaches

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,910
in the dojo so for coats to quickly kind

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,279
of see what a team is working on we keep

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,279
a lot of these giant sheets of paper

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:02,459
each each effort in the dojo is called

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,709
the challenge right it's not like I

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:07,050
think Ana counterculture - this word

00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:10,800
project which has a really bad meaning

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:14,220
at 19 so we called it a challenge it

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,949
last six weeks so the team is actually

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,370
with us in in desert of doing this for

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,370
six weeks

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:28,750
it begins and in this case this team the

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,460
same network team they brought in they

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,850
brought in their business partners from

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,710
the tri-state region so we had a network

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,430
engineers that actually planned the

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,470
network we had network planners and then

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,930
we actually had the field operations the

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,540
people that go out and install the

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,340
network paper so we had we had this

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,130
bridge big group in the delegator like

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,900
40 people and typically what that

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:57,820
happens and we also had ID there and we

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,480
flew up some of their their follow your

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,810
orders people involved in Virginia and

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,120
typically what a fraud when when the

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,700
team comes in and they're working on

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,640
something new I'll use a technique

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,930
called story mapping and that's that's

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,850
me in the back there using this

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,650
technique and you can find out more

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,140
about this technique it's from a guy

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,690
named Jeff Patton written a book called

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,010
user story nothing we definitely

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,580
encourage you that if you want to learn

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,650
more to explore that I think I think

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,870
it's a valuable technique for for all

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,470
you know people involved in DevOps

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,060
should be using so we do this exercise

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,280
called story mapping the important did

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,089
the idea is that there's a lot of

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,550
different top going on and we need to

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:50,460
capture that and we need to make a basic

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:54,100
flow out of the system that also that

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:57,940
also makes that also have has the effect

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,980
of creating a shared understanding with

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:06,070
all the people involved this is what

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:07,570
we're going to build once once we

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,510
finished with the story mapping we go

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,940
right into our version of a go each

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:18,090
sprint in the dojo last to have

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:22,000
typically that scared because of the

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:25,750
short duration but we don't do that to

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,990
pressure team we do that and a coaching

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,730
tool as well as a couple other reasons

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,770
but since we only have the team for six

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,180
weeks we want to make sure that if

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,790
there's something going wrong with the

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,010
course correct the case of this team we

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,370
found out that there was some downstream

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:45,040
dependencies we needed some people from

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:50,710
another application and so we actually

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:53,260
flew that person in from Texas role we

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:56,680
also used two and a half to kind of take

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,950
out all the stuff around agile like

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,730
planning poker and estimating and all

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,090
that stuff

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:11,800
so we just break work down into

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:14,110
manageable chunks this is what our agile

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,670
looks like it's very simple we actually

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,000
you only use a board and don't use

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:22,510
deidre in fact you find that when we use

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,010
school it has the opposite effect of

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,710
isolating people because they're only

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,820
focused on what they're looking at in

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:32,710
terms of their tasks

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,260
so this is we use a big board because we

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:41,890
want the entire team to visualize their

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:45,250
work and as in terms of accelerating

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,200
DevOps when we break down the work we

00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,630
will actually start the conversation of

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,490
testing first right you have this piece

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,010
that you're working on you have this

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,840
micro service that you're writing how

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,000
are you going to test right and that

00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,120
starts all kind of the conversation with

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,460
the database guy on the Ox guy the

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,370
testers right we get all of that ironed

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:11,610
out front in fact it's some of the first

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,610
spring are purely spent on testing

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:22,930
we had this we also encourage that have

00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:25,660
typically never done a certain kind of

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,779
role to take on that boat in this case

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,059
of the tester on the network team she

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,879
was very good at actually writing code

00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:37,569
and so I asked her well why don't you

00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:40,120
just write one of the services testing

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:43,209
yourself so she actually did that and

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,410
here was her result we had 27 tests

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:49,740
written in a matter of days we do both

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,740
things

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,139
so don't take my word for it this is one

00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:59,230
of our retros you can see like a lot of

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:04,600
the positive stuff including that the

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:06,720
coffee is really good and you got the

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,699
sprit board and five story about being

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,480
communication and probation sharing all

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:16,990
good stuff we usually see a lot of teams

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:20,949
sake a lot of that all the time for the

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:24,160
stuff that doesn't go so well the

00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:26,920
coaches will surface this up as a team

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,339
to leadership right so in this case this

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,170
team that said you have a lot of

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,029
interdependencies with other team that's

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,449
something that dojo will bring to

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:39,550
leadership they listen here's what

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,829
here's the gears of polymer hat and this

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,829
has an acceleration effect on demo right

00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:46,269
because now the leaders no no this is

00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:54,579
something I hadn't didn't realize that

00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:56,620
was happening we give team names but

00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:00,370
this is a really cool thing I wanted to

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:05,189
share with you that the network team but

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,189
this team was vibrating there

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:13,920
and so one of the guys came over just by

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:21,450
Metallica at the end of every donor we

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:23,370
usually celebrate with the team okay so

00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:29,780
when I talk about kind of the results

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:29,780
we've been doing this for a year and

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,280
we've had some really great success

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,290
we've had teams take the red pill go

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,210
really far down the rabbit hole we had

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:44,640
directors that have changed their entire

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:49,200
organizations to be more like dota team

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,430
where there are full stack teams we've

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:57,870
had other teams that have not been as

00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:00,450
receptive and so one of the things we're

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,220
working on this year you know typical

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,440
DevOps fashions we failed it all the

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,880
time so we're going to figure out what

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,530
it is that we need to do better

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,910
so it's continuously learning the

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:15,110
process in terms of the acceleration

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:18,270
what I've seen is that having the teams

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:22,320
work together collaborate together has a

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,510
great effect on DevOps because it

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,670
removes a lot of the communication

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,650
barrier right like emails I would just

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,620
kind of turn around and be like alright

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,840
I need to test this or this test fail so

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,300
you look at that I has a great

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,810
acceleration of time and when you bring

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,610
the teams in do the work the other

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,500
things that I've seen and I think was

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:48,390
echoed by a couple of the other speakers

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,220
was that the product work is really

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,980
important to DevOps

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,640
it's really important to others and why

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,100
as well as how you doing I've seen a lot

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,740
of engineers when I walk the hallway all

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,560
they talk about is the tech like hey

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,660
Venetian I want to do docker ok why do

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,100
you want to do those cuz I can split it

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,980
easy to in three ways right

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,340
that's just like what are you doing why

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,070
are you doing who does a bit of benefit

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,140
so I've seen I've seen by combining that

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,750
product word with the DevOps word it

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:29,230
changes their sentences makes them

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:30,669
focused on wiring in one case we

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,250
actually went down with a team in

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:37,179
Virginia and we paper prototype we

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:40,870
didn't even do it yet and we found that

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:44,159
all of their assumptions were wrong and

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:47,080
we and that idea project never even had

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,659
because just from the paper exercise

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,299
they found out that what they thought

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:56,679
that the user would do is completely

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:59,200
rejected by them so this kind of work is

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,409
and should be something that we all

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,480
focus on right we immediately started

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:10,240
going in to figure out if it's really

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:15,549
the right thing that's one of the things

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:17,470
we've learned so I think I'm good at

00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,440
time I know you all anxious to get the

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,179
lung so I've been fine to make it to

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,350
longer the talk but do you have a video

00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,350
to show you hopefully works

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,100
where all of their poor stakeholders

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,500
figure out the goals and objectives of

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,240
engagement work through a skills

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,550
assessment after we get through

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,350
chartering they do these rapid internet

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,350
sprints these mastery

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:58,520
we in the market has been

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:04,929
