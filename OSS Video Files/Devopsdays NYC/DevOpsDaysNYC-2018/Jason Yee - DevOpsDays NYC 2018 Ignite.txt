00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,910
how many people here like drinking

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,939
cocktails

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,980
yeah that's everybody this is awesome

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,550
how many people here like to make your

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,949
own cocktails fair number people how

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,740
many people here would rather just go to

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,480
a bar and have an amazing party cuz make

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,840
you a fabulous drink you don't have to

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,570
do anything it's that the feeling that's

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,059
most people the thing about cocktails is

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,620
you really don't have to go to a bar

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,010
there's no reason you can't make a

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,570
fantastic cocktail on your own and at

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,149
this point you're wondering what the

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,530
heck does this have to do with DevOps

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,539
well I'm Jason I'm a Technical

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,449
Evangelist at day to day and I have a

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,820
long history of giving food and drink

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,080
related ignite talks at DevOps days that

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,020
have passing relations to DevOps often

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,560
just questionable relations to DevOps so

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,240
just hang in there bear with me but if

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,799
you're if you're trying to build a great

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,850
cocktail or mix a great cocktail there

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,890
are a few things that you have to keep

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,439
in mind and the first is that a great

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,420
cocktail has balance great cocktails

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,220
need for things they need strong which

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,799
is going to be your liquor they need a

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,110
sweet sour and they'll often have a

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,060
bitter component and they need all of

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,250
these things in balance and this is

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,439
exactly why the extra dry vodka martini

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,439
is a horrible horrible

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,539
it's basically just vodka I mean bucket

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,920
is great and all but missing three of

00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,500
the four components that make a great

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,780
cocktail now if you're looking at

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,819
classic cocktails that are fantastic

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,859
things like negro knees Manhattan's

00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,079
daiquiris all of these have those four

00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,000
components of strong sweet sour and

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,859
usually bitter and that's what keeps

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,399
these cocktails super interesting and

00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,599
and makes them delightful to taste now

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,770
the other point that you need to

00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,869
remember when you're making a cocktail

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,149
is that you need to focus on good

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,099
ingredients obviously you don't want to

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,590
go too cheap and get bad ingredients bad

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,180
ingredients make for bad cocktails but

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,220
on the other hand you don't want to go

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,549
for great ingredients great ingredients

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,829
are expensive in fact things like

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,840
whiskey's rums tequila is all of those

00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,069
the really great ones they're great

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,620
because they have these really subtle

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,019
flavors and the subtle subtle flavors

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,430
and nuances get lost when you're trying

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,010
to make a cocktail when you mix them

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,170
with things now another point though is

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,299
that if you do have a spirit that has a

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,180
particularly interesting characteristic

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:42,000
like a smoky scotch or smoky mezcal or a

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,340
floral gin try to highlight those right

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,930
by combining other ingredients with

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,760
those you can help highlight those and

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,769
create complex flavors and I love this

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,930
quote from PDT which is a notable New

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,180
York bar you know there are adding

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,680
smoking best Calvin thinking about how

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,599
that can combine with food and creating

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,579
again more interesting flavors

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,440
interesting flavors make for great

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,019
cocktails

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,489
now when I say combining flavors you

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,010
know the way that you can do that is

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,450
simply to add one additional ingredient

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,880
to a cocktail that you've been making

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,400
forever or swap out one ingredient for

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,109
another those small little changes can

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,940
lead to new and exciting things for

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,609
example if you take a look at classic

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,709
cocktails an old fashioned really if you

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,200
just swap out that sugar cube replace it

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,359
with sweet vermouth you get a Manhattan

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,000
small really small change but an amazing

00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,820
change leads to

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,950
things my final point is that you should

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,080
talk to bartenders the next time you go

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,630
out and have a fabulous drink talk to a

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
bartender ask them about the ingredients

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,380
because that's really what they're

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,600
experts at is not mixing things but

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,670
understanding how ingredients all play

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,620
together and the best bartenders in the

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,750
world they're not the best bartenders

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,300
were just mixing drinks or knowing about

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,850
those ingredients they're experts and

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,190
they want to share that information

00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,500
so just to recap my my five points for

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,690
making a truly excellent cocktails the

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,570
first thing is that you need balance you

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,250
need strong sweet sour and bitter and if

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,530
you don't have all of those you're gonna

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,470
have a crappy cocktail so you need to

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,150
have all of those all together

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,130
the second point about making cocktails

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,040
is you really need to focus on good

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,230
don't go chasing great ingredients don't

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,480
spend all your money blow your budget on

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,450
that focus on the good stuff and then

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,610
build on top of that my third point

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,710
really though when you have those those

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,630
ingredients that have nuanced

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,479
characteristics things that are special

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,830
about them try to highlight those when

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,300
you're mixing those ingredients try to

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,820
join them with other ingredients that

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,330
can bring out the best of the

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,240
ingredients that you're using my fourth

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,370
really is that you should try to swap

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,020
out ingredients tribal adding just one

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,360
new ingredient to your cocktail because

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,729
that one little thing can change your

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,860
cocktail in amazing ways don't be afraid

00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,900
to experiment and try to swap things in

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,180
and out or add small things and the

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:06,830
final thing is really you know share

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,180
information talk to your bartenders they

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,860
know about ingredients they know how

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,820
they mix if you don't know about

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,930
ingredient ask your bartender thanks by

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,930
the way Dana dog is hiring

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:24,040
