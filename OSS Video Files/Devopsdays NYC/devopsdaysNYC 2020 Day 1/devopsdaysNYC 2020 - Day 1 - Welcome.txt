the code of conduct by the way anyone

could violate this accidentally and I

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,520

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,439

one another so thank you everybody for

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,870

I'm glad you're keeping them germs out

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,230
there so we had this really cute little

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,240
piece of art made that I think helps

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,420
represent what we think you need to do

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,610
swash your hands and shout out to Emily

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,510
with curls on Twitter for making these

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,459
great art with a great artwork so I have

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,110
some suggestions for you we did this

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,610
this morning we tested it out and it

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,250
works just in case you were wondering

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,600
how to greet someone without shaking

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,850
hands one here's another two we could

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,330
just do whatever you feel comfortable

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,730
doing with one or the other and then we

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,700
have the other option of how you do it

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,970
yeah yeah good all hey hey don't all

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,820
right so you know don't feel like you

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,920
have to do any sort of physical touch

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,269
it's not a thing that you need to and if

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,380
someone touches you you don't like it

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,280
there's the code of conduct

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,070
please let's respect one another cool

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,489
sweet all right

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,280
Wi-Fi take a picture it's on every wall

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,980

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,170
Wi-Fi it's right here

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,630
it's pretty easy that's it there's no

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,880
other explanation and now we got

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,600
ourselves on Twitter all the social

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,090

us know how you enjoy everything it's

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,590
really great to echo what we've been up

just want to make sure that you know

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,140
that we have a slack and this is a great

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:22,990
way to get announcements of what's

happening today you can get there by

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,910

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,360

days of incredible content I hope to see

00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:51,440
you in all of the sessions very cool so

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:54,080
open spaces with Aaron and submit who

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,740
has been to a DevOps days and done open

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,509
spaces cool if you haven't those are the

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,770
rules you're gonna learn a lot more

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:05,120
about it during the session I think it

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,460
should be really great

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,130
yeah the open spaces are one of the best

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,930
times of the conference outside of our

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,599
amazing speakers who are looking at me

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,690
like what what do you say so open spaces

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,460
are great for you to have a conversation

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,080
that you want it to have and you didn't

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,240
get the chance because there wasn't a

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,090
topic there wasn't a talk you can create

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,219
your own open space topic think of those

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,840
ideas well before lunch so that we can

00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:33,469
get them out on the board and get voted

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,810
on so we're gonna start getting ready

00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:39,050
