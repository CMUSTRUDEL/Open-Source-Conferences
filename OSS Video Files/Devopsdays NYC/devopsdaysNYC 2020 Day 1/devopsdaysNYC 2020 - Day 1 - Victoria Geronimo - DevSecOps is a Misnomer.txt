Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 1 - Victoria Geronimo - DevSecOps is a Misnomer
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: devopsdaysNYC 2020 Day 1
Description: 
	DevSecOps is a misnomer. The idea that Security is smashed in between Dev and Ops is exactly the problem we face. Many believe security is the blocker before getting their application out to production. Owned by some distant, unapproachable team, security can seem like the new deep divide with a ‘throw it over the wall’ mentality.

Instead, Security must be sprinkled throughout the DevOps cycle, taught from the beginning when developing best practices, and owned by the entire team. In this talk, I will share 1 slide that overlays exactly where Security fits in the “DevSecOps” pipeline and culture and pipeline touching on specific challenges companies face, and the things they do to address those challenges from Threat Modeling and Risk Classification, Security Education, Automated Policy Enforcement, Secrets Management, Vulnerability Scanning, SAST and DAST, monitoring, and more.

all right so how many people have heard

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,630
the term devstack ops before and how

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,279
many people actually know what that

00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,390
means or what it entails or feel like

00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,369
they've implemented it successfully it's

00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,070
because probably DevOps is a misnomer

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,559
which I'll be talking about today and

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,000
that pretty much means that there's a

00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,489
lot more that goes into it than you

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,830
would think my name is viktoria Geronimo

00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:45,430
I work at second watch I am a product

00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:48,190
manager in my previous lives I have been

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,960
head of InfoSec at a fin tech startup we

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,860
did some like data analysis that sort of

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,110
thing so this is the typical status quo

00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,510
you have your devops team which is all

00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,979
about collaboration automation

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,479
reliability and then you have your

00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:03,790
security team which is all about

00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,500
checking the code looking for

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,960
vulnerabilities running scans and

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,549
sending it back to DevOps problems with

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,689
this are that a lot of stuff gets lost

00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:12,820
in translation

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,650
the teams are typically siloed they

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,950
don't talk a lot except when security is

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,289
throwing it back over to DevOps DevOps

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,240
people don't know security and my last

00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:25,659
job none of the developers even knew

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,979
what a wasp was and then with security

00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:29,289
they don't know DevOps they don't

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,179
understand how the flow is supposed to

00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,799
work and that it's all about speed so

00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,619
there's just a lot that goes into it

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,170
that gets lost you don't want to just

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,880
insert security into DevOps and then

00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,320
walk away and call it a day because it's

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,630
gonna break everything it's gonna break

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,899
that DevOps cycle so it's really about

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,729
how do we collaborate and how do we

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,520
insert different parts of security into

00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,899
the DevOps cycle kind of like how

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,229
development teams and Operations teams

00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,969
merge to become DevOps to do it right

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,670
you have to do a multi-tiered

00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:02,499
multi-pronged solution that requires a

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,030
few different elements but two of the

00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:06,579
main things that a lot of people don't

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,569
think about are that people mean two

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,640
different things when they talk about

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:12,220
DevOps one is gonna be your

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,650
configuration so your top-down policies

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,260
that get pushed a code in terms of

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,180
infrastructure and then your actual CIC

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,760
D pipeline so these are two things that

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,240
you need to consider both in tandem as

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,740
well as separately there are three

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,360
things that go into it and it's going to

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,980
be people process and

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,740
technology so one is going to be the

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,940
training one is going to be tools that

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,610
you're inserting into your build

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,620
pipeline after this you're going to see

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,380
the lovely infinity symbol of dev

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,300
suck-ups and then you also want to make

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,730
sure that from a top-down perspective

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,380
you're an agreement on infrastructure

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:53,320
changes and how code gets pushed so here

00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,630
we have our deployment model and for

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,150
building code or the dev ops pipeline

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,360
and then the number systems are where

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,890
you want to put in your different

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,080
security tooling so this pertains to

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,720
more of the build pipeline the CI CD

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,489
pipeline and then the tools from a plan

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,040
stage you want to make sure that you

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,410
have a threat modeling system going

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,660
where you're meeting once a week or once

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,090
a month to talk about threats that are

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,410
possible to your system what the impact

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,110
will be in the likelihood of them

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,020
occurring so that you can figure out how

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,550
to build your code around that in terms

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,459
of the actual coding you want to be

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,860
doing things like ie as well as peer

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,620
review which is a huge thing get lab

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,870
github they all have controls now where

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,060
you can say hey this person can't pull

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,650
code they can't merge code unless it

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,480
gets peer reviewed and that always

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,580
should just be a check from your system

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,120
that security team is making sure is put

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,799
in the build pipeline or sorry the code

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,799
for building you want to make sure you

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,590
have hard an image and then with in

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,260
static analysis which basically means

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,420
it's checking your code for any known

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,220
vulnerabilities and the test age you

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,049
want to do your dynamic code analysis

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,340
which is going to be weave around our

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,690
code is it calling out to any sort of

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,549
servers we don't know about that's where

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,709
a lot of Bitcoin mining operation

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,840
happens in the early stage you want to

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,310
be doing automated key rotation which is

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,650
a big thing we see in security

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,870
assessments no one has not nobody but a

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,050
lot of people do are not rotating their

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,790
keys automatically and then you also

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,680
want to be doing vulnerability scanning

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,930
at that stage as well something running

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,850
it through qala services in the deploy

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,890
stage you just want to be controlling

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,599
repositories that can auto deploy as I

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,090
talked automation is a big factor in

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:41,010
DevOps so you just want to make sure you

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,800
understand exactly

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,930
what's running at all times and then in

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,900
your operate stage you want to have run

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,150
time protection rasp is a fairly new

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,340
thing that's been picking up speed and

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,460
that's gonna give you some real zero-day

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,810
protection against known vulnerabilities

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,150
that are coming out as well as being

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,190
context aware and then in your monitor

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,990
stage you want to do configuration

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,480
change monitoring this is where a lot of

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,250
your typical security team come in

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,740
operation so you're going to be doing

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,790
network monitoring anomaly monitoring

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,490
your seam services there so that is a

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,800
very very quick overview of a very big

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,180
topic that we could go into you can find

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,710
me at the second watch piece later today

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,460
and I will talk your head off all about

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,540
it but thank you for having me

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:41,839
[Applause]

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:41,839
