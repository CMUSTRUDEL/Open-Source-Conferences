here is Michael any music organizer jobs

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,420
in chicago and enjoy strawberry pie

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,740
outdoors makeover jacket and the talk

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,960
here is the innovation in a creative

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,130
company let me hit the start button are

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,770
you ready I am ready the other way go

00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:21,630
cool so my name is my name I work in an

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,430
agency called critical mass we're a

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,410
digital experience design agency with

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,300
relentless focus on the customer we're

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,880
comprised of four primary disciplines

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,619
strategy design technology marketing

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,130
science we work together to design

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,600
experiences for large brands so we're

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,969
another technology company but as a

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,739
digital agency technology is essential

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,629
totally deliver i like to say the

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,730
software is the delivery mechanism for

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,379
brand experiences and our challenge is

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,989
to have disciplines work together in a

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,449
way to deliver innovative you have the

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,879
two ative experiences creating cultures

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,590
where they discipline critical for the

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,449
disciplines work together to innovate is

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,219
difficult creating a kata that we

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,070
practice across disciplines has been

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,780
exceedingly difficult now if you've been

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,489
part of the DevOps community for a while

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,100
to be familiar with the lessons of

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,570
deming go round short and wealth found

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,450
their teachings of statistical process

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,010
control system of profound knowledge in

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,689
theory of constraints valuable they

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,990
alone are insufficient to unlocking

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,610
innovation and our organization when we

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,409
look at what price and delivers value of

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,200
an organization we find communication

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,930
empathy and inclusivity you may be

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,520
thinking like yeah but I assure you that

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,320
if it was that simple our theme for go

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,390
upstate New York would not be what it is

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,130
and I would in the spent time

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,690
so when we look at what one of the ways

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,310
i look at communication is surprise

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,260
adduction people like to know what's

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,780
going on in what to expect secrecy is

00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,340
toxic we've all experienced this whether

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,020
it's not knowing enough context for an

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,450
assignment simply not knowing that a

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,100
project is underway it seems intuitive

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,930
to keep all this in a loop but so far as

00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,729
reduction is more than that it's about

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,560
understanding what you already know that

00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,930
others may not and anticipating their

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,970
needs this takes a level of effort that

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,250
goes beyond common sense but it's well

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,080
worth the energy when everyone is on the

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,240
same page it's more likely that you'll

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,310
get diverse created contribution from

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,680
all the disciplines innovation sprouts

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,160
from this proactive communication it

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,290
just seems to make common sense i found

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,360
that curiosity is another key quality

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,220
for nurturing innovation when you're

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,140
curious you want to know how things work

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,840
you want to know what motivates people

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,790
and i believe curiosity to be made

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,790
quality of intrinsically motivated

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,959
people curiosity is driven designers to

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,400
learn how to use the weapons web

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,170
director of glass it's driven

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,959
information architects to understand how

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,900
JavaScript and CSS power animations and

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,430
I drove me to learn about operations

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,380
these are these pieces on the screen

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,030
were created by my cousin Sarah Walker

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,800
perhaps insulted and work in Brooklyn

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,110
and these pieces were inspired about how

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,450
technology is interwoven itself into our

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,280
lives there's one thing you think remote

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,769
for this talk reflect on your own

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,600
curiosities and act on those interests

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,489
if you know someone with that talent or

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,830
knowledge ask them about it start a

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,019
conversation then put yourself on the

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,549
other side of that interaction when

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,790
you're the physician to answer questions

00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:12,680
or teach please please please take the

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,090
time to do so continuing the

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,440
conversation will start a relationship

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,050
that lasts much longer in the dialogue

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,640
early in my career I didn't really value

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,590
sharing I wasn't confident enough to

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,020
share work in progress and documentation

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,240
wasn't valid until valued until after it

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,040
was needed as I'm insured I came to

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,660
understand how sharing enables the

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,940
organization to gain knowledge as a

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,440
whole I came to understand much more

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,020
holistically that the creative process

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,970
depends on sharing I still struggle with

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,380
how to keep the sharing feedback loop

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,690
going throughout the creative process

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:49,110
but the Chicago voting mantra applies

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,220
share early Cheryl commandment of

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,780
communication curiosity and sharing

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,030
ladder into what I believe to be a

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,460
higher-order humanistic quality empathy

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,730
and put these understandings sharing and

00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,580
feelings of another empathy is requisite

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,160
to innovation and good design is rooted

00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,510
in empathy imagine trying designer

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,640
product without understanding the

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,910
motivation of the consumer okay that's

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,990
kind of a herd of but consider the value

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,359
understanding and sharing an emotional

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,570
need to both your consumers and your

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:21,100
fellow team members at critical mass we

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,780
not only consider how the software may

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,850
be received by the operators for example

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,160
but also think of it that way across

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,020
discipline lines contextualizing

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,460
decision with an anecdote will not

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,260
hiding the details that other

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,110
disciplines can relate to what we do in

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,180
technology now inclusivity is not to be

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,280
discounted in two is requisite to

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,050
innovation ensuring your culture is

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,120
aware of exclusive behavior and

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,820
discourages it well allow more diverse

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,620
set of contributors and will ultimately

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,100
lead to greater perspective and thereby

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,270
animation the creative process

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,800
supporting structures and empathetic

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,440
culture will never be available as a

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,030
service are written this code but we can

00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,810
most certainly apply the values that we

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:13,660
hold dear the DevOps community to

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:13,660
