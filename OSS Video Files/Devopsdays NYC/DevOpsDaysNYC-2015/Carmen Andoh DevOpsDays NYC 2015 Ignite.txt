all right our first ignite speaker today

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,200
is an awesome woman I met at the new

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,830
ladies who links me up here in New York

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,099
so early in July clinics come find me

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,619
afterwards we can get involved in that

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:19,560
she is a assistant who also practices

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:31,590
pops gonna talk to you about that today

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:33,420
here is carbon on diversi-tech that's

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:49,590
how I read more moments can help the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:52,350
gender and that means that whether or

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,090
not you choose to buy into it how to say

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,860
it's your decision it's a very personal

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,989
decision I wanted to say that there's

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,230
nothing like that I'm trying to treat

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,629
mine on but the reality of 81 percent of

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,220
women choose by the timing in

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,159
childbearing age choose to have kids

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,600
with eight out of ten and that means

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,430
that when we talk about women in tech

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,310
we're gonna have to eventually talk

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,979
about mothers in tech now most of you in

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,630
this room and everything along but

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,119
you're going to be apartment you or

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,100
caregivers co-partner to someone it

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,380
might be a mom or my fale hiring manager

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,049
they could hire home so that's why I

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,710
think it's relevant to all of us if you

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:37,439
have a mom working mom and think about

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,270
all the things that she does so they're

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,340
asking me how often it was a routine

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,470
saving different projects for fall under

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,479
stress create systems that work get them

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,430
out the door many wrongs roll the

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,659
punches there naturals that continuous

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,060
integration and continuous deployment

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,189
date available getting three kids out

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,710
the door lunch is made to school always

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,689
passes and because we've actually more

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:06,420
often than we can count but I rarely do

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:08,610
get downtime chances for us to really

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,450
really really involve ourselves in the

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,520
tech world and I

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,230
chop that there are four mothers getting

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,370
involved in from up with all the tools

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,750
that are out there and all the

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,640
technologies out there everything

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,860
Bridget talked about regards to remote

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,269
the absolutely can make it happen we

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,400
could even move to the suburbs and world

00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,989
without rural areas without defending

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,970
courage or some kind of career killer

00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:33,190
especially urban areas all some of the

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,560
things that commutative offices in quiz

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,910
giving an integrated mindset and deeply

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,459
care is just as much about the people

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,430
and understand that silos and closed

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:45,459
systems just to not work so why do we

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,010
compartmentalize our lives I didn't try

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,989
so hard to keep work and home separate

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,610
in every way I'm not talking about

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,010
syncing your off speed route to your

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,290
baby monitor or duct tape is her LoJack

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,730
at school no Goodman's but would have

00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,060
been aggressive to and actually a good

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,910
thing

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,769
look at this year our natural nervous

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,329
system in our career best in the system

00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,610
they're separate but they have to be

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,769
integrated when we die and so that's a

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,220
good thing that nature knows this why

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,220
can't we

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,260
so a little bit more about on rethinking

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,329
how our experiences at home and rich and

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,400
warm our experiences at work we need a

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,049
better partner and colleague both the

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,239
efforts to integrate make me better

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,880
I'm much better at conflict resolution

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,790
as you can see here resilience empathy

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,920
humor sometimes I have to confront I'm

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,920
not a confront everybody someone like

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,480
you the line is gonna come help but I

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,250
also gave me teacher training and that

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,959
is helping you work as well I think all

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,549
of us have to kind of have those moments

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,329
and be comfortable with those moments I

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:49,260
wasn't before I was a mother to know

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,870
what's the wisely exercised are our

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,720
permissions as group right because I

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,599
think that's something that happens to

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,310
us all the time when we read this

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,290
infographic is really important to me

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,349
because we also got an either/or

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:08,079
proposition either along or in work

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,769
attention can be both but we have long

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,359
lives

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:11,739
we're gonna be living a long time if you

00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,150
look at this we're going to be a lot of

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,400
different things in a lot of ways I'm

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,979
going to be doing it simultaneously so

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,099
we're going to be both parents a partner

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:23,170
are going to work and if you look the

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,720
parent timelines we actively

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:30,400
apparently the washer earth is a working

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,970
time line and - slow and steady wins the

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,850
race

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,490
and you know I look at the retirement

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:40,060
age it's being moved up to probably 70

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,580
by 2050 we got 35 years left at work

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,990
but I only have maybe 10 12 years left

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,020
and actively being involved with

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,030
utilized before they fly the coop

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,940
so the regrets of the dying I'm sorry

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,740
all about how the awesome at work we're

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,020
never going to regret on our deathbeds

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,300
that we do work harder or we did have

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,140
better uptime we didn't you know have

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,520
better go son past so I wanted to get a

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,090
gentle reminder that limits like fears

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,710
often illusion we're only partial to the

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,570
limits that we place upon ourselves

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,840
so anything you want to talk about

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:17,160
Parenthood it's on your mind tell me

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,440
about it I have special needs kids

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,080
autism type 1 diabetes spina bifida I

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,550
mean when I talk about mamas I'm deep in

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,550
