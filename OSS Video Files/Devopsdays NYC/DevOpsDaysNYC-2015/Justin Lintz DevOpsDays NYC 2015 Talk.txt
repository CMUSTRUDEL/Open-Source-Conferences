00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,920
John was saying one in fee people in the

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,080

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,310
other mental health and confunde staff

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,720
for that but is extremely common there's

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,890
probably some other folks and throop and

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,810
suffer from one who didn't want to raise

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,110
their hand and you know it's hard to get

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,489
it I've been there here to talk a little

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,780
bit about my illness you know I have

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:02,640
something called generalized anxiety

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,890
disorder like doing a talk on anxiety so

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,810
you know my symptoms appeared around I

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,510
was 13 and I was officially diagnosed

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,489
when I was 17 and reason why I like I

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,440
say I realized actually had it for as

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,930
long as I did because I didn't really

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,310
have any idea like what anxiety was like

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,920
I know that was a thing that someone

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,840
could suffer from when I was in high

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,549
school around I think sophomore year so

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,250
it started just wake up every morning

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,989
with maybe selling games ISM and it kind

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,430
of just disappear by the afternoon and

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,900
like this went on for months and months

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,579
like the doctor about it they're like

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,109
there's nothing we're all feeling very

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,640
great but like you still at the stomach

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,910
pains you shouldn't really think about

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,829

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,569
with the stomach pains had come back and

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,299

gut-wrenching pain and you know i didn't

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,000
realize what this was at the time was

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,010
anxiety until i started talking to a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,359
therapist around 17 for really stuff

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,650
like I'm related just kind of talking

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,170
about parents force and stuff like that

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,090
and you know just talking about going to

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,709
college as I how come college stuff and

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,269
talking about the very feeling aged

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,920
about that I kind of started late diving

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,840
into like the symptoms of anxiety and

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,070
like what would start like poking up a

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,600
whole bunch of like things that like

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,970
explaining things I never actually

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,440
realized before I was like only this

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,240
thing I used to have interest like

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,260
that could have been anxiety I mean sure

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,180
they could have been a medical reason

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,910
for it but like you know kind of put two

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,470
and two together there um when my

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,600
anxiety was at its worst i did take

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,510
medication for it I took what's a pro

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,980
and some Zoloft lexapro side effects I

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,900
can sleep on it so I take this other

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,550
medication called remeron which anyway

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,140
if anyone's are taking that if it makes

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,060
me eat a ton which was kind of awesome

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,140
because I'm like a thin version um you

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,000
know I kinda actually like that side

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,500
thing but you know it also would knock

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,210

tweet the other day like an app to tell

00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,430

attack you keep saying that that's just

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,230
like really a sudden concept of some of

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,450
those symptoms I said a combination of

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,430
them a lot of times they has don't

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,680
trigger a reason for it like might be

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,750
walking down the street oh oh

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,250
I'm laughing about it but like in that

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,720
moment it's like terribly and you can

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,130
get this fight or flight response like

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
you can sit there and deal with it or

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,190
you can kind of like bold you know I can

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,810

so it was a little early because working

00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,159

like normal project else's Justin my

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,550

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,969
started tingling my face was tingling

00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,229
was that the mold from the coffee cake

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:21,689
that was causing it was it like exactly

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,610
and at this time I I knew I had anxiety

00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,439
and hidden you about this problem so you

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,659
know even though I knew that's what it

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,749
was so you know what do i do it go into

00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,249
Google I start like can you die from and

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:34,259
you know it's like Yahoo Answers comes

00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:36,599
up or some like that and like yes you

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,159
can it's like I'm not a doctor but Yahoo

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,129
Answers has never solved a medical

00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:43,259
problem like just go ahead and put like

00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,240
it's a local host and Etsy hosts like

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,519
blocking on your bottom it tastes

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,180
terrible I'm sorry to j1 from yahoo here

00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,800
it's bad um so anyway I end up calling

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,269
me poison control's those freaky I was

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,709
alone in my dorm like there was no house

00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:57,209
in the dorms there's like rescue keys

00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,039
Justin killed my coffee cake like

00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,809
they're gonna fire here like next which

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,180
propagate every mold leg up here's how

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:04,769
it happened and you know I call poison

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,209
told her like no it's fine like you're

00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:07,679
so much going to digest it but even

00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:09,179
after that like still you know still

00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,499
tingling everything like that I'd take

00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:12,779
like a klonopin to really calm myself

00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:15,329
down and like all right you know it's

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,789
not a big deal but that's really you

00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,079
know a good example of a bank so you

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,879
know just because it's all the symptoms

00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,019
before like I'm sure once we might come

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,939
crap i felt that they're being anxious

00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,309
just like looking at the slides does it

00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,839
mean like you know you had anxieties or

00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:31,319
there's good anxiety and there's bad

00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,000
anxiety all anxiety is just a warning

00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,180
system to your body it's like this huge

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,680
adrenaline rush and a huge surge of

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,969
start a surge of adrenaline it just

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,800
helped prepare you for something whether

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,060
it's like going in front of a bunch of

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,540
people at dev ops today to talk about

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,920
anxiety or boarding a flight or maybe

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,160
like you know you're stepping into the

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,160
ring for a boxing match

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,620
that um it's you know it's good tag

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,750
anxiety it's nothing wrong with that I'm

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,069
not a doctor I'm not gonna be able to

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,810
tell you whether or not you know it's

00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,910
good or bad it's a job with a mental

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,350
health professional some days I barely

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,740
feel like I'm system in so i don't know

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,480
if they can help you with that but so

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,649
you know now that kind of you give you a

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,750
little introduction for like anxiety

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,519
some things like that I just want to

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,680
talk about some of those anxieties and

00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,149
stressors of working in a job of

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,149
operations because it's a pretty

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,560
stressful job um for these next few

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,879
slides have been introduced you to a lot

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,589
of concepts as you probably not even

00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,389
introduce you you probably heard them

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,160
ready but I want you to think about them

00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:28,990
in terms of anxiety you've probably been

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,430
introduced them in a different form but

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,779
you realize like now that you've hurdle

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,980
that like well well just get actually

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,209
really help someone that has anxiety

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,740
issues and even if you don't have

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,769
anxiety issues it tastes like a huge

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,600
load bangs eyes you up here the first

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,819
thing is just being alcohol right like

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,470
you get asian bill and ate like there's

00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,360
no such thing as a good page someone's

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,500
paging of eat someone's broken they're

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,269
not paging you say okay youtube Justin I

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,949
still remember the first time I was on

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,540
call when I work with Mike and like I

00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,040
was up all night like every 15 minutes

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,779
like checking my phone we could go up

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,519
not very good I couldn't sleep at all

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,079
just like you know but the ringtone

00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,899
still haunts me today I can't hear it

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,100
like major chemistry it's treo 650 like

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:11,050
I just we have two in the middle tonight

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,670
jump into like this complex problem and

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,810
like start problem solving at like three

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,430
in the morning you have to go from zero

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,230
to 60 it'd be like all right you know

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,720
start putting like pieces of a puzzle

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,670
together being like you know how what's

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,410
going on here like it how do i fix this

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,959
like oh the site's down like I'm

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,910
gonna give me a fired and you know you

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,889
have van on Paul weeks I've just had one

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,420
last week I can have more while I can do

00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,309
a sleep I was miserable off just like

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,589
you know dealing with fires left them

00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:37,209
right and you know the lack of sleep

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,680
itself just elevates the stress even

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,209
further you go on the next day and

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,480
really more sensitive to everything

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:45,910
that's going around you so maintenance

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,230
windows another long you know sometimes

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,300
you don't even have time to prepare for

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,889
these maintenance windows open SSL like

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,809
most like every other boss were and I'm

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,189
a passionate hopefully everyone's pretty

00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,899
much automated it so like don't you

00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,490
designing a big deal anymore but you

00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,430
know there's even no matter how many

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,100
times you were her

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,720
Nathan's window like it's just things go

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,210
wrong like you just can't be prepared

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
for what happens you know one of these

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,020
favorite maintenance to perform and it's

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,330
so easy it's just changing dns providers

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,130
just updating name servers but i still

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,620
freaking copy and paste like in your

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,779
name servers and like the web UI and i

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,610
just like double triple quadruple check

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,290
in life you know and I'm worried like

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,880
the moment I hit like enter I'm showing

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,680
full my keyboard and like hit some weird

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,690
letters and like myself on nameservers

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,430
wrong it 48 hours we're stuck just

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:32,870
waiting for like the NFL you fix itself

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:37,310
because terrible I one of these pplz not

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,020
I guess that's another top new

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,880
technology all the time you know we have

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,470
to stay up to date balls new technology

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,089
and like everything's changing every few

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,180
years 10 years build stuff I knew it was

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:49,100
like barely relevant anymore you know

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,839
maybe like one day you upgrade your OS

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,670
and you found and find a leithian it

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:58,790
systems been ripped out something that I

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,589
mean sorry get real life examples but

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,480
you just have deal pick a new set of

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,220
problems and unknowns all the time like

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,300
you're you know here's Holly deorbited

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,010
data store that's gonna do all these

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,020
great things and it would handle network

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:14,150
partitions and Kyle things very Ephraim

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,890
like note both just a job with constant

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,360
learning it always is no really

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,300
stressful to kind of deal with all the

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,400
time um you know being an ops team one

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,589
Jeremy talk about this in this lighting

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,050
talk yesterday that's really tough like

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,610
tell the world on your shoulders you see

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,950
this flat small startups or anything

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,240
like that like you're you're responsible

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,070
for sometimes you're responsible for the

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,260
desktop support your possible the server

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,730
is responsible for who knows what

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,709
happens you know and i'll talk a little

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,600
bit more about this in a later slide but

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:45,440
you just stare this cute puppy for a

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,560
second if you want move on you have a

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,360
lot of power and responsibility of like

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,250
you've got room on all your systems and

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,600
you could like easily screw up and do

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,890
something about that you've run the

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,110
wrong command and you're wiping out

00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,410
something you're not paying attention

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,290
one day literally three weeks ago I blew

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,940
away my OSX laptop I was trying to

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,430
remove a directory called private in my

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,050
home directory and I you know they took

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,990
about ten years for this to finally

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,480
happen for some reason i read sudo RM

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,700
erf / private instead of private and

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,980
apparently / privates of directory on

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,070
OSX and it's a very important directory

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,870
a lot of important things in it and like

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,459
you know I feel like my CEOs in crush me

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,630
and like can you just Google and tell me

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,730
if like this directories important

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,100
aesthetics and reinstall spent all day

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,959
reinstall you know you just don't think

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,399
it's tough years light all right the

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,020
first you know when i joined courses

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,300
might get was like my first couple days

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,950
was setting up root access to like all

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,550
these servers and like you're giving me

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:48,140
i'm straight out of college i doing what

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,550
am I like couple things after you know

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,870
like now there's sufficient stressed you

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,300
allowed like why the hell am I getting

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,589
operations begin with like let's talk

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,420
about wait if you can actually minimize

00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,200
some of this life now it's not all that

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:03,050
bad well sometimes um so these next few

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,640
slides are going to detail ways you know

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,399
you can alleviate a lot of these

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,100
stresses and things like that um sorry

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,630
after you listen sesam so bored but

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,410
let's take a look at some ways we can

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:18,500
minimize anxiety so don't be an ops team

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,089
of one and that doesn't mean you're the

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,550
only person with operations in your

00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,140
title when i joined charpy there was no

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,149
other person with operations in their

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,829
title that didn't mean no one else

00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,300
there's performing operations the reason

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,370
why I still took the job was because

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,260
people were writing the wrong manifest

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,720
engineers went on puppet manifest they

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,430
were writing their own nagios alerts

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,230
they were participating the on-call

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,000
rotation I wasn't going to be the only

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,829
person going in there and be like here's

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,920
the pager good blockout bit my

00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:47,870
up our health is really important to you

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,339
it's it's really stressful with

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,040
everything just thrown on your shoulders

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,990
and people expect you to do all this you

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,880
know if you find a company that has

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,110
these expectations of like you're going

00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,120
to be the only person with Hobbs you're

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,600
the only person alcohol just walk away

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,390
from it the law of two feet so

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,279
controlled burn it's essentially a

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,320
little torch all states and we're doing

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,149
actual burn so those of you familiar

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,770
with controlled burns Netflix kind of

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,450
made them a little popular with chaos

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,060
monkey we're just kind of randomly shuts

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:19,040
down parts of your infrastructure we

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,589
start doing these HR peterbrown say

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,410
maybe a year ago and what we do is you

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,470
know we kind

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,940
around a table so we just pick service

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,769
to bring down like all right we're going

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,620
to like just shut this down and see what

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,420
happens oh did it fail as expected you

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,160
know this highly true today's door that

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,509
we set up says like all right you know

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,660
it will keep running the moment I shut

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:42,060
this other note down this keep running I

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,410
retest periodically like there's we had

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,269
you know a couple control burns from my

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,860
god you know I know we bring down one of

00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:48,180
these API servers like it's not going to

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,230
be a big deals and a little bounce or

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,149
something that will be able to bring up

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,889
in your mode someone you know may be

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,839
made a change like puppet manifest that

00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,430
leg baby broke the ability to bring up a

00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,319
new server and you find that out it was

00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,759
like oh you know got a little cocky with

00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,350
getting like controlled burns done like

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,079
even the stuff you things going to go

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,459
well sometimes just doesn't go well you

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,019
know maybe if your systems or designs

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:11,009
that can heal themselves automatically

00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:13,170
that actually work so did the correct

00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,300
monitors even go off do you even have

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,250
monitors and place for that service and

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,930
find that out a lot to do too many

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,850
monitors go off you bring that one

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,860
server and you get like 40 pages like uh

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,629
like this isn't helping anyone the only

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,699
beast needs set up with your kind of

00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:32,040
deep operating maybe okay so what's

00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:33,810
availability affected sometimes this is

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,490
a known thing at the time you're like

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,230
all right I know if I bring down this

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,509
single point of failure database all our

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,459
sites going to go down other times you

00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,170
know I just bring down the API server

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,579
they shouldn't have been affected but

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,709
also we find out they call there's a

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,910
huge spike in errors that was really you

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,259
know something you should tweet are low

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,079
bounce or health check settings so it

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,689
pulls in a little more faster you know

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,949
let's face it most of us are at a place

00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:58,110
with our infrastructure where everything

00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,360
is a hundred percent like you know fault

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,279
tolerant systems find new and complex

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,799
ways all the times to fail and like

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,169
dramatic fashions it's terrible and it

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,120
does but you know it's part of our jobs

00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:10,890
is kind of like insinuating that like

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,049
ongoing battle of trying to figure out

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,939
what's going on and blame those post

00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,799
mortems right everyone's probably heard

00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,480
about those at this point I don't really

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,520
need to spend much time on it sweetie

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,500
check out a few weeks about it but they

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,780
might it you know you have anxiety so

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,850
like that just taking the stress on your

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,860
shoulders of life you're going to break

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,330
something right ladies it's a given like

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,309
you have root on your systems you're

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,780
going to shut down wrong server might

00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,950
and I will we work together there's a

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,810
few sets of servers

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,450
your names are slightly different based

00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:41,430
on uterine dash or like a 01 or just

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,230
hold on and chain a nose to it was J

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,520
work the same company I shut down the

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,200
wrong server one day in a datacenter

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,820
moments like this there's three

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
variations of that literally through all

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,180
different servers and their main like

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,790
something off by own character called

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,960
the power off yeah that happens but you

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,880
know you take away the punishment from

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,840
that because it's bound to happen so

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,010
checklist another great thing if

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,810
anyone's ever read this book the

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,710
checklist manifesto it's pretty great

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:11,610
really as you read this guy actual I'm

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:14,220
sorry that's it he is a doctor he went

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,320
to a bunch of hospitals and kind of just

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,420
started like like learning the about

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,770
link surgeries and how those performed

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,810
and just learning Valley Middle West

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,520
days and like infection rate and just

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,840
like things like basic things like

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,040
doctors forgetting to wash your hands

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,500
because they just now have a checklist

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,060
of things to do before surgery even gets

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,470
into submitters and stuff with airline

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,000
pilots and like how they all have

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,920
checklists for all sorts of events that

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,720
happen and just about how to create a

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,610
checklist like a checklist doesn't have

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,960
to be this huge detailed stats like you

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,730
have played butcher some stuff like that

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,980
but just you know I did this the other

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,900
week we were just mount hold rating for

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,130
some new engineers going to call and I'm

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,660
like you know writing is talking my

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,760
vision which you through this interview

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,230
ourselves like you know having have just

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,150
a general list of like all right when

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,530
you get page here's what to do here's

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,330
some steps so at three in the morning

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,560
your brain could start waking up and

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,750
you're just like all right I have to

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,650
acknowledge the alert I can look at nah

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,090
do see what else is probably critical

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,920
here's you know wherever you find this

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,300
here's where you find the playbooks for

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,430
this alert you know is this specific

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,830
thing act on it and just like things

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,680
like that like you just go to autopilot

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,060
mode and it's just like a huge huge like

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,360
relief to build it just little bit

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,490
something to follow it so just having

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,500
training continuum created you can know

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,750
how to use your existing tools like does

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,160
everyone who's on call no like that

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,930
gangly it has like your system level

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,240
metrics that graphite has your

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,830
application vendors do they know that

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,330
log stash has all your logs they know

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,190
how to query log stash they know that

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,870
query graph I like to be able to find

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,210
what they're doing for because like they

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,710
can't do it at like 1pm on a Friday they

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,930
can't do it at three in the morning when

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,200
like you know you're barely a week you

00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,880
know or maybe like your school

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,580
currently being up in bars don't do that

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,350
when you're in Paul I just you know you

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,850
want to continue like expand your your

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,169
tool set as well like there's Unix

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,580
commands that I'm learning all the time

00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,649
from going conferences like this that I

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,210
no idea ever existed like there's so

00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:03,309
many little late to let our Unix

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,960
commands at no idea I'm just talking to

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,970
the vendors themselves right the goal is

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,440
new technology we're dealing with like

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,539
you just learn from them like the

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,760
gotchas that I just are unexpected but

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,340
they say like you know look after this

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,809
when you're deploying whatever on ec2

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,970
and you know if you're running on harbor

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,139
do this like there's going to be all

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,889
these different things that you have to

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:25,659
be aware of having an alcohol partner

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,639
this is actually my giant rubber dog in

00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:30,659
my apartment is a problem about this big

00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:33,700
so we have primary secondary oncall

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,769
rotations at sharpie and you know if it

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,330
doesn't if like I don't acknowledge you

00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:39,519
learn time they will escalate on to the

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,200
seminary but this also provides a good

00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,880
wave like you know you get page and just

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,350
freeze up make it run tassels moments

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,389
you're like oh I don't know what's going

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,789
on like I can't think straight right now

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:50,710
you know baby freaking out about it you

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,389
should call them up okay I need a second

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,789
set of hands I can you hop online hop on

00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:56,769
hipchat slack whatever and you know like

00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,299
how many times also later rubber duck

00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:59,440
debugging how many times you start

00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,760
talking with the coworker about a

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,440
problem and then Wilson you're like oh

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,519
 like that's how you do it what do

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,779
you talk about it doesn't matter so this

00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,980
is like this is you know from my

00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:11,950
apartment I've just duck I talked to

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:17,620
sometimes in life it's it's you know

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,330
that duck could be a person so um so

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,070
talking to your employer about mental

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,889
health and this is really tough thing to

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,539
do but maybe not are going to do it it's

00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:27,519
hard because you know maybe they won't

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,019
understand it it takes time to really

00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,880
build up a comfort level breathing just

00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,799
go to someone and just be like hey like

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,779
I have a problem deal with like I can

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,399
still do my job but like every now and

00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:39,279
then I may need some like accommodations

00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:40,510
made for dealing with stuff and like you

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,190
know you're not alone i just said

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,929
earlier it's like want any people deal

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,340
with that for anxiety alone like there's

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,980
other stuff you know it's probably more

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,529
common and it removes the anxiety of

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,970
just hiding your anxiety like you know i

00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:53,240
can tell you like I'm having a panic

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,760
attack or something like that

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,230
there is anxiety about other people

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,270
knowing I'm having a panic attack right

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,310
you're like when we don't notice like to

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,360
freak me all right now they don't see be

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,800
like you know I kind of have like this

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,540
deer in headlights moment and it looks

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,360
like you know since you're what

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,940
everyone's looking at me good patients

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,040
but you know the choice is up to you to

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,020
really talk to someone about that you

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,820
know it's easy to understand if like you

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,890
go in there and play with a broken leg

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,330
will understand like a broken leg this

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,610
person can come forwards their legs

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,280
broken it's harder for some people be

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:28,040
like LOL i know i have like really bad

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,200
panic attacks right now it's a word oh i

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,510
can't see it like you know anything so

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,610
we can't really relate to it but you

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,350
know just like meddle this is an illness

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
that means it's treatable like it has

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,890
treatment methods and you go back and

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,810
like you continue to work on it and you

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,240
can still do your job when you're

00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:50,660
dealing with it so just a quick recap of

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:52,460
all kind of points 1 over and so you

00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,650
know when you actually go and fathers

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,180
you can tell when you know anxiety

00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,850
really becomes like affects your

00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,250
day-to-day life you can't get your daily

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,510
routine done like wake up in the morning

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,100
you're anxious maybe about going out

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,360
I'll do you like these excessive

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,860
thoughts it's intrusive like you just

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,710
can't you can't get about during your

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,690
day lady won't start talk to someone I'm

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,670
and the good news is it's completely

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,110
manageable and treatable you know just

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,940
like a broken leg just like having the

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,190
flute or anything like that or anything

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,350
else later therapy there's medication

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,460
you know you people do you do exercise

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,370
and something that just makes you feel

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,110
better diet breathing exercises you know

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,400
like you don't see in cartoons and

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,990
they're breeding is the brown paper bag

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,090
and I realize that's like a real thing

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,390
like you know like my therapist in high

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,620
school is it not your rpms I induced

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,060
because it's just like the balance of

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,130
like carbon dioxide and stuff like that

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,570
really like it calms you down and you

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,880
kind of actually have to practice those

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,350
when you're not having a panic attack on

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,700
the boys like you know just like you

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,020
have to practice like knowing your tools

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,760
and everything like that because like

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,830
when it comes down through you're having

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,090
a panic attack yours you go oh like

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,130
how do I do this again how do I agree

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,490
right like something that's simple that

00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,960
light just like how do I agree right now

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,520
so you know how can you help someone

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,419
who's maybe having a panic attack or has

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,100
anxiety

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:05,929
that these are kind of some things that

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:12,679
I kind of like found and kind of came up

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:14,090
with so so just listen to start

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,769
listening I'll see what they say

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,149
sometimes you know someone just wants to

00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,679
talk and like as they start talking

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,480
because you start feeling better and

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,639
like didn't just start like resolving

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,109
themselves on their own you know you

00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:26,869
just start asking them what they need

00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:29,389
like hey what can I do to help you okay

00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,999
take you somewhere I like don't say just

00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:34,100
relax oh it's you know it's like it's

00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:35,869
funny like you're about it like oh yeah

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,480
it's nice that big deal t yeah you know

00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:39,859
if I could I would let you freak it out

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,330
right now it would be like holding the

00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:44,600
spot of India we should take this or not

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:46,909
oh you know so it's like just don't be

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,440
dismissive of it because like like I

00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,179
said you can't really see it on someone

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,379
you might not know like you know you

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,909
might look them in the eyes you might

00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:54,499
really not they might be looking past

00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,730
you how you looking but it's really hard

00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:59,239
to tell like someone's really reading

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,190
out taking to a quiet place sometimes

00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,480
just like you know love spot which is

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,249
like that just make you really anxious

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,200
need to go somewhere quiet on vehicle

00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,759
loan or don't want to be around anyone

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,129
because you just don't want them to

00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,639
notice like oh can they tell us and

00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:15,289
happening right now and just avoid

00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,519
touching or grabbing like after I wrote

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:25,340
the slide I'm like ah that's probably a

00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:27,200
good goal in general but I did want to

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,749
leave it could if it is important that

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
like you know if sometimes anxiety like

00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:32,869
sometimes for me is like a physical

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,909
thing that feeling ago I dealers rear

00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:36,049
cane it's like you know you meanwhile I

00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,249
know my god I came here give me hug you

00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:39,109
don't know you know just felt the pain

00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:40,460
again like made it worse in life it's

00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:42,139
just more of you so I don't want to be

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,460
like cognizant of like that could be

00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:46,279
what they're feeling if you don't if you

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,440
don't know that person that well um I

00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:50,480
can point it out so you can mergency

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,129
medical treatment if you've never had

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,210
anxiety before and you start seeing like

00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:55,669
some of those symptoms that we talked

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,919
about like earlier they do share like a

00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:59,720
lot of real they are real symptoms of

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,299
other real serious medical emergencies

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,309
and like you know having anxiety

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,080
unfortunately sometimes means like trips

00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,759
to the ER richards a doctor that like

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,960
there's really okay you're fine and like

00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,639
that's good that makes you feel a little

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,070
better you get more understanding of

00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:14,690
like what's like you know the symptoms

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,300
that you experience and what's like

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,740
bad symptoms on my anxiety symptoms like

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,090
change like every few years likes

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,650
playing a game with me you know i said

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,090
earlier when it was like I used to have

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,860
stomach pains and then like it's witcha

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,780
like my face we get tingling what's like

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,140
the new thing and then like I don't know

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,880
where I'm at now um but yeah it could be

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,290
a real emergency so you always want to

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,490
err on the side of caution especially if

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,200
someone doesn't have a history of it

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,680
could be something that you need to seek

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,850
out so just kind of wrapping up here the

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,140
one thing I just want you all over

we're an industry that has shutter our

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,140
emotions because it's all about breaking

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:54,780
fixing and moving on to the next problem

was in college when it was actually at

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,230
its worst than that that was when I

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,190
realized those like any medication to

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,170
handle because there's just like

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,600
crippling like panic attacks every day

00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,220
you know we're like I said when it does

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,290
in fact your day-to-day can't go to

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,640
class and something that and like a lot

00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,110
of them without like any particular

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,050
reason looks like why am I so anxious

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:29,550
all the time things like that and you

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,220
know I've read like other things where

00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,960
people say like you know you you kind of

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,760
want to fix a problem before it becomes

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,870
a problem and one of those things like

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,460
you know I'm not saying a bunch of

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,040
therapy but it's like good you kind of

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,870
like start addressing things before they

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,970
could a kind of spiral a spiral epic

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,620
troll and stuff like that but yeah I

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,790
mean maybe it was different for me

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,040
because it wasn't like it went from like

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,540
I was really bad at the start it just

00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,920
kind of naturally progressed so it was

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,620
nice to have a little bit of like a

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,250
heads up that but I knew that it's

00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,250
happening son

00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:11,450
data we do those things you mentioned

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,309
that mistakes server down with why you

00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,200
have a disorder you get them yet

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:16,700
problems really I just feel like it's

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,769
good to have a plan first time it

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:24,320
happens we realized after I fix that

00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:25,639
like yeah why just even gets there yeah

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,259
and that's like normal like everyone

00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,729
feels that but not a lot of people say

00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,049
that right like they don't realize like

00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:31,549
they may see that person's make stressed

00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:33,350
out now I realize what they're actually

00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:43,669
feeling inside is like could be a lot

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:54,349
worse yes short bob so this actually HR

00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:57,859
HR yes say something fire managers

00:29:54,349 --> 00:30:00,570
problems depression and somebody

00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:06,310
mentioned it's a friend

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:09,820
very very afraid anxiety young young man

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:13,750
is one HR I think it's often very

00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:18,850
helpful because there's lots of

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:21,100
resources about workplace yeah and I

00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:24,490
would just say that well the usual

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:27,780
manager training of code HR here's a

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,780
good first reflex

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,640
I would actually say this for myself

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:45,730
don't go to HR right away they'll go

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,950
right away HR because it's kind of like

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,500
if you ever had that situation like

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,080
tripping public place all done

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,670
somebody's like shopping waiver at you

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,450
and they're calling lawyers or oregano

00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:02,170
so the overreaction to people and I've

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:06,700
had twice in my career people being told

00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:16,300
hey char serious mental health issues

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:17,530
and what happens is yet yeah it's really

00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,360
hard like I said like a lot of people

00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,190
just go I handle it it's a touchy

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,260
subject again just around helping

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,520
approach and you're going to see that

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,820
handle difficulties and larger

00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,630
corporations or smaller startups and how

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:36,040
much others want me around or anything

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:39,180
shredded a sua yeah I respect makena for

00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,560
New York City on stores and one of the

00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,360
mental health and immediately people

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,190
watch it oh well your company may have

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,380
crashed it's devastating you in the lay

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,210
people off so maybe then you should see

00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,700
a therapist about depression and it kind

00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,150
of like what no that's not really how

00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,210
depression works my serious with it has

00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,410
been again like you said it's the this

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,270
is ridiculous i am planning a

00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,420
disproportionate and your rational

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,280
reaction to and everyday thing what the

00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,970
hell yeah oh and that's when i finally

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,370
went to

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,409
the therapist now I started out in

00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:15,789
Silicon Valley San Francisco area where

00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:19,720
the technical beliefs America is common

00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:22,840
as dirt I have had trouble finding temp

00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,110
friendly psychiatrists how here in the

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,960
city soft rock has been a really good

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:34,780
resource for me but having personal

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:37,030
girls and even better and mine my moment

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,390
where I went I really seem like natural

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,380
doctor about this was when I was having

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,630
uncontrollable sleeping polls as well

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,990
driving the car went from my job they

00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:49,390
wasn't moon base your license based it

00:32:46,990 --> 00:33:06,309
was what the hell is wrong with me and

00:32:49,390 --> 00:33:08,020
that I can't even yeah now you know I go

00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:09,280
I don't want what's a month at this

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,650
point just kind of like being in

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,760
stringing and just be like all right you

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,380
know as you want sometimes you don't

00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,669
really have much to talk about but you

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,559
know you're kind of like I said want to

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,150
get ahead of things before it like it's

00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,860
that bad boy you know how to handle it

00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,030
you know I think I consider myself at

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,970
this point had things under control

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,950
pretty good you know I get a normal

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,840
anxiety like I haven't had a date on it

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,700
in a really long time I slowly carry

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,500
with carry it with me when I travel

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:37,090
that's more float the plane right which

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:39,549
is like but I guess I'll scarred my

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,760
gumption wait a minute all right go take

00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:44,409
out two more questions okay yeah I guess

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,760
my question is sort of how does this

00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:48,580
conversation kind of

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,180
sort of circles where it's been a very

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,580
open space to have these kinds of

00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,400
dialogues on today how does that kind of

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,090
like the circle this would never like

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:04,210
happening kind of like a friday beep so

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,560
like how does what is that like all

00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,020
talking about in your office you're

00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,149
there what is that is there a certain

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,560
position there yeah i mean i don't know

00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:13,750
it's really obvious that it's like some

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,860
people just want to talk about it you

00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,840
know it's just they're so uncomfortable

00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,580
talking about it like it took me a long

00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,200
time that like that coffee big story by

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,179
the way like only two people probably in

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,409
my life knew about them or just a total

00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,750
of you because it's just embarrassing

00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,550
stupid like you know my mom and I will

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:34,330
joke about every now and I just like

00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:36,100
still say I walk by the coffee yeah it's

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,950
really exactly do you kind of realize

00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,300
just how much pick table exactly yeah

00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:46,320
you just don't know so it's more

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,320
