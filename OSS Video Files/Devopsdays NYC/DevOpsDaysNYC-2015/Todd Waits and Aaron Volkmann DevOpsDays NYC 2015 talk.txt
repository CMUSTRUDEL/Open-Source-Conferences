22 John Piper has a beard that sums up

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:21,840
and both of them are from Carnegie

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:26,550
Mellon University we won't have it open

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,369
session about that later so apparently

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,189
you're supposed to karna if you're from

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,829
New York if you like having to ask like

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:47,489
how you get to Carnegie Hall you know

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:51,390
you know your history really named after

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,309
in Texas town so anyway Tom and Karen

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,899
they're going to talk about the culture

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,219
shock and I'm really forward to hearing

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,800
this presentation I think a lot of us

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,250
have gone through this version of this

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,880
and I heard that they might be popular

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,409
culture references involved now look at

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,680
something we're not on the slightly for

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,659
all right yeah but energy hey thank you

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,299
you know my name is Aaron and this is

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,310
Todd we're from a software engineer

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,830
software engineering Institute which is

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,350
an sfr bc that's on the umbrella of

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,939
creating knowledge University every time

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,799
we say Carnegie Mellon's like pee-wee's

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,210
Playhouse you're going to scream and it

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,189
will be wonderful so I do want to

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,810
apologize for this next slide you're

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,159
about to see I did not want to include

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,380
this there's a lot of stuff about this

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,570
next slide I did not want to include but

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,549
we were required to do it for legal

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,130
reasons so I'm just going to move

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,460
forward through it raised themselves

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,460
okay there we go

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,090
gonna move on you'll spend the next six

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,490
hours that's how much sex hours so give

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,289
a brief history of DevOps where it came

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,380
from from the beginning from the

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,899
beginning so in the beginning there was

00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,269
water phone and this is just a brief

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,530
over for those of you who may not

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:13,870
understand why we need to talk about

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,690
DevOps this hopefully will be brief I'm

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,239
making it too much so waterfall was

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,629
really focused on these the functional

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,390
silos of tasking and it was all very

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:27,370
sequential so you don't start you can't

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,560
do anything until all the requirements

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,579
are done you can't do and so on and so

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,430
forth it became kind of this and for

00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:38,379
some places sure it can work but for

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,069
most places it becomes kind of a human

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:44,410
centipede of sdlc so so many cause

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,819
problems um I'm taking requirements

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:51,430
today's everybody is like that so I so

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,040
to address a lot of the problems of the

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,310
waterfall we started adopting much more

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,139
agile methodologies and what this did

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,329
was allowed us to move much more rapid

00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,910
pace as development teams and brought

00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:06,430
customers closer invest we have a that

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,950
short feedback loop so we can do much

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,109
more rapid improvement cycles right so

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,910
as enterprises started starting to do

00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,489
agile within their development group but

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,400
actually half the reality was thanks jen

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,730
is humble for this water scrum fall it's

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,049
also a blessed who made it up but over

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,690
here on the left view of the business

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,209
has to do a big slow on elliptic process

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,410
they have the forecasted in a year in

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,870
advance how much money either going to

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,169
spend we have development happily being

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,329
agile releasing doing bi-weekly releases

00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:41,260
chumming hanging off thin slices of

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:44,290
transparent the functionality over to QA

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,230
and operations after then it agreed with

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,989
all the existing systems that a piece of

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,200
functionality has to operate with tested

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,190
and then finally release it so

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,739
development started you know throwing

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,829
the ball over and over again catch catch

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,930
catch that's just it work for quality

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,569
which is where we get an extension of

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,060
alcohol to envelope other areas of the

00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,010
business

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,890
and that's where that ops comes in where

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,930
everybody's unified through having

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,840
shared goals to fulfill business needs

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,000
and we achieve this through

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,220
collaboration collaboration becomes a

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,450
very key part of DevOps and that's why

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,970
we're focused on a theme that we're

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:27,440
focusing on here I'm with these teams I

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,090
we'd have a dev team we have an

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,550
Operations team will just kind of

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,910
simplify it to that and these teams have

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,930
conflicting priorities where the

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,550
developers are trying to introduce

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,560
change they're trying to introduce new

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,330
features things that are different and

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,430
the operations team is trying to

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,910
maintain service availability so

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,870
somewhat conflicting priorities

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,790
interesting note about the work

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,880
priorities is that it actually wasn't

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,010
plural for about 500 years as it existed

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,350
there was you can only have one priority

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:02,000
and what you're doing there was no such

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,250
thing as a priority for 500 years

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,470
somebody's like both I actually have two

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,760
priorities and so we added the plural

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,830
version works at the English language

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,390
wait we got a whole life reading right

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,870
yes so um so it's an instant way to look

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,330
at what what is the priority of your

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,070
team and when I say tame with the

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,440
organization and that's where we start

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,210
to get into these shared goals where

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,430
we're trying to deliver business value

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,780
to a customer we're not trying to just

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,910
introduce features for the safety

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,700
features or maintain availability for

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:38,600
the sake of availability we're our goals

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,900
across divisions is business value if we

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,910
take my business value then there's

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,139
really not really doing anything for

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:50,450
anybody so when these related these

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,450
conflicting priorities if developments

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,430
torturing operations with doing very

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,130
rapid releases that you know they can't

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,050
realistically take on you know causing

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,169
instability and service unavailability

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,840
which is you know contrary to our goals

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,820
there's gonna be animosity and conflict

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,919
between them and also you know as a

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,840
developer of operations pushes back and

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,520
says uh no

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,860
let's put the brakes on this this isn't

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,120
going to work development get stressed

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,970
out because they're the ones who

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,620
promised the dates that things are

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:25,600
available in traditionally organized

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:28,090
organizations so it helps to increase

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,979
empathy between these two groups you

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,620
know that's what we want to achieve it

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:35,770
is an interesting study was done up in

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,770
Montreal at McGill University where they

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:42,180
studied empathy and stress as it relates

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,350
to strangers to actors that are very

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,169
unfamiliar with each other what they did

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,880
was they put two people who are friends

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,639
we're very familiar with each other in a

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,139
room and measured their empathy and

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,840
their empathy was you know very high up

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:57,910
here if they put two strangers in a room

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,340
together their empathy was very low for

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,680
that other person they relate they link

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,930
this to the stress that we feel whenever

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,360
we interact with complete strangers it's

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,590
probably some evolutionary thing where

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,970
we don't know if we're going to talk to

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,460
a stranger they're gonna come punch us

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,889
in the face or something but and they

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,070
proved this by giving strangers a drug

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,950
which inhibited or later their fight or

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,080
flight response nice so those two

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,360
strangers they had the same things if

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,849
there is fun to life the proposed new

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:46,900
presentation is we have some samples of

00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:49,030
drugs you'll be awesome example no since

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,099
we can't take a drugs we need beer we

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,010
need that some fright at all somebody

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:57,669
would be pushing go ahead deploy deploy

00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:00,550
deploy it's okay maybe what they did hey

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:03,250
two strangers together make them play

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,889
rockband the video game for 15 minutes

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,130
and two complete strangers then shifted

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,860
to being having the same empathy as

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,690
friends for life so all I had to do is

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,210
play rock man for 15 minutes and they

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,659
shifted from the stranger zone over to

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,670
the friend zone so we may not rock band

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,340
may not work for all of us

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:27,760
I love it but other people don't because

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,410
i suck at it and so you have to look at

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,090
the culture of the team the people that

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,980
are that are involved and figure out

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,500
what are the best ways this involves

00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,210
believe it or not empty to understand

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,070
what is going to work best for the

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,480
people that you're working with to to

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,430
break down those barriers to provide

00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,670
shared experiences across all the team

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:50,760
members we have a colleague at SEI who

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,440
in the early 90s he was managing the

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,480
developed development team operations

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,920
team and i know it's going to shock

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,690
everybody in the early 90s because it

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,600
was such a blissful time those two teams

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,310
really butted heads we really had and so

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,840
he's started trying to figure out okay

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,640
well we'll didn't share lunch it's get

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,500
everybody out we have lunch for that

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,300
team didn't work so instead of cable to

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,890
pizza I have to work and then that

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,740
didn't work then they tried calling and

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:19,210
so yeah this was pretty rock band so I

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,090
have in three weeks so they actually had

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,680
to use a real ball so none of those

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,840
experiences for that particular team

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,240
worked and I think it's important to

00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,620
emphasize for that particular team you

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,940
may have a team of just bullying

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,890
fanatics and bullying is going to work

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,280
great to break down those barriers the

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,170
other issues that the lunches the

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,210
activities all it really happen is that

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,600
your operations people wouldn't hang out

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,160
with the operations people in you still

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,510
have all these cliques you did their

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,310
cliques are being maintained throughout

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,080
these shared experiences what end up

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,870
working for them is yes another video

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,980
game was doom deathmatch anonymous and

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,590
so playing doom across all across teams

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,390
actually created some shared experiences

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,850
they break down these barriers and stop

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,380
treating each other like strangers if

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,550
you're just starting out implementing

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,110
the office or you're finding that you're

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,940
running into some of these riddles of

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,910
animosity between teams then it's a very

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,830
least starting by knowing the names of

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,300
people that you're working with studies

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:23,350
have shown that just by knowing the

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,030
names of people has the ability to it's

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,530
not really increased communication it

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,560
makes everybody feel as if communication

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,000
is happening and it gives everybody a

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,490
greater trust in people if they're

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,250
working with just knowing the name

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,410
I'm yeah in fact so something that we

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,330
get to do it at our workplace they

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:43,920
started you know really getting into

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:46,320
sharepoint and I think our put ID badge

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,730
pictures to our outlook account so that

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,589
whenever you received an email you can

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,290
see that person's mugshot on that email

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,600
so you could start associating names

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,550
with the face it turns out that through

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,920
this process there is somebody that I

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,050
dealt with only through service desk if

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,880
it's an email and it was very

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,100
uncomfortable relationship because I was

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,080
just annoyed by that person once they

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,880
started doing the badge picture thing I

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,390
could see who that person was I realized

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,160
that hey I'm really come I see them

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,180
every day the coffee-room talk to them

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,050
and like we're cool and just by

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,580
associating that totally changed my

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,800
outlook of how it work with them in

00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,190
instead of you know blaming them and

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,709
having animosity it opened up a better

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,870
working relationship with them yeah I

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:34,800
again the folks when you're looking at

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,630
this is it is an individual activity for

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,339
your organization there isn't

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,950
necessarily a one-size-fits-all because

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:44,640
we are complex systems to quote an

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,870
earlier I talk is that we are so

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,410
different that we need a different

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:54,060
approach for each communication

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,899
transparency those are like is dance

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,680
instances of shift left if we have

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,959
transparency and we share information

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,420
and communicated to where we need it

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,220
then that's shifting it left and making

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,500
it available earlier in the process

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:11,070
those who don't know what shift left is

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,230
uh assume I we said project starts here

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,990
then we have victory over here if we

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,570
find information late in the process

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,360
closer to our victory that sets us back

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,829
but there's no reason why we did know

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,320
this information we should shift it left

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:29,520
and bring it closer to the front of the

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,940
process to increase the success of

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,100
outcomes get on that more later yeah so

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,399
let's say you know we're in that famous

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,050
last mile of a project you know we think

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,810
we're going to slide into home plate and

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,210
actually achieve success and

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,740
did something working into production

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,510
but because some piece of information

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,360
was left out because it wasn't

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:55,020
communicating properly we followed what

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,900
we call Rumble pits where we Rumble our

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,970
organ trail car get stuck in the mud we

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,920
have to fix it somebody get this in

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,890
Harry somebody always it's just lots of

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,510
rebirth Oh lots a lots of setbacks and

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,520
then we have to go back again and

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,320
everybody grumbles about it so in order

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,360
to serve a way to circumvent these

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,040
grumble pins is by making sure that we

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,740
have enough communication and

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,680
transparency to make that information

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,230
available sooner a way that we do this

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,200
in DevOps is through total integration

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:31,500
automation integrating our source

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,540
control with our issue tracker with our

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,450
continuous integration through all this

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,730
automation we have we can put systems in

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:42,510
place the pipeline's data to the actors

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,220
who need it the making sure that we have

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,510
these single sources of truth is

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,730
critical when you're dealing with

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,440
communication and transparency for

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,300
example we have requirements document

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,339
great our developers take it they put it

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,630
into issue trackers and then we may have

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,280
a client that we're working that has

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,410
their own copy of the requirements

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,750
document it if any of the things start

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,550
to get updated without the other one

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,400
getting updated we're introducing

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,320
significant amounts of risk and that's

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,940
that's what we want to get away from so

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,280
the idea is to then bring it back into

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,089
the single source of truth of what what

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,920
content is king and one example this

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,470
where we had we had again with

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,550
requirements documents is several years

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,260
ago I was tasked with having to find the

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,760
latest version correct version of

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,170
requirements document which meant I was

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,670
digging through emails I'm digging

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,959
through trying to figure out I was it on

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,070
sharepoint oh no they didn't upload that

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,020
version the sheriff one so it's actually

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,720
on that person supply you know it's a

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,100
terrible process if anybody ever has to

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,839
deal with documentation which I actually

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,040
really love it so if you want to have

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,350
documentation let's check and so one of

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,420
the things that I end up doing was

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,980
working with the team we centralized all

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,990
of our documentation into our source

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,000
control so we could

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,570
treated the same way that we treat our

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,730
code so it's plain text we we have it

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,200
have an automated build since we have a

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,510
build configuration our build server

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,730
that actually builds or documentation

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,620
into the artifacts that are used and

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,660
then disseminated so it generates an

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,850
HTML generates a PDF it generates a word

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,170
document that can then be given to the

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,209
people that need it but as far as we are

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,459
concerned the single source of truth for

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,410
our documentation is what's checked in a

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,300
because is checked in and in our build

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,880
server we can also start to then attach

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,730
builds of our documentation to builds of

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,020
our our applications so then it really

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,300
helps when we're trying to go back and

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,980
virgin things anyway that's a that's a

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,680
different I mean a little too deep into

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,540
that so um the ideas again looking for

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,010
the single sources of truth and another

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,600
instance of this and it goes along with

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,070
the dueling ragin automation points we

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,680
have on the slide but you know for

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,779
structure is code that's a communication

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,160
its community ops I'll being communicate

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,230
with them you know what production is

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,930
going to blow fly containers help with

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,480
this you know chef puppet all those

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,990
tools through your infrastructure as

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,089
code you know it is what it is and we

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,339
can pet we can trust what we're testing

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:05,060
anything we conversion then we can start

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:07,579
to test and diff and it really helps our

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,760
next aspect is creating a new plane

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,770
culture now we all know that mistakes do

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,779
happen they're going to happen the S

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,000
word is going to hit the fan eventually

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,589
whatever this happens we must leave a

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,250
motion out if you don't have a time or

00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:24,260
the energy for it so laborious takes

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,000
happen yo everybody just focuses on

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,970
fixing the problem making sure that it

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,250
doesn't happen again a new blade culture

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,130
is a culture where people aren't afraid

00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,680
to take risks in order to you know

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:43,610
further the craft and push the envelope

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:46,490
Ombuds possible to innovate so the blame

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,920
culture having a culture of blame really

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,779
and I'm sure we all have stories where

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,640
we've worked in a blame culture and

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:53,070
sometimes when we're in a good culture

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,600
and still

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:59,100
look back into that blame thing it's

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,990
kind of a visceral reaction to problems

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,790
but when we can shoot that into a

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,160
culture of accountability we're rather

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,459
than looking for who caused the problem

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,190
we actually empower our team members to

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,020
be accountable to be responsible for for

00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,610
the the things that they're doing for

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,520
the things they're pushing out that

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,709
accountability can I can have people's

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,000
really step up to the plate in ways you

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:29,040
would not expect to have happen is held

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,870
so how do we start a culture of

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,530
accountability or how does it stay on

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:37,160
exactly yes so I think what really can

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,510
start having is again will you have to

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,220
have accountability there needs to be

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,740
the communication transparency you have

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,150
to have to share the shared goal make

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,580
sure that you have this common vision

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,650
and that that does not help that does it

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,570
happen by Fiat it doesn't happen by

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,910
force where you go in and you say hey I

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,170
wrote a memo here's the email we are all

00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,570
focused on this that ever he goes and

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,550
you think every just ignores it right it

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,200
goes again to the shared experiences

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,830
whether the shared experiences are as

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,070
silly as playing rock band or as I it

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,990
critical as making something work that's

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,670
broken if something's worked if

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,380
something's broken getting the op ops

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,270
team in the development team to be

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,930
working together to fix that problem and

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,340
not the hey here's the problem and you

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,870
said no you're the problem then I say no

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,280
you're the problem that back and forth

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:32,610
of blame starts to erode and it will

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,980
kill the trust and so it's using these

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,310
opportunities to the opportunities of

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,810
these pain to build these shared

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,480
experiences that can draw people

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,800
together also everyone listen to slide

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,350
where she showed her teeing you

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,820
everybody standing together does he ran

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,110
off so your blinds are blurred and the

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,030
walls are lowered so then you have

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,100
everybody's part of a team and nobody

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:57,150
has you have one specific job the job is

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,920
to unite for the business goals in you

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,130
know yeah knowing that I found myself

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,310
having to work on on code for Baker

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,090
boxes and docker containers that I'm not

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,190
I'm not

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,140
operations person but I can't start now

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,970
to troubleshoot some of those issues in

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,909
ways that I couldn't before when we're

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,309
just dealing with bare metal it I found

00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:19,409
that that system was much more intuitive

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,840
to me and so it allows me now to work

00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,730
with we are deploying things I can work

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,330
much more closely with my operations

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:31,860
group to get that done um I'm going to

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:37,260
have to move on down okay so I that's

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:39,390
yeah so um the people closer to the work

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,850
this is another critical one is as a

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,320
manager we want to we want to take the

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,240
lead from the people closest this goes

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,980
back to word table talking about where

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,309
we can't force people to adopt the

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,020
principles but we have to listen to the

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,490
team listen to the people who closer to

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,990
work about what improvements can be made

00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,399
that the documentation example is

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,250
another good example is that didn't come

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,299
from a manager saying wow we really have

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,610
a lot of problems with this

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:07,559
documentation if that was me saying I am

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,470
sick and tired I have to find one more

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:14,190
word document I gonna make an empty

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:16,200
threat but but what I did is instead i

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,059
worked with team members to figure out

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,740
what is the solution how can we

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,210
implement this and we did a whole bunch

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,559
of iterations until we found something

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,809
it worked for us and then I said to

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,020
management hey we did this and we're

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,620
going to use this and so are you so um

00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:34,230
it and they actually accepted it I mean

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:36,210
that that's nice and so so it's

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,610
important to listen to those people and

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,789
I think the management roles thicker

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,250
yeah so man whose role at all this is to

00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:47,010
you nurture an environment where people

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,020
are comfortable to you send off their

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:52,409
thoughts their observations and empower

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,059
them an example of this is so yeah this

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:57,090
is story what a chair as well so in the

00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:59,399
medical field which has so much overlap

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,799
with development in operations and the

00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:04,529
50s nurses started to that's when I

00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,270
started to take the the vital signs of

00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,289
patients every six hours and I got what

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,110
your pulse which you're going to put

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,940
your pain level things like that and

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,350
they started doing that not at the best

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,879
of the doctors because the doctors

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,889
didn't care didn't the hospital's did

00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:20,139
the nurses care the nurses were the

00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:21,489
closest ones to the patient and they

00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:23,559
found that if they track these

00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,599
measurements that they could actually

00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,329
identify when problems we're going to

00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,099
happen with that person and so this is a

00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:33,099
change that came from the people closest

00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:34,809
to the work and now its standard

00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:36,940
practice if anybody's ever been in a

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:38,529
hospital I guarantee you at two in the

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,329
morning when you're trying to hit that

00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,629
morphine thing in the nurse subject

00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:47,079
what's your pain level you know anyway

00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:51,699
that's a lot another open space about

00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:53,259
that so I think it's a poor thing it's

00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:55,329
like two doctors back then it was

00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,190
obvious yeah poor you're not very

00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:59,109
important to make this checklist making

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,879
a formalized process where we check

00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,979
these things and document they weren't

00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:04,629
very close so you know it seemed like

00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:06,879
such a simple thing that they did for my

00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:09,309
eyes that process but you know as the

00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:12,069
people down with boots on the ground we

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:16,629
were able to you know find that process

00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:19,299
improvement its leadership role to pick

00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:22,690
out the new blade culture and empower

00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:24,279
people to even do this I think another

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,489
point that was made i'm going to crib

00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:30,459
off that previews chuckle hi I'm was the

00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:32,499
credit aspect we working with one

00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:35,709
customer actually and we had a

00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:39,190
particular user in that customer who was

00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:41,229
super helpful she she gave us so much

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,819
good feedback and but good feedback i

00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:45,039
don't mean positive feedback i mean she

00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:47,709
told us everything that went wrong with

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,599
detailed log reports and i was doing

00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:51,940
this and then this happened i'm like wow

00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,729
this is these people need to know they

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,499
need to know what they have and so that

00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:58,449
was a thing that i did is this is a

00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,429
person who's not even in my team but i'm

00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:02,769
going to give her the credit what she

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:04,209
did and I talked to her managers in her

00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,969
superiors and let them know that hey

00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:08,559
this person that you have over here

00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:10,059
deserves something like you need to

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,219
recognize an effort that she's putting

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:15,190
it she's going above and beyond right so

00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:18,239
that'll just encourage people to report

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,589
those things up and behave in those ways

00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:22,440
we already talked about should love we

00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:24,819
have a whole slide dedicated to it

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,279
Security's a big aspect i've seen it

00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:28,519
security is an afterthought or see a

00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,279
sort of sloth on that the

00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,489
and kind of like a mcgriddle syrup

00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,729
sometimes best inside the pancake

00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:40,609
instead of like slap on at the security

00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:42,830
even more horn yeah um always it gets

00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:44,899
messy different types offering yes i

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,839
think that the Dalton nights in with

00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:49,879
Erin see because they security the hard

00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,379
work that becomes a hard look for people

00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:56,239
to overcome and because and for two

00:23:54,379 --> 00:24:00,139
reasons one is that it's like widgets

00:23:56,239 --> 00:24:03,259
option and it's transparent like don't

00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:05,209
them to understand the takeaway de

00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:07,399
structure of the environments yeah so

00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:09,139
just a sort of hit on that you know i'm

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,639
a developer and developers work very

00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:13,190
closely with the business towards the

00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:15,259
front of our project developments focus

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,609
is on assuming the business functional

00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:18,950
requirements things they asked for

00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:21,109
things that they can see so what this

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,979
shift left you know concept is all about

00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:26,119
is changing the culture to where the

00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:28,219
non-functional requirements the things

00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,049
that are needed to successfully run

00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:32,899
something in production or thought about

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:35,269
and you're promoted earlier you know

00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:37,129
because of her nap develop its natural

00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:38,899
inclination to want to delight the

00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:46,029
customer things that they can touch and

00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:48,589
see and say hip hip hooray bow okay so

00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:51,679
much shift left operational testing

00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:53,959
stuff like blood testing failover how do

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,639
we blog disaster recovery these things

00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,320
have to be thought of you know back to

00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:00,919
the delta development stage not just

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,289
after user acceptance testing and i

00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:07,969
think i'm going to kind of just sum up

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:09,529
my feelings here I is that the DevOps we

00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:11,209
talk a lot about the relationships

00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,579
between the developers in the operations

00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:15,589
team really develop DevOps becomes a

00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:18,079
philosophy that should permeate every

00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:19,759
aspect of the organization for example

00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,070
our presentation we were going to give

00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,169
every slide in here was an episode from

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,959
full house and then we passed it through

00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:29,029
legal and they said I'm sorry to cannot

00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,619
use any images of full house cuz we

00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:32,239
don't want to get sued they look good

00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:34,879
perfect analogy because you have the

00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:37,080
Olsen twins in a cluster so with the

00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:39,300
Michelle service they say

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,980
we always have a backup on standby so we

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,040
keep the Mary Kate term is there so

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:46,680
let's yeah perfect and we can use it so

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,390
is a culture that permeates everything

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,200
everything is shipped left whether it's

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:54,450
legal departments whether it's marketing

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,700
business operations security all needs

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,300
to be a part of the project and thought

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:03,030
of with all of these things in mind

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:05,700
right panda typing my most important

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,860
aspect to me to take away is to foster a

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,950
culture where people aren't afraid of

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,480
papers I've been a lot of places where

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,700
even though day-to-day lives were

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,150
horrible and people were pretty much

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,460
tortured by aren't all being crazy all

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,770
the time nobody was willing to stick

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,020
their neck out and try to do things in a

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:28,560
different better way because of a blank

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:31,230
altos in place absolutely and if we have

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:44,310
time for questions all right couple

00:26:31,230 --> 00:27:02,790
questions we got to end the class we're

00:26:44,310 --> 00:27:04,980
not very a lot of things that you're

00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,170
mentioning able of sense but they make

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:11,340
sense in a situation to which there's

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:14,100
not a lot of financial requirements them

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,630
so how do you kind of introduce some of

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,789
these like methodologies that you talk

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:21,659
about the people who also have to answer

00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:23,129
great chance eventually oh you know

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,989
that's a very very common question the

00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:27,720
question was you know in a prop you know

00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:29,549
trying to do a transformation your costs

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,019
money and there's enough right overhead

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,460
and upfront costs to making that happen

00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:38,100
what I've seen a lot of times is you

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,989
have to gather data and to prove that

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,759
you know this stuff works it really does

00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:45,919
there's a lot of research out there now

00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,909
is you know doing these things more more

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,769
organizations are doing these things and

00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:51,059
if they read the literature there's

00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,460
research publish that this stuff just

00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,349
works but uh you know maybe collect

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,379
around is that all small and may be

00:27:55,349 --> 00:28:00,389
really easy low hanging fruit metrics to

00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:01,889
demonstrate an improvement it was what

00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:04,519
it takes to convince leadership to make

00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,519
the investment

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,780
right right yeah being able to capture

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,550
that prefix time and then link it back

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,930
with the project that caused all that

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,840
for a fixed time I think is the

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:29,180
challenge to totally measuring the to a

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:34,970
possible internship of a particular

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:37,990
service anything else well thank you

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,990
