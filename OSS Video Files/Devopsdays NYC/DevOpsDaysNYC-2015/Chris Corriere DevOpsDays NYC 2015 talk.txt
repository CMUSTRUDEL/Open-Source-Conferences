right so on our talk now Miss by Chris

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:12,090
Corriere give he preset CA Corriere

00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:15,599
Twitter and human rights economy is

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,619
going to be seek to you about adultery

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,090
masses that's correct would you forgot

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,779
you've got a lot already all right

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,260
everyone Chris we go the single it is on

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,260
okay

00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:36,050
so I liked John this off this morning

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,090
where Jones at the whole staying-in your

00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,010
safety zone and then getting the spot

00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,530
where you're learning and then

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,540
proceeding out to dangers of them I

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,090
think I might be on that line here

00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,100
between learning in danger zone real

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:54,140
thin line between bravery and stupidity

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,949
ray I'm not afraid to look stupid lots

00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:02,140
engineer so I am here for selfish

00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:04,520
reasons today I got two little kids and

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,590
we homeschool them and the best bet for

00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,539
them in the future in my opinion is

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,060
learn how to get into tech it's just

00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:13,940
good plan betray go to your rock star

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,280
movie movie star do too but if you're

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,770
coming Python in the meantime I'll sleep

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,119
better tonight so I needed you know the

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,910
research part I talked about yesterday

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,880
that's really important so I've been

00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,340
doing cookie ops them where they wanted

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,030
to do a bake sale who did a bake sale or

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,799
eliminating this kid few people so you

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,420
go out there you sit in the heat it's

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,860
kind of terrible you don't make any

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,060
money and the lesson you learned is I

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,939
should have stayed inside and played

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,950
xbox or something so I didn't want them

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,229
to have that experience so I've gotten

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,290
into this habit some conferences i put

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,299
out a survey I asked questions so i can

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,630
do research from a big data Mart I like

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,939
data and we mean the kids bake cookies

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,140
and mail them to people if they answer

00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,900
our survey leave us measure

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,130
good so we've shipped like over a

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,950
hundred cookies to four different

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,780
countries in a bunch of different states

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,670
we've had pretty good success with it so

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,100
I want to alter comp in atlanta this

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,680
year which is about diversity inclusion

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,840
and i wanted to put a survey out there

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:25,260
it's like how do i do this not die right

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:30,620
um loaded questions so what I did is I

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:33,390
went through these which let's see

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,580
groups or communities you identify with

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,350
are you comfortable with sharing or

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,290
thinking about those groups with others

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,880
and then I got the cookie questions we

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,230
should be the cookies you want to

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,840
release a try so Who am I Who am i

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,519
comfortable representing I'm comfortable

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,290
representing DevOps I'm really

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,900
passionate about this stuff I consider

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,830
it a privilege to be up here thing I

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,140
can't remove for myself is I'm sis white

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,260
male I learned to assessment that altar

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,269
com few minutes this means that's pretty

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,790
good so that means my gender identity

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,450
and my sexual preferences lying together

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,640
um but I learned stuff right is that

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,070
right that I get there a Sudanese of

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,590
your gender identity how you feel

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,420
matches the biology we perform matches

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,870
the biology of Norman let's see this is

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,269
that danger zone thing so we all have

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,820
male and female energy hit us like you

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,240
have chemistry in your body both places

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,790
so I'm not talking about that

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:41,880
or because it's dangerous what I decided

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:45,200
to do instead is sorry I've got screen

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,200
problems but once I did

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,950
over here

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,560
two seconds for it

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,980
I can't see my mouth

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,750
alright

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:23,800
in review so DevOps for the masses

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:28,750
instead of talking about people i

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:32,110
decided to talk about not people so I'm

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,229
angry Schafer that velocity last year I

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,620
think and I'm a big game theory nerd and

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:40,569
he's into some game 3 stuff I'm also

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,159
more an extrovert a lot of people in

00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:44,050
this community have come to find out by

00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:48,610
completely deep talents lie low Randy

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,460
Spronk III goes awesome love it and what

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,439
ended up happening is a pset you know

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,699
this is a talk from tim i watched a few

00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,469
times you should check it out if you

00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,569
haven't seen it he talks about Nash

00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:01,060
equilibrium it talks about creative

00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,099
efficiency so jumping into the Nash

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,259
equilibrium stuff today because i did go

00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:09,610
read exam so but to think i've come to

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,139
realize that's at all of you in

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,110
competition there only a little bit

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,259
different and if you look at the bottom

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:22,779
there i got a couple truth tables um

00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:25,180
that's like an or and once you've got

00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,490
one always true when always false but if

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,879
we invert the logic it's a bit off like

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,699
literally is a bit off their constant

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,349
their homogeneous a potent drink so

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:41,650
there's a Nash equilibrium there where

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,839
how do we get from all falls to all true

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,900
you know we always talk about the ideal

00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,759
situation of everybody getting along but

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,289
if you look at the prisoner's dilemma

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,689
which is a classic example of this

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,639
problem it's kind of a rock and a hard

00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:56,650
place it's do you want to go to jail for

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,689
one year you when they're going to jail

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,360
over three years your do you want to

00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,789
throw your buddy under the bus and get

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,430
away clean which I don't like those

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,900
option

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,400
are terrible options there's not really

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,480
a good usual inference is there so I

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,990
don't think the point of the Nash

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:21,890
equilibrium wants to encourage us to

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:23,710
what's the word they put defect so why

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,050
are we changing your strategy here is

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:29,120
pretty much the argument um no honor

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,770
among thieves I'm going to assume you're

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
going to throw me under the bus even if

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,410
we agree that we're not going to snitch

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,050
each other out great but as you're right

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,880
so I'm dating the DevOps this is another

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,550
top John gave you should watch this one

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,120
too if you have it i watch this a few

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,060
times John talks about Darwin a little

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,520
bit in this I'm big into nature I like

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:57,410
the outdoors so um I tend to be more of

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,500
a Darwinist and I try to look at nature

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,990
as an assembly line so take away bending

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,390
did and stuff after that and kind of

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:10,700
flip it around and look at major three

00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:13,640
kinds of bat wings so diversity ends up

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,650
helping everywhere um this is one of

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,510
those loaded words like integrity that

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,650
you can have artistic integrity to have

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,880
financial integrity personal integrity

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,160
depending on the context it means very

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,480
different things diversity is the same

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,820
way you want to diversify your

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,630
investments you mimic mitigate risk that

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:35,570
way right you want to diverse it

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:38,630
diversified when you eat who's heard eat

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,610
all the colors of the rainbow if you get

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,080
sick and you're like I'm part of all

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,950
right meet all the time it's probably

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,020
why you don't feel so

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,700
I I try to eat more vegetables to any

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,900
different colors it's a real easy rule

00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,880
to improve your health so that's a very

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,710
colorful basket they're not a ton of

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,780
stuff in there but that's probably a

00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:01,490
pretty healthy Middleton come out of

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,830
that I think so here's where those sort

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,420
of collided you got the tulip bubble

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,120
that happened in Amsterdam really long

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,120
time ago where a single bulb was worth

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,480
more than a house for a while and it

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,490
peaked in it crashed that is effectively

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,660
a monoculture from their financial

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,280
industry right there with no

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,500
diversification and when that bubble

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,970
pops was kind of goes town for a while

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:29,930
things got bad so here's where I've got

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,630
better opportunities through

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,760
diversification so instead of bad and

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,190
worse we've got a neutral case here and

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,500
we've got a good good stuff can happen I

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,450
like it when good things happen so we

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,830
really wanted I've got like a light

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,240
green there if we're kind of good and

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,340
then like the darker green is really

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,000
good so we're going to go through and

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,950
Philip less painful so again nature

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,160
aboard the monoculture this is what

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,720
happened with the Irish potato famine

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,340
they had one time two potato that grew

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,330
really well it wasn't a lot of work

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,190
variable clone it this flight came along

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,700
that targeted a potato and wipe them all

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,070
out other cultures where potatoes are

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,410
common there are some in South America

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,060
they grow a lot of different colors and

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,760
potatoes not only does this give you

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,860
better more well-rounded nutrition but

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,520
if a nasty bug comes along that wants to

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,040
attack all your crops not everything

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,950
nice so maybe you got this other potato

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,310
that isn't the easiest to maintaining

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,720
bro but if something wipes out all your

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,040
other crops you're going to be glad

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,630
we've had some of that pie Nick if you

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,300
still have something to you mitigate

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:41,870
risk through diversification so

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,970
competition is the bad bad case nature

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,950
anytime we compete but people get hurt

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,530
some it creates a certain degree of

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,260
diversity you've got this revival of the

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,780
fittest idea but nature takes a very

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,580
diversified view of that um it's not

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,960
looking for the single best thing that

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,120
likes to keep more than one horse and

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,400
race because if you only got the one

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,040
best horse and it trips and falls into a

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,780
pit or something nothing survives make

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,990
sure once something to survive everyone

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,600
so we compete for food habitat a chance

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,710
to procreate as a strong thing in the

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,150
animal kingdom you see this a lot so if

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,040
you find yourself in a competitive

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:29,490
situation try not to be but about it

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,800
really I I tend to I've learned to

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,170
deflect better and absorb better and

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,420
listen even when people come at be

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,520
strong and are loud using foul language

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,100
whatever it's like they're upset about

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,870
something there's probably a way we can

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,070
cooperate but I got to get creative

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:49,380
about this so if you're butting heads

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,470
try to adapt this is a pitcher pump

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,500
right so you've got in places that have

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,240
very strong ecological diversity of the

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,330
nutrients in the soil and the sunlight

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,120
from above can't sustain hauled it so

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,940
instead of dying this plant adapted to

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,059
trap insects and eat them right so it

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,129
changed what it was given

00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:12,009
and moved into some form of

00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:13,449
specialization I've done this and a few

00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,099
jobs or it's like a there's all this

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,169
stuff i know i can help you a lot with

00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:18,819
it and it's that's kind of my thing that

00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:21,729
I was doing and I'm kind of defensive

00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:23,679
about it and you can kind of roll off of

00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:27,399
it and find a gap that's not filled a

00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:30,039
group that is more cooperative there's

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,749
an opportunity somewhere you're giggling

00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:37,419
all the hormones so there's a lot of

00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:41,139
competition in particularly ecological

00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:44,439
diverse places even along pitcher plants

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:48,819
so this one's a little different than

00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:55,079
the others keep adapting until you find

00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:55,079
the safety mistake so let's see here

00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,950
yeah this one has adapted to turn into

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,130
issue toilet so what's going on here

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:07,250
he's like trying to catch catch bugs

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,230
that link that's in front dude you

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,360
usually have sent on them to attract the

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,550
bugs in this particular pitcher fly

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,650
instead started develop like a sweet

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,810
nectar on it so that true comes along

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,300
stains on this picture client just goes

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,850
to talent on that nectar leaf eaten all

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,220
the juice off and like most rodents it

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,900
kind of poops all the time and fines are

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,750
nitrogen base then it is kind of gross

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,120
um but this is how this point adapt and

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,190
survive is if found at home and found

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,000
someone who can cooperate with an

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:41,300
environment that was sustainable there's

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,200
e main competition among these types of

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,390
pitcher plants so this one turned into

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,800
something that can house it back so the

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,080
bats go in there during the day and

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,820
sleep and it's kind of the same drill it

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,500
collects everything the backdrops and

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,210
that's what it sustains off of the bat

00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,280
has a nice cozy place to hang out the

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:06,800
middle of the jungle so we adapt out a

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:09,170
competition into what exactly so the

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,390
mentalism is some things of a mensa

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,360
listing i think i'm saying that right so

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:18,920
everybody knows another way to say that

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:22,160
no i think that's right thank you i'm

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,710
not a biology expert this is relatively

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,840
new stuff to me too so live in the movie

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:30,620
you may not realize you're squashing one

00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,600
so I was kind of jittery yesterday I

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,460
dropped a couple guys that's a good

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,550
example of that some people take very

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,470
strong offense is excluding a lot of the

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,120
room it's not intentional it's something

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,950
I'm working on still so I apologize that

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,660
fitted

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,190
buddy but you got to be aware of your

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,800
surroundings you have to know what's

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,600
going on and you're talking to and moves

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,060
around you you don't want to squash any

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,240
one on accident and this can happen the

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,270
guys to guys are more sensitive than

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,610
they're given credit for the slightest

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,620
of n considerations at the harder than

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,870
you would think john talking about

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,130
getting the finger in car in traffic in

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,260
the mornings kind of good example of

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,810
that where we tend to overreact

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:18,100
sometimes I guess be a simplistic

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:23,410
explanation of it so if we go from bad

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,930
bad to neutral and then we go from bad

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,300
to good something that's trying to

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,400
operate a beneficial fashion but you

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,190
don't have completely good actors in the

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,410
system there's an opportunity for become

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:40,390
parasitic right so important we do move

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,040
in and out of these spaces too and this

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,170
is a good example of that that these

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,570
aren't static game states they change

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,350
and actors move in and out of them so

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,240
for more moss or buttons um that's at

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,000
the back of the plane and they open up

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,830
at night in the moss pollinator and this

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,080
is what the what the pipe does outside

00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,060
of feeding them you could ask any

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,860
tobacco playing opposite alike horrible

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,510
bosses but they don't lay eggs and the

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,790
caterpillar attached and they feed off

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:13,330
the leaves which are the most part is ok

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,150
but sometimes they get greedy and that

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,670
cooperation becomes parasitic point so

00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,070
we've been talking I hadn't heard law

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,940
two feet before today that's one of the

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,890
things I've gotten out of this

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,330
conference which I agree with I've heard

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,160
a lot of people in the community say

00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,690
well I can't just up and leave I'm

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,270
planted in the ground right

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,280
what happens if I'm being fed off of

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:37,240
parasitic lee and i'm stuck there what

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,770
do i do you can still adapt so what the

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,840
tobacco plan will do is that will start

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,100
blooming burning today instead if it

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,350
starts getting overcome with these

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,110
little rooms and attracts hummingbirds

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,350
instead of loss so again you got to be

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,460
creative you gotta look for opportunity

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,840
the plants are figuring this out they're

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,900
right they've been around longer than

00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:00,480
ice that it's not as present so even if

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:04,780
you can move you can change be creative

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,810
so our light green squares are going to

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,670
come into commensalism um I'm pretty

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,130
sure that translates as being at the

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,440
same table so if you think into animals

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,450
at the same watering hole the gazelle a

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,160
zebra they're not bothering each other

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,470
they're not helping each other there

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,360
it's kind of arbitrary that they're both

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:28,240
there this isn't our ideal game stagette

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,490
but this is the first 1i like we're not

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,110
competitive we're not squashing anybody

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,720
we're not feeding off anybody we're

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,360
piece of lead existing so that's sort of

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,720
bare minimum situation you should be

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,180
trying to find go and with the diversity

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,590
respects you you're moving into this

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,660
thing where you want to celebrate other

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,540
people sometimes they're not

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,270
particularly comfortable as a

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,150
representative of their culture um so

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,710
there's there's room to move in and out

00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,470
of these and you have to be apologetic

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:02,200
if you do step on someone's toes being

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,120
the extra mer I've gotten better than a

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,100
nonverbal cues and going when I freak

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,680
somebody else it is really big a trimmer

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,120
and I mean I'm quick to apologize for

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,740
that and you can space when I realize I

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,740
do it again something I'm working

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,990
so you'd be trying to get commensal and

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:22,370
you think it might be a predator invite

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,439
someone to the table and give them

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,240
something to eat these little fish is so

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,700
around with a shark not bothering

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,370
anybody you don't really care about them

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,779
I'm kind of an optimist so I'd like to

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,120
think that sometimes the sharp kill

00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:39,890
something this is go ahead guys good

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,820
idea all China Sea content so try this I

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,779
do this a lot even with newer

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,360
technologists on the team new hires

00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:49,399
reach out to them try to see if there's

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,260
something you can learn from them what

00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,639
do they have a lot of experience with is

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,889
there anything you know you can help

00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,929
them with and some you know back to the

00:17:54,889 --> 00:18:00,559
just listen sometimes just let them talk

00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:02,210
but try to bring them in and keep them

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,169
inclusive give them something to feed

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,870
off of it that's a no harm be applied

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:11,000
dinner guests too sometimes I brought

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,700
people in like this and they go kind of

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,610
up wild and it's like a man this is

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:21,440
going to be harder than I thought um so

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:24,980
I take that in stride it will happen on

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,809
occasion but be aware of besides of that

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,630
that is someone's trying to extend an

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:35,630
invitation you don't want to overstep

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:38,000
that invite right so our ideal saves are

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,510
very symbiotic right so this is my

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,460
favorite one where we're both benefiting

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,409
from our relationship we're not just go

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,320
existing but there's a direct game for

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,480
most cooperating together and this is in

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,029
my opinion ideal state of a Nash

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,820
equilibrium this is where we've got into

00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,649
otology isn't the positive and there's

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,820
nothing to be gained from changing our

00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,820
gang stay at that point grey

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,800
so picture planes tall an 82 um it looks

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,080
like that bug is getting eaten right um

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,210
this is my favorite one this one really

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,850
blew my mind so it's technically an

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,410
orchid um does anybody look in the

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,100
diversity of orchids and all the cool

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,140
stuff you to try to procreate um there's

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:27,560
a lot of good stuff out there this is my

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,560
favorite example so this is an assembly

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:35,870
line where it's not eating that be this

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:38,240
is an orchid be that he's getting in

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,040
there to get the scent on him to attract

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,990
female orchid piece that's what attracts

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,850
him to the plant but the plant gives him

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,250
one way out when he gets through that

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:49,580
gap you get stuck into a quality

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,980
assurance that right so it's going to

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,810
hold on to this be until I lose these

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,510
two will Pauline nodules onto its back

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:59,210
and this is this one chance to get

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,920
itself out into the world again so hold

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,570
it there like an hour before it loosens

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,440
a grip ditch Griff to finally lets it go

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,990
and you can see him kind of crawling out

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:14,480
there and that's in the flying away with

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:16,310
the pelota great so this is where they

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,500
had an opportunity to kill me that bug

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,030
and it decided not to decided how can we

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,330
work together and cooperate which i

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:26,520
think is brilliant

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:28,140
I've been all morning but so the last

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,210
thing I want to talk about was fortitude

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,020
and perseverance there's actually two

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:37,440
pepper moths on here thinking like gray

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,210
there that's a better off maybe on same

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,400
things I don't know but he's well

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,940
camouflage what happened during the

00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:49,220
industrial revolution all these white

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:53,760
trees got covered in ash and turn black

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,500
mice do this too so there's variation in

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,140
color at them they're in a position

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,010
where they change it all right that's a

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,290
damning thing that's a door one thing so

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,810
when those trees got covered in ash all

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,750
of a sudden the light off stuck out the

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:13,170
black models for locating flush

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:15,990
completely flip the script on so if you

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,150
can adapt and stay strong throw your to

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,510
play in this world may not be clear um

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,800
which I know is a big ask but you never

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,560
know how things are going to work out

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,290
you might be that one potato that save

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,810
everybody from the fact right so stay

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,070
strong I'm here to help if I can if you

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,540
need someone to talk to there's

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:39,050
something specific I can do for you

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:39,050
please reach out to me I'm Chris Berg

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:55,520
we at a time or push one question

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:57,470
anybody yeah because you mentioned your

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,360
kids at the beginning i'm interested in

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,450
knowing what they thought of all of the

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,730
moths and bugs and plants that he plugs

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,650
and everything else they love they'd

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,210
much rather play with this all day and

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,190
do any programming i can tell you that

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,960
so that goes back to that fortitude and

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,390
perseverance things like we'll get the

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,830
fun animal stuff we go to the zoo day

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,060
the Atlanta zoo a lot we got a

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,250
membership there they have the zoo

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,710
school thing so we do a lot of fun

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,270
animal stuff too I don't chain them down

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,010
and make their program all the time but

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,990
I think try to encourage it as much time

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,100
as we can sounds like you're giving them

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:34,510
good stem direction anyway then I try

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,510
any other questions comments

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:40,420
well and by all means I'll be around for

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,490
the rest of the day a bit tomorrow too

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,260
so sync up with me if you got something

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,980
more personal and I appreciate being

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,980
