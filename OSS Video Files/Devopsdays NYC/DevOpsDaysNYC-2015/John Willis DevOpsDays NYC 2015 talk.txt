	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,059
our first speaker is John Willis I

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:10,590
should elude mouth with her and guess it

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,070
was a couple months ago in March

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,699
John had written an article around a

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,400
topic that I and I think most of us

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,680
hopefully haven't please don't read it

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,970
but we run out of the industry on how

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,010
the idea that we as a culture we as a

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,520
tribe should be working ourselves to

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:37,110
death and it's important to recognize

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,440
that this is a large problem and John

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,840
being here he's going to be able to drop

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,890
some knowledge and be able to walk us

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,710
through your hopefully some of these

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,960
things right John yeah for those who

and what I've learned over time as a

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,040

most devops terrified and that actually

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,329

easy nom Carol juice at sue I believe in

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,140
plain English burnout is killing us

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,649

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,740
actually I actually found out what this

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,590
word from a good friend of mine Steven

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,390
Nelson Smith Lord cope I'm one of the

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,970
original dev ops folks that there was

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,140
about 30-40 less that rig Anton and

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,740
about two years ago he was given a

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,170
presentation it had at that was Tel Aviv

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,150
and even it was kind of loosely like

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,700
we're working too hard and I was like

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,750
yeah blah blah blah and about ten

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,460
minutes into it

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,410
he said yeah last year was a tough year

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,200
I really thought about committing

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,940
suicide my heart freakin dropped they

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,650
know homeroom was like you know because

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,390
she got to know Stephen I mean he's like

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,520
written test driven development for chef

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,190
I mean it's just he's an awesome person

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,620
and I went up toach toach you know

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,870
please like if you're ever gonna have

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,750
those cards call me didn't think about

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,370
it for a while but then this blogger

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,370
article made me rethink about it so this

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,750
is a term that the Japanese the the the

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,220
Japanese culture is if you remember the

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,080
fact if you understand like leave and

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,150
even Deming leaned and you think about

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,300
going into the fifties sixties seventies

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:34,410
eighties their passion for defects got

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,480
so crazy that like this stuff started

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,730
happening no literally they had came up

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,040
and do work you know death from overwork

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,840
and then there's actually if you look at

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,090
the Wikipedia it actually talks about

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,880
this careless insu which is where people

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,590
actually commit suicide and everybody

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,570
see the movie gunmo right like that you

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,790
know that the Michael Keaton in you know

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,250
I dishonor my company if my end effects

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,570
so I wonder if like we're not doing that

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,030
really started young people right now in

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,580
Silicon Valley and we're having that

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:08,340
kind of my disarming and when we have

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,620
pretty amazing responsibilities I knew

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,120
that there was a podcast with Damon

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,489
Edwards and we were talking about like

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,680
this article and we think about like

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,270
uber right like I love Weber like like I

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,430
was a Buddhist I so we get a guy

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,970
food when in Budapest like that's it's

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,290
like we're gonna say right but the like

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,240
but imagine

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,200
like you are somebody who runs a semi

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:35,310
structure there and like your mission is

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,710
to eliminate yellow caps wait yeah like

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,410
I don't know I mean I get I wonder like

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,820
we're doing amazing stuff at sea in

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,420
these places and most of you people I

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,430
know or clothing amazing infrastructure

00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,430
are we being conscious of like are we

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,550
falling into that same trap that the

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,580
Japanese culture did so disclaimer I'm

00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:00,840
not a professional these are just my

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,630
thoughts my feelings you know it you

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,710
know just the best I can do is listen

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:08,310
I'll buy you a drink you buy me a drink

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,890
I don't know so this is where it all

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,830
started right this like soak this guy in

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,470
for a second just look at him seems

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,970
Carlos Flores and they didn't even

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,650
really know and there are certain people

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,900
I know like in certain cities like my

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,940
guy you know I know gay very well and

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,260
opere but this is one of the people that

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,670
I meet every time I go to just one

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,220
conference over your skin

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,170
so Lotus conferences go the go in there

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,180
for like six years now doctor first

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,770
conference was two weeks after I started

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,570
at chef on and get my first chef

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,340
presentation there it was the first chef

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,450
presentation there I know but let's

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,820
probably as I've gotten to meet this

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,220
this this guy and and every time you

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,020
doing this just this fun respectful like

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,310
we should have been friends for life but

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,990
then we don't see each other for another

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,520
year so that's Carla floors so this is

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,050
another picture on the right hand side

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,800
is a gentleman for Chris Webber he's

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,750
he's one in a local la DevOps folk so

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,880
and scale and in February this year I

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,180
have to see him at breakfast than what

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,460
we're sitting down and he says do you do

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,730
you hear about Carlo and I'm really bad

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,920
with faces and names and I'm like you

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:17,070
know I know what it is he committed

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,780
suicide and I was like and at that point

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,610
I was like oh that's tragic you know one

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,270
of our young people but I didn't really

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,040
realize what was and and so I just kind

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,050
of left it and then I went to the open

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,120
session and the guy in the middle large

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,500
Linton was doing the opening session

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,510
kind of like with Mike and he says look

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,210
can we all take a moment of silence and

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,340
he throws up is Carlos Twitter page

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,669
and I'm starting to get to see a feeling

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,699
like oh no please don't let it be that

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,350
kind of man like psycho look at this

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,930
lake their profile I'm literally racing

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,460
now to see is it is it that person

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,930
because last year I was having this I

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,090
already have conversation about how to

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,139
do a start-up with him and and not that

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,190
we were going to start together but I

00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,009
was trying to give him advice on

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,300
startups and I realized you know before

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,210
I even could get the pitch I'm like

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:08,130
costs him you know he would've been here

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,930
what's our and so I mean I lost

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,530
it right I really did I was in the back

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,930
of room I call my wife a mother Lorraine

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,250
crying because it just hit me so you

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,320
know they had the Steven Nelson Smith

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,060
thing and then I had one other thing

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,250
that hit me so about six years ago I

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,949
moved to Atlanta this is all of our army

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,430
bus you probably I'm repeating it but

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,110
I'm six husband Atlanta back to Atlanta

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,610
and I started a local flower group it

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,150
was his other young man named Walter and

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,669
I'll never forget his name and we we

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,169
went ahead he are free to go to Valdosta

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,780
University which is like three hour

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,490
drive because he wanted me to do a

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,830
presentation on cloud to the sea s

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,419
Department so he drove over three hours

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,639
down we talked about the industry and

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,159
land on good stuff and way back we

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,949
talked about life we talked about Roman

00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,720
history we talked about civilization he

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,810
told me about his dad I told him that my

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,220
dad and my relationship two months later

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,639
I get a call from his business partner

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,039
he couldn't suicide that's like and like

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,620
the same thing you know I'm not

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,020
experienced I live living in college in

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,099
this would you have this like God and we

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,490
should kind of in there

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:22,620
I couldn't just said one thing grab the

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:25,530
shirt pull right and until I had to so

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,479
actually I lost it for like that day it

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:33,360
kind of ruined my weekend I made the

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:34,979
best went home life kids work actually

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
it was right this is like it was

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,520
actually very stressful because actually

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,800
just going through the acquisition of

00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,020
the company

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,269
and Randy burden on the left there post

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,879
this picture like Thursday after the cop

00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:51,100
the tech found weak and then I just lost

00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,709
the version too because if some of you

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,119
know the guy right next to Revit is Jean

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,399
and a dear friend of Jean Jean Jean

00:08:55,119 --> 00:09:02,860
always talks about you know we need this

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:05,170
we need to you know make the helping a

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,040
million millions of IT professionals

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,470
have boundaries

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,329
that's his goal in life right and I put

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,119
this whole again archive blog article I

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:16,629
have to write this blog article so I

00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:18,429
wrote the bar and and it kind of it

00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,879
started from Steven Nelson Smith's kind

00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:23,889
of Hiroshi and then you know I found out

00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,990
about this idea and you know I don't get

00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,839
a lot of detail here but this is my

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,899
favorite Edmund munch pitcher it's

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,809
called a read Virginia Creeper and the

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,730
reaction to that blog article is like if

00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:38,949
you if you understand this picture it's

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,589
a stranglehold on the house right it's

00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:42,939
like strangely the kind of and that's my

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:47,829
god I knew we had burnt out with an

00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:49,899
issue here but I had no idea that um did

00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:53,410
my little view of it that I would get

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,689
hit so hard with the reaction it was

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,369
what seventy comments in about three

00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:59,920
days

00:09:56,369 --> 00:10:02,110
12 grand scheme of big viral things that

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,939
means nothing but in my little view of

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,999
the world this was insane twelve hundred

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,649
reach we are tweets people sending me

00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:12,149
eating out of 40 emails in three days

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,749
from people either I was convinced he

00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,579
the gnarly

00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:18,970
there's a couple of I didn't go like yes

00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,399
ain't is a drummer the people I I love

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,779
the people I don't know I can be charted

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,309
people I don't know and everyone was

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,819
like John I'm gonna tell you the story

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:31,149
and like I was like oh my god you you

00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:32,410
know you know it was a bunch of Stephen

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,939
ounce of Smith's that I've gotten these

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:39,339
same like let me tell you about three

00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:41,499
years ago or ten years ago and in so you

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,449
know I you know oh never another thing

00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:45,160
that weekend we actually just wanted

00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:46,360
last things I said the whole reason I

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,490
wrote the blog article is like if

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,350
there's somebody I know she's thinking

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,069
about I know it's like Pollyanna

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,019
it's like you know it's not that simple

00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:59,169
but I wanted to just say out

00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,920
loud that if you know and you're

00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,839
thinking

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,160
this and again I know it's not that

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,990
simple but call me and what

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,480
happened was like hundreds other people

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,839
said the same thing Oh call me - call me

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,870
- and that we get somebody basically on

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,730
a product said I've had it I'm going to

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,740
end it and there were three or four of

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,970
us gene myself and I'm Brandon and a

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,470
couple other people spend a whole day

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,600
working with this person

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:32,470
in fact gene is still working with this

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,790
person right and so so me and Jane did a

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,220
little bit of a post-mortem

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,260
and so Jesus and you have to we had to

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,440
more with this like this is it was an

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,300
onion plan how did she look right we had

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,670
to figure out like what when we could

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,139
just let this die so I you know I said

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,209
okay I'm gonna you know go through all

00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,620
the emails I got sent lots of links lots

00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,149
of positive hey John have you met this

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,100
person and got to meet some really

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,990
interesting people I've never met and I

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,660
think the two things you know in my kind

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,519
of simplistic boiling you down was that

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,579
you know it is obvious but maybe it's

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,730
not too obvious as a as a group like we

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:08,680
really stink at our feelings you know

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,660
somebody walks in with a cast on a

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,170
skiing trip like we all run over to sign

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:17,910
it right but it's depressing it's like

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:21,279
oh yeah I'm going to get coffee yeah

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,829
right like like we read early you're not

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,199
good at like listening and you know

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,740
that's the second point we really not

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:31,870
that good at listening and our worst and

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,839
because we're fixers right like our

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,519
first instinct is the fix things you

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,459
tell me a problem I'm gonna try to fix

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:44,769
it well it's sometimes people just the

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:46,899
fix is to just listen right so and so I

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,850
wonder the person that I got introduced

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,620
to this geek Clint guard I'm bad at

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,540
names but I have a link to some

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,769
presentations she's got like somebody's

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,269
like it early on in the tweet stream

00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,760
like you have to meet this person

00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,260
and I watch the video she's a German at

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,860
Davos and she has some things I'll burn

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:06,519
out and it's such as to pull it out I'm

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,130
Jacob their epic tennis is if you buy

00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,180
for you our people are disturbed

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:14,360
back then they said man for everything

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,950
but so I think you know this this quote

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,170
I think it is you know I say research

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,330
things that people who disturb not by

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,670
the things but by the view so the third

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,310
kind of point is we're really bad at our

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,480
own feelings I'm going to pad my own

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,950
feelings you know this is a great

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,110
example this cartoon I got give a

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,460
presentation and you know how I would

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,600
like lots of people come if I if there's

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,310
one thing I get out and some of my I

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,080
really suck at but suppose like been

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,880
pretty well and I'll people come up and

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,470
say you know that was really good oh

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,660
that was awesome but then there was

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,690
somebody on the livestream will complain

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,720
and I mixed the a in cap theorem or

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,600
something and and just tear me a new one

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,160
and like that middle one it's like

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,910
that's the one I remember all day long

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,500
but I thought I'm just in a shitty mood

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,800
and I was kind of rude to my wife and

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,680
you know what you know and and actually

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,570
this has been a problem with me in my

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,190
life I mean I've had little things

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,290
Normie where the next thing I don't even

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,270
realize that I'm being crappy to a lot

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,210
of people I love and that's it is a good

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,040
book and I've got a link to this it's

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,190
called feeling good to do moveth era P

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,380
and actually buy this david burns it's

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,000
kind of corny but and I'm not even

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,250
suggesting this for you this is

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,800
something I did but there's fun you do

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,230
check lists into every day and you

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,360
actually correlate all the feelings and

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,760
what you find out is somebody gave you

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,010
the finger in a car in the morning is

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,280
why you're having this drop down fight

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,620
with your wife like holy crap like I

00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,670
wish I would've known that I probably

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:48,380
wouldn't had that fun

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:56,150
so so the other research I did I found

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:58,420
is this kind of learning zone so and I

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,340
thought it was really appropriate for

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,230
for DevOps because there's a lot of

00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,730
tions here like this you know is this

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,170
kind of discussion of those three zones

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,990
there's a comfort zone learning zone or

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,880
the danger zone okay what comfort zone

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,700
like if you know if you've read Jean

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,980
Jean Kim's book the original book is by

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,040
how they call wrap the goal he talks

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,500
about trauma buffer rope slack putting

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,150
slack in our life how about slack never

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,360
came in for life right I you know I

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,790
don't know

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,360
the term personas we have to step into

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:34,050
this kind of smell the roses you know

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,860
and that the problem is like and I'm

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,190
guilty this

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,709
you know I'll use words like cuz I you

00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,800
got a spa he said cool Japanese turn

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,660
cuts in and taught right like and it's

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,779
good stuff like that's what we do we're

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,680
really awesome right but the problem is

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:54,120
if we're always in that kind of Kaizen

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,120
we run the risk of being in that danger

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,070
zone and when we don't know it we're

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,550
actually not in a good place we're not

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:05,519
really learning so we have to the goal

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,829
here is to basically kind of figure out

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,589
how to basically move from that learning

00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:13,769
zone that Kaizen just force ourselves

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:16,140
back into the comfort zone get that

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:19,380
refresh meditation yoga whatever right I

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:23,430
mean and recognize that there are a

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:26,070
hundred percent Kaizen it's not going to

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,200
be good and in the same gentleman to the

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,470
researches Kenneth Chan and you get it's

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,570
like he asks like okay can you pick the

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,420
zones right and it's pretty easy right

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,310
the one under the tree is pretty pretty

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,000
easy right it's it's it's the on the

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:44,430
shade watching them watching the waves

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,589
the one in the middle is actually you

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,779
know if you go with me probably going

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,300
out a little further each time maybe

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,130
learning how to body surf right not

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,440
going crazy and they're not go ahead on

00:16:53,130 --> 00:17:01,019
the right or left again the is is the

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,540
one who has to go out the farthest you

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,829
know I hey I can go out wait for other

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,540
than everybody else and I actually

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,829
although I don't look like it

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,319
I lived on Long Island I grew up in Long

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,929
Island I was a lifeguard at Spitz point

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,459
right like so it's a very speech for

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,230
riptides right and these are the folks

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,290
that get caught in a Riptide

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,929
so metaphorically that's what might be

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:24,209
happening to some of our young people we

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:26,130
feel that we're like so have to be so

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,640
awesome which we actually do and we like

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:35,370
being awesome that we don't realize when

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:38,310
we cross over so in my research again

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:41,400
like I'm not a professional you know I

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:45,060
mean but what my takeaways from jeans

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,980
ask like we definitely been talk and and

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,080
what's cool is I was in in Iraq earlier

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,690
than a week and they did have lunch in

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,910
I'm burnt out so they're like 30 of us

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,800
and interrupt right like like I get

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,300
DevOps get caring about burnout and

00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,880
let's do such as it but like it or not

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,590
was like the story of Sony's network

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,020
architectures and they would explain to

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,390
why only 30 I'd like you kidding me 30

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:12,570
and interrupt like you know did these

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:18,510
people like feelings and it's like show

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:20,790
me the packet in the so but but like

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,790
it's talking I had DevOps Paris a few

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,910
weeks ago we had a 70 people in a

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,340
burnout session right just opening up

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:32,100
and talking in fact it actually it was

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,700
hilarious like you know as I open spaces

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,400
go guess where we wound up if anybody to

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:47,550
get this free dinner tonight it's a

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:48,690
heart when you get to wife's firm it was

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,580
like that's the beauty of an open space

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,060
right like it just goes where it goes it

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,700
Patrick I know it wasn't even there

00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,320
that's very definite

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,440
and then listening you know just being

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,680
really good at listening you know it's

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,170
shut not like just listen I think the

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,260
invulnerable so this Jim

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,490
kill coupla guard you know has really

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,960
good videos and the one of the things

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,570
are one of our handouts morning videos

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,380
she says she says she likes to be silly

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:23,300
and so what I think she loves to do is

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,710
manually open automatic doors all right

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,600
so she's doing this and then they had

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,130
this new employee from Angier didn't

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,560
really understood the culture as much it

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,330
wasn't good language

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,270
he'd watch her every day about the third

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,780
day rose up tortoises I know you know

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:42,060
that does talking about no but why did

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,300
he open emanuelly and then she explained

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,880
to him how she was silly engines

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,080
a couple days later he started coming up

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,320
to and asking a whole bunch of other

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,120
questions about other things like I

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,930
during the holidays do you all put trees

00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,440
in your house like but the point was she

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,640
made herself vulnerable and there was

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,710
nobody else probably he was gonna ask

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,380
all these like cultural weird oddities

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,290
and then in a sense why did I get a

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,080
hundred emails from like 80 of them that

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:15,770
have people I didn't know buzz because I

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,880
made myself long ago so he's a gift like

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,890
you know I mean not only do you get

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,760
these silly old I'm probably over silly

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,530
but but I mean I think like the you know

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,720
we work around there's a lot of people

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,160
that we meet that are like you know you

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,900
know Mike was saying that you know about

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,030
me but I think all of us be like oh my

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,580
god John house pop you know and he is

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,950
he's amazing right but like we need to

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,710
make sure that we you know if we want to

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,820
play this game of helping people not

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,560
that people don't wanna

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,180
consciously do that I mean maybe

00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,490
thinking about being horrible being

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,740
courageous right takes a lot of guts to

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,250
talk about you know things about your

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,260
feelings right it's hard you know it's

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,970
still kind of that play you know again

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,290
the broken leg right like we dig it

00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,300
actually Wow

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,870
you know pro-q legged this particular

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:06,670
resort right like we don't like and then

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:12,640
here's the thing like um being kind

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:14,530
confident right the cost is zero Mike

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,960
you're awesome

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,950
Katherine the awesome Dave's not here

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,000
he's awesome

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:27,260
peter is that awesome like that's so

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,420
cheap and it's so true like so like it's

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,700
like a freebie that we can give right to

00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,470
people you know maybe people think I

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,720
over complet but I never give

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,600
compliments were not there but I think

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,050
complimenting and I can't imagine

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,750
ignorance that so what were so much my

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,160
observations here you know I think me

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,640
and gene talked about so that suicide

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,930
watch was really freaky and and this

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,090
gentleman who's going to probably watch

00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,560
this honor so I went back at first it

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,520
was just a comment and then he showed up

00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,460
on Twitter and turns out he was a mess

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,310
artists just everything about him was

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,420
like somebody I didn't want to be around

00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,910
and I realized you know that I don't get

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,050
to choose you know I you know I raised

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,000
my hand I said I can help

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,970
right that's why I had to either really

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,920
like soul-search like some of the

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,960
conservative views that this gentleman

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,360
and that that by itself is not but you

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,880
tie that with somebody who clearly had

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,200
racist comments and besides just

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,120
everything about like these are not kind

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,120
of all tightening around in my life

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,400
not even close right and but but it was

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,700
hard because one we couldn't get through

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,130
everything was yeah so why I'm still

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,110
gonna kill myself

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,550
and Angie talked about it and it was

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,800
like yeah there are these one percent is

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,330
that the best thing you can do so you

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,160
don't dive into this thing and this is

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,190
some of the video collage is to like

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,230
just navigate that into a professional

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,750
you know and in all cases navigate a

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,730
person to the professional but like on

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,850
these ones it's like you know you gotta

00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,290
be real Catholic for your own soul and

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,640
then there's the kind of the needs of my

00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,110
numbers and jeans we were just playing

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,600
with like you know so you got pick

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,870
numbers 95 they could've cut off point

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,240
and in a 4% like the rest of us it made

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,970
me that baby Carlo was in that 4% I

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,770
don't know but they're the ones that we

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,810
can do a really good game of listening

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,740
and in fact as I was going through this

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,110
morning I'm thinking about the

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,110
kidnapping right like maybe the

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:27,540
one-percenters are the chaotic and then

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:30,340
for percenters are complex complexity

00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:34,530
and the rest of us are kind of floating

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,530
and simple and complicated right

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,130
but yeah right like you know I mean what

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,450
are you gonna do with the 1% is no you

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,040
know I have it you know professor maybe

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,280
I take you that maybe I Drive you

00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,930
I don't know I mean she knows I'm gonna

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,880
run out of time I know this though all

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,380
the things I want to say that can but

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,690
she's a millionaire right like in jeans

00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,390
he's not a sad he's got two kids like

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,820
myself a little later in life not as

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,350
ladies meeting with the kids so you know

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,440
I like to spend a lot of time my kids

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,060
not traveling and and he was cheating on

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,370
a Saturday calling me and saying we need

00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,780
to work on this you know I've got to

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,880
give that kids bath can you take over

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,010
for next hour

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,090
and I'm like you know Gina like you know

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,500
my kids are screaming at me I've been

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,020
gone three weeks of their own

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,160
it's like okay I'll take over now and

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,770
then when we get to the whole point of

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,120
the look when I told Gina I said I said

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,130
I don't know if I can you know I I don't

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,020
I put my my and put it out there and I

00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:34,150
want to help people but like this person

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:41,170
scares me and she's like John is my

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:43,030
daily somebody's gonna descend on me he

00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,110
cheated still at one point gene was

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,970
having a dialogue with the person he

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,560
said it can't get a job dude gene set up

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,190
a mock interview with you gene did a

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,720
mock interview over like two weeks later

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,980
so anybody thinks gene is an amazing

00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,520
person you're so wrong and anytime I can

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:04,900
get with the Churchill in a reservation

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:07,480
I think this is my first so he coined

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,590
the phrase big black dog and I won't go

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,940
into it like you did some really good

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,280
interesting about his battles of

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,140
pressure to welcome to and in his battle

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,330
with Hitler I mean some really

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,650
interesting stuff there but the reason I

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,570
bring that out is World Health

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,980
Organization has created a couple or

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,500
really good videos and I have these

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,810
again from the split think our women new

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,630
kind of pointing in these the first one

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,040
is it's really for somebody who battles

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,140
with depression and it's very cartoonish

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,240
but it's this idea of this big dog

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,980
that's just kind of like you're stuck to

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,740
or everyone's about stepping on your

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,890
feet you just and it's like 10x bigger

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,350
than you and it's the depression and you

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,510
and it just puts you into like you wake

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,430
up and you're like not great or and I

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,740
can then do this - no I

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,770
all right I'll do one night of catharsis

00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,540
I and clearly over you every once in a

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,400
while tonight lose one's way anyway and

00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,590
when I'm in this zone everybody's just

00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,750
talking you need not y'all so the guy

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:07,960
sitting next got a plane sits down I'm

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:10,330
like sparking it like oh man I'm so

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,760
wrong he's so awesome you know but like

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,700
I do that I tend to have this like you

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,100
know black dog of like my kind of thing

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,730
said like a bugging me make me irritable

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:24,320
and then less yeah you want to talk

00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,750
about the saint on this planets my wife

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,060
and puts up high with me but this is a

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,520
great video for that it talks about some

00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,540
things like keeping the mood Journal it

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,010
talks about mindfulness meditation yoga

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,960
in the end you know for people who have

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,670
ever battle and I'm so glad the next

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,500
presentation is about anxiety but that's

00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,510
another thing I have battled heavily

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,220
with but some of these things for people

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:49,880
have had these forms of depression or

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,890
these like they don't go away in the

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,660
black dog scenario you get it to a point

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:56,150
where your training isn't controlling it

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,830
and then the second video is for the

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,820
caregivers of the people that you want

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,320
to help and it's really good because it

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,770
does a lot I gives you a lot of do's and

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,090
don'ts so if like people say like John

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,430
said hey I need to be more open I need

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:14,810
to make sure I read guys tell emails

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:17,140
from people who said hey I manage a team

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:19,640
I'm gonna make more read this blog argh

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,960
right so so you know there's lot of

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,670
people like I want to help it if we're

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,990
gonna help let's do it right like it's

00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,750
some of the things you don't do is say

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:30,310
it's all on your head like not good

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:32,570
thing to say don't say let me out right

00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:35,420
I hate you both busted through would

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,980
never do that but but but little simpler

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,530
things like you know there were people

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,210
way off worse than you these are really

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,670
bad things that's like compound single

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,340
effect on Monday we had that

00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,200
interrupting and they invited a pastor

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,380
who was a suicide prevention in Vegas

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,090
medicine about a bad job he gave some

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,730
stats on suicide in Vegas it was like

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,470
insane right and pentagram and near the

00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,670
end like he didn't say anything during

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,730
the whole presentation near the end he

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,320
he he said I heard me say let me get

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,230
some input and it was really good in

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,880
putting the one take with that still

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:10,190
kind of try to get my head around this

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,050
he said most people think when they when

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,850
a detective somebody is this is not the

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,290
video this is from this pastor but when

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,790
they think they're like somebody they're

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,960
concerned about like I loved one or a

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,610
friend or a good close friend or

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,830
co-worker and they think well they're in

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,140
this kind of danger zone your instinct

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,330
is not to say are you thinking about

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,010
fitting suicide say you're afraid to

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,920
think oh my god they're gonna race often

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,980
do it or you know for me it's like and

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,179
then I thought you know I

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,490
I kinda thought that too but I wouldn't

00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,460
be I wouldn't have a problem saying it

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,340
up though like if I knew somebody kind

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,279
of well and like and I knew they were

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,110
bad I'm like do I think it's a curse

00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,730
right like be bold and mighty forces

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,210
will come to your aid right like be like

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:54,090
um you know do you say like do it you

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,789
kind of do it like because what happens

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,100
it's a lot like home you understand me

00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:01,380
so it's kind of counterintuitive so

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,070
anyway this video is good it talks about

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:10,230
grow your ears open your heart listen

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:12,269
without judgment and then you know I

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,850
think that happiness thing is real

00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:17,039
that's happiness science right the

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,990
Constitution only gives people okay to

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,139
pursue happy you have to catch it or

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,970
it's a skill all right you know I

00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:26,429
rewatched the movie happy lesson so I'm

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,279
sorry maybe that's left about 6:30 to

00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:31,340
the party last night hit no and I wanted

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,899
to watch this again one more time this

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,269
this happy it's on Netflix just for

00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:39,059
happy it's a science of happy actually

00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:42,659
talks about Hiroshi and all that stuff

00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:44,220
too it's interesting again spend another

00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,600
half an hour 45 minutes talking about

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,809
some of the happiness science which

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,190
sounds pretty good to me so special

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,380
thanks to some these people I kept

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,630

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,350
Jennifer Davis has some really good

00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:29,850

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:53,090
that for that same hepatitis quote where

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,920
I wind up like being really rotten the

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,110
nasty to the people that shouldn't be

00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:02,840
because somebody was robbing asking me

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:05,300
who I never see again in my life and

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,060

we can do with my extra to business is

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:23,120
the conversation like people you know

00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:26,600

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,750
what happens in everybody so you know so

00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,880
I had earlier you could sir about

00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,280
anxiety early early early early in my

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,310
life I had bouts with anxiety and one of

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,160
things you'd actually start thinking is

00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,240
that you're the only one that has this

00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,060
right and then when you hear that all

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:48,220
you had that - okay maybe I'm not that

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:50,270
crazy or freakier right so anyway um

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,470
thank you for let me talk about this

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,470
this morning let me off

00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:15,920
sure I'm not a professional question I

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:23,420
think you're not gonna Street a lot of

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:26,390
people do feel like they have to be how

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,660
do you get past that and you're towards

00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,400
being okay with being father for this

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,620
heart right because you know one of the

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,160
things I mean I've had recently good

00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:40,070
experience with these CDs I spent 25

00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,220
years without startups and pretty much

00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:49,190
ABCs in the last two years actually kind

00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:51,320
of think them but but that they think

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,810
they said I'm really bad tone and starts

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,510
in the episodes of rally that starts

this like we in fact a lot of the emails

00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:01,490

00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,560
very driven by investments and

00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,040
investments are looking for big yield
