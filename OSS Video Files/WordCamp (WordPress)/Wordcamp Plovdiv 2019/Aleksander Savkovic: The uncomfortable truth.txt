Publication date: 2019-09-08

Description: 
	Diversity is not inclusivity and equality is not the equity. Lets make the WordPress community even better and hopefully change the world by helping marginalized groups.

you heard most of it Who am I why I will

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:15,980
speak about what elastic about and first

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,840
of all I want to introduce myself in a

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:25,190
bit different way than you're used so

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:29,390
it's obvious that I'm May and it's

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,580
obvious that I'm white location and this

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,719
is not obvious but there is my

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:39,379
girlfriend sitting so I'm straight also

00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:45,409
a middle-aged I mean my girlfriend would

00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:48,140
say crisis probably I mean 183

00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:51,289
centimeters high ninety five kilograms

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,670
maybe now 100 because of the sweets that

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:57,530
I am eating for the last couple of

00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:01,159
months and pretty much average not

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:04,420
especial nothing from outside of the

00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:08,710
normal margins boundaries or whatever

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:12,619
and if as Google Google things the same

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:16,310
when you type their human body diagram

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:20,750
you will have 95 percent of results of

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:24,409
white Caucasian male in middle age so

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,110
it's human so Google say when you're

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,560
human you are actually white Caucasian

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,479
male

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,350
you are not a woman if you're human

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:36,740
young man so that is the first type of

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:40,340
discrimination worldwide because if you

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,759
check on the status rose everyone go the

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,979
third one in the bottom row and there is

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,630
also in one more

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:53,320
both men moon so this is the part where

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:57,200
you already realize how big is

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,789
discrimination in the world so what am I

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,399
talking about this when I'm white

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:03,470
Caucasian male straight so I shouldn't

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,810
be talking about this it should be

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,450
someone else someone who is from Algenol

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,369
is good but maybe something from a Genoa

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,760
is good we'll never have a chance to

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,430
talk about this so that is why we need

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,000
to talk instead of them to be their

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,830
voice in the community and to help them

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,239
because we will always have a chance and

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,680
they will not if you don't change

00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,380
something so I always construct the site

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,150
supervisor for 12 years before my career

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:41,480
I will present IT then I was managing

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:43,940
150 people every day and 149 women there

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,829
is a joke on construction site what is

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,579
the best looking woman on construction

00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:53,090
site everyone that appears on the

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:57,170
construction site so I was working with

00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:00,410
men every day why me again I was deep

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,620
and tech house DJ producer for 15 years

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:06,340
I was really successful in that I was

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,769
playing music all around the world and

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:14,060
imagine what in top 10 DJ's there is

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:16,760
only one colored DJ and one who is

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,730
mixed-race it's a project his father is

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:25,310
Dutch and mother is from Serena all

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:27,650
other are white education so when I came

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:35,540
from that man's world - waitress

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:38,450
community 6-7 years ago it was WOW like

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,169
this is the best unit in the world we

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,989
are so open-minded we are so welcoming

00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:45,900
we are not discriminating will the

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,030
increasing

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:53,239
so important and important in this

00:03:48,030 --> 00:04:01,049
community but you mostly feel like that

00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:03,209
something that you know is back so first

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,650
thing that you learn when you come to

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,319
WordPress community when you become a

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,430
part of this community is that our core

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,079
values are diversity inclusivity

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,079
accessibility and equality that is

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,630
something that we always talk about like

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,910
there is a lot of women a lot of it's a

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,389
general quality and everything else we

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:29,160
are like let say some hipster style of

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:32,340
community but and we really are but I

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,280
think that we are using those words more

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,120
like buzzwords not like something that

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,910
will really give some effort into it and

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,669
not something that I think think that we

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,850
are really work on but it's something

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,530
that we like to talk about like our

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,360
community is awesome and if I ask you

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,370
what we did for inclusivity last year

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,169
can someone tell me what will proceed

00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:01,020
for inclusivity like in the in the last

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,840
12 months you're all from the Tres

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,669
community give you one example what we

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:14,460
did sorry

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:16,889
no do you see the time right really

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,289
important thing is also equity above

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:22,349
everything else and we will have at the

00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:24,630
end one simple exercise to show you what

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:29,070
equity is and why it's more important

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:33,030
than equality we're not doing that as

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,729
you see the rest of you are part of some

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,280
local workers communities and we can

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,490
give you one example what you did for

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,919
inclusivity diversity and equality or

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,750
equity in your community in your local

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,430
community and that is the place to start

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,830
it's not a place to start in work

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,479
computers over computer because there is

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,020
no no

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,469
and it's expected to happening in even

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,749
that high let's say the biggest

00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:01,999
conference but you need to start in your

00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:04,039
local communities in your meet up with

00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,809
20 people that is a place to start

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:11,180
it's too late when we come to the

00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:17,900
computer so once I was in Philadelphia

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:21,439
for welcome to us and the ring manual or

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,279
in the room of my colleague wasn't 27th

00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,620
or 28th floor and it was it cost more

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,050
than the rooms on the tenth floor where

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,099
the rest of the guys and as forget sake

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,289
why those on the top floors are more

00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,240
expensive than on the level force

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,909
especially because I was a smoker then

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,949
and I need too much time with the

00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:47,300
elevator to reach the ground floor to

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:51,110
get outside and reception study probably

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,990
because they have a better view on the

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,210
top floors and that is why we have now

00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,169
something that I call a realm

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,149
accelerator and you will figure out why

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,979
this a very nice elevator is so

00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:07,520
important so if you're on the first

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:09,139
level your life envision about the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,330
adversity about what is happening about

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,339
inclusivity about community because you

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,259
have too many buildings around and you

00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:18,560
can't see anything except the place

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:21,430
where you are if we're on the second

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,209
level some buildings around you're

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:30,020
shorter so you can see a bit better than

00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:31,999
guys on the level 1 and level 3 is

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,389
called visibility so you can see

00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:38,050
everything what's happened on the first

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:42,259
level people see diversity as of Earth

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:46,389
what is the problem here I spoke to a

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:50,010
guy in Belgrade and I was really

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:52,030
disappointed with that conversation

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,700
[Music]

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,610
oh yeah look I don't have a problem with

00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:02,670
gay people as long as they don't say

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:05,530
that they're gay like what you just said

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,800
because it's not obvious you would say I

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,870
don't hate black people and until they

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,430
say they're black but it's obvious when

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,580
you see the black person that he's black

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,950
and for gay person it's not obvious that

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,870
he's gay probably you need to find out

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,560
somehow but I said what is the

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,540
difference if he's gay or not we had

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,100
before before I find out I can

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,400
communicate normally and everything but

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,520
when I find find out if they tell me I'm

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,130
different

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,500
so that is that adversity don't feel

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,690
comfortable if you are surrounded by

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,070
some people that you're not accepting so

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,100
easily because you don't know enough

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:46,170
about that and it's okay but we need to

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,210
change that that was okay that was okay

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,030
but we need to change it from that

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:57,070
lowest level like local meetups and

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:59,080
everything else on whether - probably

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,520
the most of us are on this level

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:06,220
somewhere we know that it's morally

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,100
normal to have the diversity inclusivity

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,530
but someone else will do it instead of

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,350
us will I have to do anything sound will

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,640
because it's sensitive topic and we

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,560
shouldn't talk about that too much

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,900
because someone may be real haters

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24,040
because of this someone will will maybe

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,530
hate me after my talk today but more or

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,880
less I don't care if I help someone with

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,480
this talk from marginalized group

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,640
because I was helping enough - white

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,240
Caucasian male straight etc said it's

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:42,400
time to help someone else and on third

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:46,860
level you have to read this to focus on

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:49,480
through this the piece

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,720
especially on leading positions like

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,989
CEOs and leaving big projects knows how

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,429
important diversity is for the products

00:09:55,989 --> 00:10:03,639
and they know how huge value diversity

00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:13,119
is bringing the company to a product and

00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:16,199
to better executing a task ok let's

00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,879
practice something together

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:27,420
do we have Mike Rinder here awesome

00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:29,619
I believe Mike thank you first of all

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,029
require the situation when you felt

00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:36,279
excluded from some activity by a group

00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,319
so you expect it to be invited like to

00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,470
play football with your friends or to go

00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:44,379
to play xbox or you expected to be

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,779
invited for some party in high school or

00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:49,929
whatever just close your eyes and try to

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,449
recall situation when you felt excluded

00:10:49,929 --> 00:11:06,929
from group let's do it

00:10:52,449 --> 00:11:06,929
1 2 3 close your eyes all of you ok I

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:15,959
will recall some situation when you felt

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,959
excluded from work Sam don't be shy

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,689
someone anyone

00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:30,279
you will never excluded from any

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:33,669
activity ever know your lucky ones but I

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:38,230
can tell you that your I definitely

00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:41,790
because it's not possible never say why

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,779
you're shy we're all friends here

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,040
imagine that this is not friendly

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,620
environment how shy would you be details

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,960
from

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,150
marginalize group and this is the place

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,190
this is not friendly for you how would

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,970
you feel them you're not feeling

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:04,380
comfortable to raise your hand in front

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:06,360
of the environment probably we're shy

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,960
because we feel ashamed that we work

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,880
school it excluded people feel guilty

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,410
about the exclusion yep

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,030
that that's the point but with

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,740
discrimination we are doing that every

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:23,820
day to those people from marginalized

00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,680
groups you were excluded from some

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,110
activity maybe a couple of times in your

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,010
life and you feel bad about that and

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:36,570
you're shy to talk about that and what

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,850
is the energy now in this room not so

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,520
good huh

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:46,800
we're all like whom we shouldn't be

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:54,180
talking about this okey let's do the

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:56,640
same thing but a bit better yep oh yeah

00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,110
awesome I know I know it was the point

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,550
that is why I talk about that in public

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,740
let's recall the situation when we felt

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,540
included by some activity in group and

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,940
you didn't expect that you will be

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,210
included like someone right with you

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,010
awake you clear the inviting you for

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,190
this event I never expected that I will

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,190
be invited

00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:25,579
with antenna choices some faces smiling

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:29,459
changing from that sad face from before

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:31,589
so we to know that how you felt first

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:34,349
time when you close your eyes and how

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,479
you fell the second time when we talked

00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:38,879
about being included in some activity

00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:40,619
it's completely different energy now

00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,129
you're smiling first time you were all

00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:50,549
like watching in the floor and tried to

00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:52,139
talk about that view this imagine how

00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:55,019
people from marginalized groups feel

00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,779
every day every morning when they wake

00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:01,769
up they experience some kind of

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:04,709
discrimination some kind of exclusion

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,809
from a group where they probably wanted

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,309
to belong to they would like to belong

00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:13,409
to some row because it's not all for

00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:18,379
every human being to have that wish to

00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:18,379
be a part of some group of something

00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:23,459
when we see discriminations probably

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,889
especially because Bulgaria is now in

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,169
European Union that discrimination by

00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:32,909
any any type of discrimination is kind

00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:36,599
of as a alt turn like discrimination we

00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:38,609
are not doing that we have pride parade

00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:41,669
or something like that so you think it's

00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:42,779
enough they have one day in a year they

00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:47,220
can walk on the streets

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:50,129
we'll give them army armed troops to

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:53,129
support them because probably someone

00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:55,049
will kick their ass without that so

00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:57,269
we're doing enough we have a pride we

00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,929
will let them walk and that's it for

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:02,639
LGBTQ in example so one day in a year we

00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,669
gave them one day in a year and that's

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,119
it we're done we are so cool community

00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:13,709
because we will give them from 365 days

00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:15,269
they can have one it's happening actual

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,299
discrimination every single day right

00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:21,289
next to you because probably you don't

00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:24,479
know you are doing that every day

00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:26,010
subconsciously and you don't know that

00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:28,800
you're doing that

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,110
and probably very often you're doing

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,820
that because of your religious or other

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:41,640
beliefs when we talk about religions can

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:44,970
we agree that if we say this one that

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,580
probably all of you will think that that

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,180
is the most aggressive religion in the

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:56,280
world because they always have some Isis

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:59,580
some male terrorist organization with

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:03,330
Islam in the back but let me remind you

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:07,680
that we have like 100 sects based on

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:11,700
Christianity who killed 100 members 1000

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,500
members or whatever so that is just we

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,000
are Christians and they're Muslims so

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,590
they're more aggressive if you ask

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,340
Muslims they would say the same thing

00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:22,260
for Christians so you need to switch

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,000
shoes every time when you think about

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,220
someone else you need to understand why

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,890
they're doing something and why they're

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:35,250
like that discrimination is actually

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:37,410
okay sometimes it's okay when you're

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,380
discriminating historically privileged

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,980
group like me if you don't give me a job

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,800
if you hire this woman instead of me

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,350
it's okay

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:54,390
because I was the man was hired over a

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:57,180
woman million times in the last 100 or

00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:00,270
200 years so if you hire one time women

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:04,350
over a man is fine but maybe I will not

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:06,300
feel like that also it's okay when you

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,730
reject a dying person for a position of

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,910
a bus driver because obviously the blind

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,949
person can drive a bus also it's okay

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,770
when a woman or a man rejects to be

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:20,910
examined by an opposite gender during

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:23,070
ecologist or urologist because that

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:27,000
woman or a man could feel uncomfortable

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:30,990
to be examined by different genders the

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,120
doctor it's okay when the restaurant

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,179
rejects to organize white supremacy

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,909
dinner but it's not

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:43,309
to reject to hire colored person because

00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:46,669
your restaurant is organizing white

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:49,100
supremacy dinner and in this case there

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:51,919
is also one more team really interesting

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,029
maybe the angle of that restaurant is

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:59,120
not discriminating he is discriminating

00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:02,059
only because he thinks that if he hires

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:09,169
a colored person he will lose his guests

00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:12,200
for white supremacy first so sometimes

00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:14,869
it can happen that you don't want that

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,389
you don't want to discriminate but you

00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:23,720
think that you are forced and this is

00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:25,940
very often situation also it's never

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,289
okay to say I don't want to be examined

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,960
by a different skin color doctor or a

00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:36,110
different religion it's okay to be from

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,990
gender but not different it's not okay

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:42,110
to reject a woman for a bus driver

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,769
position because probably the woman is

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:49,070
more than capable to drive a bus then

00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:50,090
the same as any any man and there is

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,179
something that we call positive

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,470
discrimination this is the very

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,249
important thing and this is a good thing

00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,980
to do what we can do for the positive

00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:04,600
discrimination we can hire a woman over

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:07,970
man because every time when we have some

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,429
hiring process probably 95 percent of

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,720
applications in lighting industry are

00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:17,200
for men and maybe 5 percent or higher

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,259
along whenever men give them a chance

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,019
how any person for marginalized groups

00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:26,659
instead of me so I'm average so every

00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,840
time when I say me it's white Caucasian

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:33,139
male middle-aged so I had all the

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,679
benefits of my race and of my skin color

00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,350
all my life and except the women

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,169
speakers

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,850
with kampala men every time when you are

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:46,919
doing wacky except women rather than the

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,320
moment someone from LGBT rather than a

00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:54,299
man there is always someone to be

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,640
invited to speak because 95% of speakers

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:59,460
in the last ten years were men

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,049
now it's better situation but still we

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,090
don't have processes and procedures but

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,220
we are doing that because we think it's

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,370
ok

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:11,549
extra mile not just accept and not just

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:15,059
hire this sound applies reach out for a

00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:18,390
woman when hiring reach out for any

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:21,510
person from marginalized organic groups

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:25,500
and reach out for a woman speaker how

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:28,190
when you're organizing WordCamp there is

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,860
a lot of meetups like women in tech

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,820
front-end developers ladies are ladies

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,799
as them signing an email and say look

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,960
we're organizing welcome and would like

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,120
some of you to share your experiences

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,600
with jazz to share your experiences with

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,850
our language there is a way and very

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,600
often we say yeah but we have only we

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,820
had only five women applications and 37

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:59,700
men so that is why we have that ratio I

00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:02,789
tend to only time to sense of why as I

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,760
said if you hire a woman or a man it's

00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:10,230
not a big deal because I was hired so

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:15,080
many times over a woman is it fair well

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:18,480
as I said it might feel unfair for me to

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:22,320
have her hired on my position if we have

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:26,640
same competences because only because of

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,830
one reason because if we read the spoils

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,620
of the white male privilege for so long

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,179
so we are doing this for centuries it's

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,880
not something that we're doing for less

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,900
than years but we're doing this for

00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,940
centuries we were conquering North

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:46,230
America Central America South America

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:48,929
India and we have them colonized for

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,630
centuries for thousands of years and now

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:54,450
when someone from those colonized

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,990
countries should be hired over a white

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,299
man you know I think we are not feeling

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,929
good about that because we used to be

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:07,140
hired over them we used to be hired over

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:11,220
a woman because women they couldn't run

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,750
Boston Marathon until 1973 it's like six

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,720
years before I was born

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:24,270
it's not 100 years ago it's 40 years ago

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:26,010
it's not ages it's years and yeah we're

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:29,540
so spoiled that we can't accept that

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:33,360
someone is hired over us like probably

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:35,010
because of those our DNA changed by

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,500
years and that is how we were doing

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,290
discrimination and we think that we're

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,230
not doing that I was I had a huge fight

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,000
with my question in January because I

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,950
was 100% sure that I'm not

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,080
discriminating and she explained to me

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:54,840
the time and step by step I realized

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,730
that actually it's not only me its

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,309
entire community but you're doing that

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:01,650
passively we are not aware of that that

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:02,160
we are discriminating just they're doing

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,480
nothing

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,220
we are discriminating enough is there a

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,190
more relevant person for the

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,830
discrimination of course no families

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:22,830
I'm almost almost that always do

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:27,630
something you should try to get to know

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:29,940
someone from LGBTQ immigrants or racial

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,240
minority people with little or no

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:38,130
economic resources all these are

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,450
marginalized groups some women or the

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,590
elderly ex-convicts

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,870
drug addicts or illiterate these are all

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:49,590
marginalized groups you have their lives

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:52,290
are mostly in the loop you don't have a

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:54,520
chance here then you fail here then you

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:56,350
feel here and you're not trying anymore

00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,290
and when we say yeah but they don't want

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:01,600
they don't want to try they did they

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,850
tried million times they failed

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,340
no one ever helped them and of course

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:10,090
that they will not try again especially

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,710
for let's say an ex-convict and while we

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,110
are going back to prison because no one

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:25,600
will hire ex-colleague and you don't

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:28,990
know if new a battalion is where a bit

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,980
and some noise and people with

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:35,770
disabilities you will see that you have

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,550
no than more things in common with them

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,480
than you thought

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:42,460
then you ever think about and you you

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,590
will see that you you have only maybe

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,140
one difference with someone from

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,540
marginalized group and probably you have

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:53,580
no differences with me then someone from

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:56,260
Algenol is group why let's do something

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,179
which kind of music do listen electronic

00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:04,120
music can you ask and if you listen you

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:08,740
know electronic music okay look awesome

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:13,120
 last one

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:18,220
I expect to this Apple phones Apple

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,650
devices okay Samsung you know why we're

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,100
doing this you don't know look look

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:27,610
around when you raise your hand the

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:33,370
right now summer winter spring summer ok

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:38,790
winter March a spring okay and the last

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:42,559
your favorite color blue red okay black

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:45,529
okay if

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:49,759
who raised the hand probably every time

00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:52,370
it was mixed who is using Epiphone

00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,159
didn't have the same color with a person

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,889
who liked the same music as you so all

00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:01,429
of you were mixed someone like this but

00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:03,379
use this sound like this but use that do

00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:06,409
you think that it does really matter if

00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:09,499
there is some black person or LGBTQ

00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:12,049
person or a woman or a man we were

00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:14,419
talking about something else so probably

00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:16,369
they will bring me one thing different

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:20,059
between people from marginalized groups

00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:31,490
and you and it's sexual orientation in

00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:34,730
example but probably some of them are

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:37,580
showing more interest with you than

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:41,149
someone for whom you think that is more

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,460
compatible video the only compatibility

00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:46,039
of the person with different sexual

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,600
orientation video is maybe the only

00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,570
difference between you and that person

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,309
and you listen different kind of music

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,629
you like different kind of art you like

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,940
different kind of movies you're not

00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:57,590
watching the same TV show you like I

00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,820
don't know Game of Thrones he like

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:04,220
something else but with a person who has

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,470
only one thing different from you and

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,990
that is sexual orientation you have all

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,149
other interests the same so I'm not

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,580
compatible with that person than with

00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:16,519
the person that you thought because you

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,309
were afraid probably that is why I said

00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,100
tried to get to know a person from each

00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:25,690
of marginalized group just to see how

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,690
many things you have in common with them

00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:33,499
would you ever really spend an hour with

00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:35,299
me talking about football and about

00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:39,139
things that you really don't care about

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:40,730
or with someone from some marginalized

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:44,320
group who sharing the same interests

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,320
video honestly

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,760
like to spend an hour with someone from

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:55,260
marginalized group rather than someone

00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:58,380
from a faith with me because I'm pretty

00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,929
much of course the most of us would

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,850
rather spend an hour with someone from

00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:06,929
our journalist group why we're not doing

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:10,320
that why we are still afraid of people

00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:12,899
from our jihadist groups the 21st

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,690
century let's let's change it try to do

00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:18,269
what I said try to get no sound from our

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:21,690
jaw drop at least one person from each

00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:25,110
try to talk with them and to see how

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:30,240
much we are failing in being humans just

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:37,110
because we don't know how to let's say

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:39,659
deal with differences so what I said

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,929
equities were important what equity

00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,789
means I will need four volunteers not

00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:47,669
volunteers camp volunteers but some

00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:54,179
people from audience Oh awesome you're

00:28:47,669 --> 00:29:04,440
here what is equity we have one small

00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:12,769
task come come with me and you can come

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,769
now like yeah

00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:29,810
so I'm the tallest one possess okay

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:32,300
the task is simple you need to touch the

00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:36,050
same spot as I'm touching right now and

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:41,690
I will stand here come now you do to go

00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:49,070
by using algebra take it take it take it

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:53,030
easy so this is equity and stand next to

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:58,130
me and this is a quality that is the

00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:01,070
quality so inequality we have we have

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:04,670
the same starting point and it's not

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:07,730
fair because I'm ten centimeters taller

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:12,080
than his and we have the same tasks so

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:16,460
it's fun it's the last slide actually so

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:21,890
I'm like in one minute precise so equity

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:25,580
means giving the same level for everyone

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:29,720
so if the task is to touch that point

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:32,450
and I have advantage they need to have

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,130
the same advantage so if you miss them

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,470
ten centimeters small using 10

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,360
centimeters to climb up then we can

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,630
compete for the position for the same

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:45,200
position but if the task is like this

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:48,020
that they don't and they have anything

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,660
to climb on I will be in a huge

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:53,300
advantage over them so that is a quality

00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:57,200
and every time when we say quality

00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,590
recall this situation so a quality is

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,750
not enough because a quality is the same

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:06,290
starting point and we can't have say if

00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,750
we run 100 meters with Usain Bolt you

00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:11,570
need to start running one 50 or 60

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,970
meters because he will catch you even on

00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:17,650
those 40 he will catch but you need to

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,650
have some advantage thank you

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,960
if you have any freshens thanks for

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,440
being here first you have any questions

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,960
for me I will be around for like an hour

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,020
we also have one we are starting one one

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,890
website it will be diversity by dot me

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,080
and we will have diversity map and you

00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,300
can find us and you can find me WP Alex

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,220
if you have a company and you think that

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,950
you are doing enough about diversity or

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,290
you think you are not doing enough you

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,750
can as contact me will give you some

00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,730
advices how to improve processes and

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,670
procedures and we'll put you on

00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:02,810
diversity map there will be a map with

00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:05,420
you you will be able to post doc pols to

let's say share your experiences and I

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,160
think that it will be a great place like

00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,870
good starting point to share experiences

00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,500
in our community and to improve

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:18,110
diversity and inclusivity in at least in

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,380
our community in our industry thanks a

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,380
