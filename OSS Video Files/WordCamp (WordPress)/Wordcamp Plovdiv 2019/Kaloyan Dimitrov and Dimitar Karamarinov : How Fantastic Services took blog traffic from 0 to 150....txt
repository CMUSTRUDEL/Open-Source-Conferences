00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,459
stick to English

excuse me African police

00:00:48,140 --> 00:01:50,000
okay so okay okay interesting but nobody

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:55,850
has called up because we disagree on the

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,530
era grounded but what we do is we

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:04,159
actually operate on three different

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:08,509
markets we have people in UK US and in

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,769
Australia and what we do is improvement

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:15,350
domestic and commercial services for UK

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,870
customs it's actually we have this is

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,730
this another web science now run family

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,390
we have what's entertaining for

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,880
investors

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,690
there's officials on doors and all that

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:32,580
jazz home repairs fantastic elements

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:46,650
about both domestic and commercial of

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:49,010
course involves two more blocks yeah

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,700
then our business to business

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,890
acquisition websites all those services

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,130
they have to perform at people these are

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,580
our franchise partners

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,070
so each of them is specialized in

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,280
different service and our job is to

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,870
actually do all the marketing stuff and

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,150
we have to have a big sales team in

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,370
Burma so we're kind of candling called

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,370
operations it's a franchise model yeah

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,050
pretty good all right but why we are

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,600
really here we want to talk to me about

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,519
our box and because this is the

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,890
WordPress event and we want to share

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,650
with you a successful box story and

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,760
maybe it just inspire a little bit along

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,980
the way so what happens in the beginning

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,500
actually we started around five years

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,260
ago and we did not actually have any

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,450
idea what to do with WordPress stuff or

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,620
many posting for Google+ stuff of that

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:53,730
it was really in the beginning we really

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,650
had no idea what to do zero idea of K

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,200
other such an optimization will just

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,170
post random content in if something work

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,420
or have I

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:06,790
strategy that they never substance

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:10,880
invested contrary to now now we actually

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:14,300
dig deep into a lot of things in the

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:18,859
digital marketing in the search world we

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:22,120
are digging deep instamatics in natural

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:25,180
language processing in keyword research

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:29,030
so all those topics in between as well

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:41,720
yes that's it ranging from painted about

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:44,120
Intel Architecture in France websites

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,570
that you already saw from the different

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,890
services didn't even have a walk so we

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:56,330
decided to install we build um but as we

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,770
told you so there was a problem with so

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,840
many different things that we were

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:04,190
trying to the beginning we actually

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,220
deploying part was something within a

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,830
society and were mainly focused at the

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,970
money pages in actually leads yeah the

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,130
service greater set canister but

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,479
gradually we've got the brands and so we

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,669
have to start to do something about

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,680
those science some kids get a blog we

00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,690
got a blog here and they're gradually

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,690
against the best day because honestly

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:30,800
nobody in the company the least in walks

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,350
so yeah the issue was about when we were

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,169
doing the Box in the beginning we didn't

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,970
have the main strategy we're going to

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,560
get the traffic from so we were trying

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,020
to actually the right topics but mainly

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,700
the people will be interesting quite

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,970
doing some lists or will something that

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,990
could get via or whatever swing shortly

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,420
we understood that this is not one

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,830
work so we have to concentrate on

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,010
something that is actually bringing

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,690
people consistently every day so many

00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,460
our main thing was to switch to

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,770
consistency this is where the not

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,200
happened so we actually targeted

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:09,480
keywords that are always bringing new

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,150
users new readers this is called quite

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,910
ever new content and this is what helped

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,630
us in the beginning to really start it

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:21,450
on one say in the beginning as mentioned

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,580
just stuff it with random content and at

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,770
one point we have a lot of content that

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,050
wasn't performing at all neither

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,000
insertion either user engagement or

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,180
anything close to us

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,020
so when actually Cowell was assigned

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,640
with managing system and feels like it's

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,260
just good everything that does not work

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,370
so much it's pretty much all about

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,590
content and started again with is your

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,460
mindset like let's actually target

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,160
something go after keywords schedule

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:59,400
yeah but this was not because look at

00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,650
some fancy kind of settings then it goes

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,630
up into the social media no we just

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,110
wanted to be consistent for us and for

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:09,210
our team and to know by this then is

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,480
they were going to can walk so that we

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:17,870
won't get like bingo system so this was

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,870
just power with simple sketch oh yeah

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,200
in the beginning it was just the

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,120
[Music]

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,690
architecture that categories just costs

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,460
so the screenshot the next one this

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,460
pretty course but we actually

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:45,040
- to structure the contents and to go

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,830
after ages a support on the door it was

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,410
terminal our business pages we miss them

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,230
about this and okay here come and this

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,090
is now we're gonna go deeper actually

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,830
why's different and it's a big deal

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,830
because it was a big deal to get it

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,990
where it is right now

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,950
and actually what is that yeah but the

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,440
next level basically so now what we

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,780
do is actually we're trying to write

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,510
naturally for Google so that and also

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,150
put the user so we are trying to catch

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,580
these little snippets which are usually

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,000
amazing familiar with feature snippets

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,800
not familiar okay so basically in fact

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,890
you can experiment these are the top

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,960
boxes that you gonna see ever more often

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,540
when asking simple questions to get

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,250
straight answer and it's randomly polka

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,130
random it's put from one of the

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,650
velocities at position 0 and it brings

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,479
about a then the very moment sir you

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,180
know basically you can get this position

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,220
in Google if you optimize where your

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,770
pages to both pages and then you can get

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,690
another one independent from one to ten

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,670
where you are actually ranking as well

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,510
so you get actually accomplishes what is

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:59,130
a constantly changing and new formats

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,990
pop up they constantly taste different

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,800
results for the features

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:07,350
there's a lot of tweaking on that just

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,080
as long so this is why we started to get

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,570
deep into a natural language processing

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,980
this is a turret that you may also get

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,210
familiar with when you below it is

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,550
basically how Google reads things and

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,710
mice and understands it and trying to

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,080
make sense of it and trying to make it a

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,820
little bit more recognizable to humans

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,890
tells anybody to connect there's a to

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,790
natural language for this until it's

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,890
frickin just based how it works its

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,020
gonna show you and simple sentences what

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,600
released what how actually doesn't sell

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,290
the idea that if you know the basics of

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,720
how it works its way easier to go for

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,360
teachers minutes if you actually find

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,910
welcome well people density if you find

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,400
this on Lincoln you will see that we

00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:09,390
have our presentation from another

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:12,810
conference Linux well numbers started to

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,660
rise with so traffic rising key words

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:19,200
some that we didn't even expect some

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,890
articles start to get a lot of hits one

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,530
recently hit like 100,000 just for one

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,140
piece which was big for as it then they

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:32,430
kept it as a target and started seeing

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,650
results this is why we kept to see how

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,110
we can improve so we decided to increase

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,820
the scheme size and toast implement some

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,170
debug service as well as kamioka-san

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,110
both of stuff white move on Alex

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,790
mr. later and poachers Oh coach there is

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,230
a tool that is partially creating heat

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,910
maps on the site then you can see where

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,420
the users are actually interacting in

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:57,680
the familial channel and eccentrically

00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,529
do a lobster shop you can see videos on

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,120
their content and if the lab respect for

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,510
example for our assistant business

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,610
content to see where people have

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,860
difficulties in later learning program

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,690
improve the content and the good thing

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,880
is that we actually start to get

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,000
franchisees coming from informational

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,329
content people signed up as saying as

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,279
our partners Excel that works and is

00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,709
subtly worth it if you can

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,800
the final goal yeah that's really

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,870
something work your this much effort

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,589
it's good to mention that we have a big

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,449
team already right before you write I

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,750
think that total is about 20 people that

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:42,670
somehow one way or the other gave the

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:46,600
world of the Box the Box information on

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:50,959
actually we cover continents away from

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,880
almost the hottest we got like priceless

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,820
information on how to start a business

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,690
how to buy a franchise these questions

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,820
may sound simple but people actually

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,420
have the intent behind also depending on

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,060
what everybody's after even though they

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,699
sound simple don't underestimate system

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,860
because if it satisfies a person gonna

00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:15,290
get a new client or a nudey

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,690
right now we have think that block is

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,570
the biggest China bringing traffic

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:24,890
bringing free traffic every day our

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:27,410
business okay so now we can go a little

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:31,459
bit deeper into some of those aspects

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:34,730
that we briefly already mentioned one of

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,910
the things that we found was couple of

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,550
years was

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,370
this kind of structure that is kind of

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,920
hot right now in the SEO digital

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:48,240
marketing field and everybody unfamiliar

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,210
with a pillar coastal concept okay long

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,640
story short as image shows if you have a

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,400
page that's important when you're

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,160
surrounded with subtopics or have it got

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,440
smaller or why their topics are not more

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,390
narrow topics you don't see this is a

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,150
closed are seeing that page in the

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,810
center is important something that links

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:12,210
matter pages it actually works great so

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,150
for example if in the middle you have an

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,130
article about carpet cleaning tips so

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,400
this is kind of quite quite general

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,750
article and then you can have different

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,900
subtopics which you can spread into

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,900
different other articles about going

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:33,960
from yeah one tells for all those

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:44,190
searches then all the different kind of

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:46,770
training methods and other questions yes

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,360
yes they are bi-directional and we are

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,580
actually trying when we are looking from

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,470
the subtopics were trying to link with

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,240
the at least with the keywords we wanna

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,460
run the main one for but we make it

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,030
naturally we don't try to spam it too

00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,010
much so that was that's important

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,900
okay so this is kind of quite a visual

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,320
representation of both of you across

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,630
that might walk why you're a sour brown

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,830
so we can google them you can see when

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:17,620
you go around you can see again doesn't

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,960
either is possible for that website

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,960
because I think about this example is

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,090
that the entire structures outside of

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,980
the blog I mean something with the blog

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,390
directory it's a standalone part of the

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,230
website

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:40,870
each of these insects to see cover is

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:42,580
it's its own poster virus won't tell us

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,130
everything is structured on searching

00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:55,060
there is no page or URL it doesn't go

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:56,710
after research we were thinking about

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,070
coming to make the categories more

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,560
valuable and what we can do so that our

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,880
categories is not just there what you

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,410
know when WordPress you just kept the

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,050
categories but what can you do more with

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,520
those pages like they are even no pages

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,500
if you think about them

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,940
just when you take over there just ask

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,130
geography there just for navigation

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,250
right no you can actually make them more

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,500
vertical when you make the content there

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,970
like when you constitute your tips for

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,440
example right we have all four pieces

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:32,440
you or we understood so for example you

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,270
have the Darlington tips but useful then

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,400
the categories kind of summarizing

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:41,010
everything is like the pure solid are

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:44,230
going to emptiness and this blog tab

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,170
became very little bit and we're trying

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,070
to shift into something called a library

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,080
just in your head

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,020
another blogger to just post them and

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,530
you can transform it in pages that make

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,070
sense

00:15:53,530 --> 00:16:02,170
beside the mayor category blog which is

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:04,630
back to the custom and category of in a

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,440
simple WordPress site then you see all

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:10,270
the works there why did they become the

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,790
pagination down there and it's it's kind

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:17,320
of like very very simple we try to make

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:19,210
more valuable in terms yes so these are

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,340
basically our main categories this is

00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,210
something we launched they clear after

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:28,270
the reason it took a while to go live

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:30,190
but it's got a share because and these

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:36,910
are just our main categories to go after

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:38,950
some of our main services advice you may

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,350
want to go with the people in poster

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,060
sound with walk so I awoke post can also

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,820
be a few requests or it depends on your

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,030
niche it depends on your way of working

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,750
but you can also if you really know how

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:54,970
you will structure a content and at one

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,480
point you can really take the lead and

00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,940
try to put the informational content

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,490
under these service pages which is

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,189
something the pages that work normally

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,829
the topics yeah continent works great

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,199
from a standard blog post will start to

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,110
slowly when written under our service

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,820
pages because

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:18,010
when you publish a piece of content in

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,870
example and our kind of English we're

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,030
not sure if it's going to go under the

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,240
plumber ready to show some sometimes

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:28,030
doesn't really fit in one particular as

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,710
a father so in talking to taste it first

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,270
and when you see what words you can

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,200
segment

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,539
in structure what goes where because we

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,779
mask a lot so are you doing cells cell

00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:41,419
structures when you put something other

00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:43,890
in a second

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,659
all right another thing that we invented

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,970
the growth of all further was to

00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:50,279
implement CDN which is content delivery

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,440
network which is actually a way that you

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,240
deliver some meet some of your media

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,130
like images for example question is

00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:02,820
there anybody familiar with the CDN

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:05,820
concept it's good to mention our blocks

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,700
were really slow technical and what's

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,700
the supersoul however using shortcuts

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:17,010
that you broke every here and there in

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,230
the long term this is why we wanted to

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,480
look great as well and as better we'll

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,520
go said in the morning we have greatness

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,970
because otherwise we are going to be

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,279
lost so we are great with a brick and

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,779
now we are exporting the usable walks

00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,799
motions which are going to help us with

00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:36,990
the structuring of work costs and spoke

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,720
about getting faster because as we

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,640
mentioned Canada team and jacquard

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,110
can consistent all over the board and

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,940
that's making it easy alright another

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,340
thing that we implement in designers

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,320
that we try to fund to make the content

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,110
more findable so we implemented search

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,970
bars on the home page what it's more

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,220
prominent right now and also on the

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,230
category pages and now we see some

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,700
increases in the searches so in the

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,779
beginning there were about five or six

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,480
per month now there's much much more and

00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:12,309
it's good to mention that back then when

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,140
we did not have a dedicated foundation

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,700
usability he dedicated much traffic

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,710
cannot people actually go into the

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,380
college because more usable and they're

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,670
sort of educating and learning that is

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,380
there so it's sort of fun to see them or

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,720
is this the second section in this is

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:34,250
about the fog which is below just cover

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:47,020
us post here and below and without the

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:50,480
collection which is and give us because

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:55,570
now I was talking about to try to to

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,890
keep house a to Joseph I know if

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,559
anybody's not familiar of the power of

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:03,980
internal links and how good structure

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,809
can really push it on results but these

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,260
are the ones we want to juice up in

00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:12,140
terms of climatic Saudis targeting

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,240
general keywords below each of these six

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,410
main ones we have some categories again

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,740
everything's based on search but they

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:33,980
are not get indexed because so content

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:36,050
inside but slowly there's new things

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,740
coming out from Google I don't know if

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,120
you could fall but the cup of this the

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,530
conference ended and they said that they

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,890
are going to bring us a lot of new

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,760
things about especially about

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,570
informational content in terms of

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,760
structured data

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,790
so if nobody's familiar with structured

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,150
data it's for example these little stars

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:58,790
I've seen who is familiar with

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:01,830
structured data using it

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:04,560
all right so when you google a website

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,140
and when you see it when you want

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,120
something and then you'll have the

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,340
results and then sometimes you may see

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
stars for exaggerating see our price

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,320
range

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,520
she's a part of structure data so these

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,850
things that you see in the meta

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,490
description in the meta stuff in the

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,680
Google page so basically we're going to

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,390
explore in the future the how-to ones

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,480
which are going to be released very soon

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:30,300
from Google so if you're working on a

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,150
car to walk or stuff like that just pay

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:37,070
attention we're bringing this how do you

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:40,490
think because we figured out it for us

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,650
even though this sounds simple is how to

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,780
cut a shoe how to change a light bulb

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,590
they're actually people searching for

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,920
that and many of those can serve a

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,370
business goal and at least for now it's

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,080
pretty easy still to rank for such terms

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,690
and it's bringing a lot of traffic as

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,090
you see in the first number the earrings

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,250
growing actually our graph is going

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:10,650
right in there and why it's worth of

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:13,440
going after sixth place another thing is

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,970
tracking we we don't want to shoot in

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,650
the dark anymore we want to know our

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,840
resource interacted with the website

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,090
this is why we have a few customer

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,040
metrics as well but we're also using the

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,050
main things that almost everybody is

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,620
using it nowadays like Google Analytics

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:31,080
and called jar as well but you know that

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,030
before we started to do it

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,560
go time ninja tracking like specific

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,790
events in traverse we had a lot of data

00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,059
that wasn't

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,370
and that's why we have a dedicated

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,830
person who actually look into the matter

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,750
to figure out how what works

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,270
and get into that kind of thing so you

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,299
can actually get these metrics which

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,500
yeah but we also think that when the

00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,960
user is interacting with your website

00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,910
and if you're mainly writing for calc

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,120
when you want people who actually read

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,559
and engage with your content and then if

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,330
they are not actually clicking on

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,510
something are they are we going to just

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,400
call them a loss not really because they

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,380
might be engaged in the combos we really

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,890
don't know if we're just looking at the

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,570
simple google analytics dashboard it's

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,020
just one of like the bounce rate

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:26,190
triggers when the user is not I mean

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,740
interacting with anything this is some

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,280
distance it didn't work for some

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,650
yourself

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,600
we have like five one here clicks should

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:36,390
have now changed positions going back

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,679
for seen videos then sometimes in

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,679
general data okay

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,360
this is why we wanted to combine the

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,710
scroll depth and also the title page so

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,570
if a person is scrolling every stop 50%

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,070
of the page and is dangerous one minute

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,720
on the page we're not going to win

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,610
because they have they might have

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,220
engaged with the content actually better

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,809
than people who didn't do that so this

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,470
is why we have this adjusted bounce rate

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,940
and pretty much 20% 30% of all traffic

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,240
is actually pointing to this category

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,580
which is amazing and to put it in

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,080
perspective who see people from these

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,419
pages going to our homepage and about us

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,860
a club page for a membership age is

00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:24,929
rising and we're tracking people that

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,049
actually subscribe and buy our

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:30,600
membership program we see that happening

00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,970
which is amazing from a guy who's

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,730
searching what uses that word hammer

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,080
which I personally believes never

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,090
believe is going to be trafficking is

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,679
bringing a lot of traffic and people are

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:47,159
going to be coming clients which is why

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,990
you can't follow this because in terms

00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,480
of ok ok what we want to say here is

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:56,009
that back then three years ago we can

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,639
never have any problems with using

00:24:56,009 --> 00:25:01,769
images but to put just the one of our

00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:04,110
examples we found out that there are

00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:06,899
people applauding you just said to be

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:10,500
free for yours three uses with CC is

00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:13,559
your license a big website like because

00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,049
I'm a big speaker and they turn our own

00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,860
turns out the that those images are

00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:23,940
actually commercially licensed we even

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:27,750
have to kill one few domains that had an

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,610
image posted in the Google+ account it

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:35,480
was verified on they have a friend and

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,810
it was copy it was crying

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,060
awesome so I even had I went to the

00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,860
facility forum posting you guys while

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,680
you're doing this this is just said to

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,320
be free now and so it was one of the

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,170
cases that would figure out it's a scam

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,770
and if you're losing images are

00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:58,430
commercial page with commercial ending

00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:01,790
you can get a nasty email and you should

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:05,150
really go check images to do even after

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:08,000
we figure this out supposed to check out

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:10,550
images in terms again the rather door

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,500
images it we talk about prejudice and

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,540
how they want and now it's something

00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,930
that we're really scared of because the

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:22,010
numbers were big enough to matter we are

00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:23,660
by Thomas just paying for lessons

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,160
yeah if you don't have the money to buy

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,640
the images because they can be expensive

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:32,510
videos different checks like denied for

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,550
example is not help you to nice as your

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,200
Chrome extension is a common extension

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,810
from the understandings images which

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:46,040
such such as great it's better than fine

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:48,740
images Arizona okay moving forward of

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,720
sublimation images so how we actually

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,210
make this box just a few words to share

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,910
our process what to do is the result of

00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:59,060
a call kiss keywords intended semantic

00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:01,460
sensors those are four aspects of

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,430
research with undertake before we

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:08,210
actually start right on order

00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:11,290
whatever subcontinent killers understand

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:14,360
that will you still find the killers you

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:16,160
close the doors they here to figure out

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,640
what you should have in the past what

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,350
not what fits was too broad etc today

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,390
when we have the key words who started

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:27,470
it into the surface to figure out

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:30,410
intense we've kept both that we thought

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,730
were targeting the topic but later on

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,520
for another actually the information

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,950
said was not I think think that the real

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,070
user has and it took us a while to

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,020
figure this out of the level we can

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,680
constantly ship is certain that the

00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:48,410
intense okay so semantics just got

00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,110
mention again that NLP natural language

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,640
processing module who is it is Martin

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:56,210
and we're working in the

00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:01,490
english-speaking markets where you can

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:04,190
sense that like strong so besides around

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,930
keywords exact match we started to

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,600
beacon cinnamon synonyms related

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,990
keywords term six hitters here just to

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,480
make the semantics as rich as possible

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,790
air last three constants constantly

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,680
excerpts because there are other updates

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:24,890
the last here and we'll see serves just

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,900
change totally and if you wanna before

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:30,170
it's time to invest into a blog post

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,970
page or even to see what's working right

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,980
now there are tools that allow you to

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,990
see history back in time just so you

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,110
know where you're investing in a

00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:43,370
shooting in the dark and when we had all

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:45,030
these got them to a summary that's

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,790
sucking

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:50,560
compactly sorry yeah that's it okay

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,990
let's say leather kilowatts intent

00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,870
semantics and search information what we

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,090
do there alright so we compare all this

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,500
in a Content great but we do that

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:05,860
because we we work with writers so we

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:09,570
work with copywriters providers who need

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:12,670
the more information on the MinnKota set

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,710
so we compare it in the nice Google

00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:17,110
document you can use whatever you want

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,400
if you're compiling your content breaks

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,990
so in a cockpit brief we usually put the

00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,020
of course the title of the topic and she

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:29,640
that was sent by this kind of thing

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:32,740
things that you have to put what the

00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,480
number of what we need as well but

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,330
they're looking to buy again right you

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,330
know it takes a lot of a lot of writing

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,720
second unless you're a natural but if

00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:47,380
you want to get a patient works of

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,540
Afghanistan okay okay we host went up

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,310
processing will certainly understand

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,320
that without wasting time without waste

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,720
wasting resources inverse takes a lot

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,760
than just a front post can take two

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,980
hours to get it to debrief before

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,490
writing it actually so that was the

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,490
content grief

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:09,040
yeah when everything is said and done

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:13,090
and when the post is published we may go

00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,760
to another one as well but usually we

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:18,190
also go back because if you cannot you

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,140
if you don't improve here all the posts

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,710
you are going to be hit by the

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:26,820
competition or somebody else is gonna

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,560
come up or so long as mark

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,060
they're going to say okay your content

00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,820
is not good enough anymore so this is

00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,010
why we always dedicate resources to

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,250
research all the work costs and to fix

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,390
them so we have a checklist

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,100
there's not many people way to stay

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,450
consistent and not everybody knows

00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,000
what's happening for all the things

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,850
mentioned so far we have procedures

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,610
written down so even if you come today

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:55,590
company can really not very fast well

00:30:50,610 --> 00:31:00,000
how it happens so management system as

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:02,520
well content management sheets so we

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,550
have this kind of mastership where we

00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,090
keep everything so we deposit or future

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,770
doctors well again we have our calendar

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,980
with talking something or topics but we

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:16,890
are going to edit in the future we also

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,720
keep track of our few stops there and

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,580
what we're missing and what we are not

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,500
in a Content depository of all the blog

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,220
post we have already been published so

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:29,310
we can find them easy because the things

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,620
that tell the traffic it one wanted to

00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,500
get in some things post with keywords

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,230
here translating needs somehow keep

00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,880
everybody on the same page which is the

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,330
thing move ourselves everybody

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,760
is that if you're going baby you have to

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:47,490
have a clear idea what happened while

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,230
it's happening because as we mentioned

00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,780
earlier we have to cut like 90% of

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,400
competitors painful to be reducing

00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,030
there's no point if that happened

00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,450
anymore

00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:00,180
yeah yeah and finally we have it all

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:03,030
nice built up in this fantastic Academy

00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,860
this is this is the internal website for

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,500
us just to keep it easy for every weight

00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,480
that is already in the company or is

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,140
changing the department or is just

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:17,760
coming and to work with us so we have

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:20,100
this religion or mourning process of

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,390
course but we keep all the documents and

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,790
check

00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:25,270
in one place because as I mentioned if

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,100
we have 20 people do the same thing

00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,920
that's only for like informational

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,830
content or SEO and we have a bunch of

00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,210
our departments and at one point the

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,670
company realized that we need to

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,590
centralize information in now how it

00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,870
guides its tips and that's what a

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,870
fantastic Academy is a very real project

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,790
but it's already working

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,910
it's getting better but it's proven to

00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:52,970
cut the patent information on who what

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:55,670
where why I said simple but it takes a

00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:58,190
lot of the communication from tens of

00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:01,550
people just a bit about on the same page

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:04,640
and once solved a problem never curse

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:07,550
again it's a popular research or

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,160
keywords of just how to get a procedure

00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:13,730
with service department that will help

00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,610
this issue path of metro tens of times

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:23,030
wasting power cell hours and now that's

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:53,930
really saving us a lot of nerves all

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:56,090
right we kind of get into this situation

00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,670
where we started to work on the books

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,250
and the or nominal subdomain and there

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:05,890
was not resources for that at the moment

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,890
to kind of bring in too many kind

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,849
well we generally yes yeah generally yes

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:17,639
but our most obsessive focus on a

00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:19,919
subdirectory so it really depends

00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,560
after sometimes we go catches up it's a

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,819
big sense yeah cuz honestly our domain

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,790
is really big and we're constantly

00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:28,409
pumping it up with ninjas if your own

00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:31,349
small domain is better to be on the

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:35,429
subdirectory and that's tasted before we

00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:38,399
got big we saw those blocks under the

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,159
subject we did were working better than

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,740
the disciplining but for now or just

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,649
were stuck to this that makes it work

00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:56,909
the internal links saw Google did catch

00:34:46,649 --> 00:35:01,589
up if you can afford it and website page

00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:07,079
or the sewer rewards so you can get two

00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:09,780
results that can seventh and then be up

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,050
in heaven again and at one point we had

00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,470
the first two results we put a lot of

00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,109
attention to the content when me

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:21,010
actually it's all farts were good for us

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:23,020
because we have it all like results so I

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:33,220
know what you mean in terms of problem

00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:36,040
but work for us implemented in all cases

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,160
the best Caritas subdirectory and as

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,590
mentioned earlier we are slowly

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,490
migrating content that's worked and seen

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:47,740
cleaning or pest control as shown under

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,650
an example of the books were migrating

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:59,470
it other pages settlement pages so it's

00:35:50,650 --> 00:36:01,840
an asylum thank you and yes so where the

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:04,540
trafficking for free without using

00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,210
Google Earth sorry for go to Google

00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,619
penguin and all the wonders decreasing

00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:15,099
winds

00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:17,950
well actually basically if you're blame

00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:19,570
of really good organic strategy and if

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:24,430
you are really voted keyword research

00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:30,070
and content production you might not

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:33,040
even need that means to run because well

00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:35,200
you already know which our websites are

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,930
and you probably have access to

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,170
different tools and if you're gonna

00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:43,420
check them out you're not gonna find a

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,890
lot of links because we are not still

00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,780
betting on the box we are actually

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:50,230
betting more of the content strategy so

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,730
even without all the backlinks and I'm

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,520
talking about

00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,740
penguin especially eating spam that

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,230
means most its ability to compare to

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,560
links there's a lot of ups and downs but

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,060
we wouldn't we didn't just not do bad

00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,040
things because we were afraid of penguin

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,210
we didn't do them because we saw that we

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,130
don't actually need to allocate

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,260
resources for that because you are

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:25,800
managing to run without reference on the

00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:30,270
big topics only property researcher I

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:40,080
often do write articles and how long are

00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:41,910
they in terms of words all right now

00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,070
because we are white a team of five

00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,920
people that are producing articles

00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:51,119
regularly we publish at least two per

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,100
week but before we get experience with

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,410
completely different kinds of schedules

00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,800
we even post it once a month sometimes

00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:01,680
on the some of the books that we have we

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,890
posted twice a month we cost it daily

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,680
and what we saw is that whenever posting

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:10,920
data we don't really have the time to go

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,020
deep into the topic so this was kind of

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,700
quite a condition for us this is why we

00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,130
decided to post at least two times per

00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,960
week so that we have enough time to do

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,320
it but even when you're posting monthly

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,170
and you're what it's sometime like when

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:29,040
you build up at least a few topics then

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:31,109
you can if again if you look at content

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,360
research then you can avoid yourself

00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:38,080
post not so often so

00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:40,390
yummy and when it comes to the length it

00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,280
really depends on what the user is going

00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,170
to be status right from we mentioned

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,410
briefly the searches in them so

00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:49,060
basically if if I'm looking forward if

00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,920
I'm searching for something like how

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,320
entire time I'm not gonna write the

00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,020
5,000 vertical bar compile-time

00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:59,530
but if I'm going to write some about

00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,960
some medical issues or sighing and yeah

00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,460
while the electric cooler which Cap'n

00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,040
they don't have to go in a little bit

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,930
more detail so it really depends on how

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,340
much the users one of the suspects

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,200
automatic answer would be that we have

00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,930
an article it's very sharp and it's

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,540
bringing thousands in traffic and if the

00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,310
really depends on the quay of some as he

00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:22,870
mentioned we don't mean factors in the

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,380
worst issue of see result for Boers do

00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,930
it depends

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,000
that's why we look at the Serbs and when

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,130
we're done researching when you look at

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,170
the Sun and it grows all the results and

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:36,060
you get familiar with the topic we're

00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:40,840
gonna figure out how much it's all about

00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:44,080
also depends on our own knowledge so we

00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,810
also draw more score on departments our

00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,310
own experience so if we know something

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:55,050
that we can't we have to say for this

00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:55,050
panel which is waiting for us

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:08,359
have you ever deleted and both of Boston

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:20,930
honor to have every distant outpost in

00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:23,060
order to clean yes yes yes it's an

00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,579
arguable question even been rocking

00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:29,030
before for anything but we didn't get

00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:31,940
any traffic from them for the past year

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,050
we were looking at that how how much

00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,609
traffic you are getting from those

00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:38,359
articles and if we get the link back

00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:39,740
links to those articles so sometimes

00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,990
when we have a lot of bad things but we

00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:46,210
don't get the traffic we could blue 301

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:51,440
redirect something that is useful but it

00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:54,170
depends doesn't matter in all kinds of

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,910
lack because in the history so in our

00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,890
case if you don't matter at all

00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,260
we actually got positive results from

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,490
cutting the content but we also get to

00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,780
replace it with something that is

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,490
actually running so yeah basically we

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,829
did not have any problems but we have to

00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,109
write more and better in order to get

00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:13,579
results

00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:15,500
well that's sometimes I just really it

00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:18,950
was just to get the links I gather some

00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,900
things perfect Boston area water because

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,690
getting links for service pages is

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,210
counting sometimes just get what you

00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:30,170
need so you can there's a bit of space

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:33,880
you can both get what I mean - it

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,880
depends on what's at stake

00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:42,860
are you for or against buying paintings

00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,590
well we don't need to buy with the

00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:48,170
rabble's natal watchin it gets up gets

00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,810
us some of the things we're buying them

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:56,680
but the industry is blooming there

00:41:50,810 --> 00:42:01,430
versus actions actions and our markets

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,890
markets doing that so if you can't don't

00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,930
have the time know how to build things

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:09,860
you can always buy a kiss we don't give

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:12,130
the budget rather invest in something

00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,130
else

00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:24,620
can you go back briefly back to the

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,260
poster concept of the key words it's not

00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,600
necessary to be on the computer you said

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:33,170
when you folks you want to raise one

00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:37,010
keyword right a lot of blog posts with

00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,690
related content and see that the answer

00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:42,500
to the question is and something with a

00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:46,640
counter top corner I think it was a

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:49,550
nasty September and if you really want

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,940
topical databases like many dots that

00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,700
Google is connecting in it's AI figuring

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:59,600
out which dog four days to which dog and

00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:02,410
the idea is that if you have one general

00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:07,520
topic rats from the channel let's say

00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:10,190
something Instagram marketing and the

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,490
idea is that you know not going to write

00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,290
everything you know in a single article

00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:17,390
absolutely

00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:19,970
and just cut it in different pieces that

00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,180
the Google spiders got to see imagine it

00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:26,300
as a weapon so the mother is being

00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,180
supported for being pointed from winning

00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,480
tournaments yes

00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:35,840
for example you can marketing you can go

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:40,100
down to tips pool their Instagram

00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:43,190
pictures some others some doctors five

00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,160
minutes ago you can go deep into several

00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:48,730
others of the same is the silo structure

00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,200
but within weeks you know the silo

00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,780
pretty much the same as the same when

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,990
you hear the mother of dr. King because

00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:00,020
we are not always sure if we should

00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,940
build such a structure we just go flat

00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,800
see what works you're relying on

00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,330
internal links and when we get the

00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,080
results we just kind of migrate to

00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:10,400
graduate blend much content can help

00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,140
there's already lots of resources on the

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,920
web about even Buster's you can also

00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:19,640
state the mr. cup spoke this is another

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,380
term so you can google for more

00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,850
information in you can see ourselves if

00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,200
that's actually going to work for you

00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:28,940
because it's not the one-size-fits-all

00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,560
model of course so you just have to

00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,720
figure it out for step two does gonna be

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,720
useful for you for us across useful

00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,920
that's an answer the question

00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:44,270
I mean if you mention that because of

00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:48,050
copyright issues you have to kill two

00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:50,870
domains yes yeah today ask you that or

00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:53,260
couldn't you just delete those pages the

00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,260
decisions

00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:59,470
the thing was that when it comes to

00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,690
copyright issues about images they kept

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,369
up history so they seem that you're

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:05,470
wrong you've already been using it for

00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:07,180
quite a while and they're going to say

00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:11,020
no matter that you can relate in it you

00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:13,569
still have to pay us so it because when

00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,700
I be confident with momentum we cannot

00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:17,920
escape I guess if you're a smaller

00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,020
website you could just capture the

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,579
project can vanish but we couldn't

00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:25,960
really escape from the situation that

00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:27,970
they has and decisional got from our

00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,559
legal department was that I think they

00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,770
had some causation or something like

00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,500
that

00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:34,680
yeah and the result just it skidded when

00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,559
for some time and then our Directorate

00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:41,940
which you can do so we can list a wide

00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:56,230
open domain but yeah we have to

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:58,319
sacrifice Thanks anybody else well thank

00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,319
