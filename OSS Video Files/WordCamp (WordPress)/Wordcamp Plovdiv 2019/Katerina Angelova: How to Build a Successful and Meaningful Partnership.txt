Title: Katerina Angelova: How to Build a Successful and Meaningful Partnership
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: Wordcamp Plovdiv 2019
Description: 
	The WordPress community is built on human relationships. In the context of business, nothing that lasts was ever built by a single person. In the same way people connect with other people and develop networks, small companies can interact with larger organisations in a strategic way to build strong mutually beneficial partnerships. Creating these relations requires time, effort and understanding. However a lot of people struggle when it comes to contacting, developing and creating a connection with other entrepreneurs or large companies. Thankfully, there are steps you can follow to approach a potential partner and write enticing emails and proposals that will immediately get their attention and bring you the desired results. As a Partnerships Manager at SiteGround, I develop relations like these and I will share practical tips and guidelines to help you express the benefits of a mutual partnership and expand them into a successful collaboration.

well hi everyone thank you very much for

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,880
being here this is my first time

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,250
speaking in your area and also my second

00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,840
time at work um so I'm very excited to

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:23,750
be here with all of you I need to see

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,199
some familiar faces here but for those

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,289
of you who don't know my name is Benina

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,719
I work at a big spider out fengyi now

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:36,670
Sairam is a web hosting company

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,430
we don't sell socks as very big meeting

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,430
we are in the market with 15 years now

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:51,200
and it's an independently owned company

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:53,090
and I started four years ago in customer

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,129
care because to show me that office was

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,370
great because of the moment I was living

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,860
there and later on I moved back to

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,949
Bulgaria and started working in our

00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:07,009
village partnerships team in Sofia where

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,649
our headquarters offices because we

00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:13,219
don't miss them when I still to best

00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:15,740
hopefully it's to connect with people

00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:18,639
and establish meaningful relationships

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,009
so this is basically my talk right now

00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:25,549
every day I look for new opportunities I

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,499
find new partners and I also help with

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,770
organization of already established

00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:33,259
homes and this is this has been a very

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,259
long and exciting journey for me because

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:39,289
Sai Ram is the place where you learn you

00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:43,099
grow but also most people will challenge

00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:47,119
yourself every single day so the topic

00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:49,729
of my presentation means how to many

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,950
partnerships in business and the first

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,359
question you need to ask yourself will

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:59,149
be - why does my business need a

00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,849
partnership and does my business needs

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,630
or needs one and there is a simple

00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:08,030
answer which is yes because a successful

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,819
partnership will help your business grow

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,390
and we hope your business expand in a

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:17,540
way that you do

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,489
say if you know that once once you

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,069
create a business it's because you want

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,739
to run some revenue and everybody of 30

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,480
or even and this is what you good

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:33,980
Ornish's and recently I was in Italy

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:39,110
refers on my place and you know whenever

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:41,690
it is the answer which got me thinking

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,140
about something about an example for

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,319
this presentation so just imagine that

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,819
you're an artisan and you sell all types

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,440
of pasta yourself you see a macaroni

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,989
really all the paths that you can

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,930
imagine you love it if you do it with

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,359
your heart and everybody loves it

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,670
because it's crafted is homemade is just

00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:08,209
fantastic and people come to your

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,269
specific shop just because of it but

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:14,329
what happens when your clients come to

00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:17,209
you comes to you and they ask you ok I

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:20,510
found pasta bowl do you have tomato

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,730
sauce and then you know that there's

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:28,280
something is missing and then we have an

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:30,470
opportunity to to create more revenue by

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,129
adding in product that you don't have to

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,750
do expertise to produce and this is when

00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,930
you know that you have to find somebody

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,840
for that but what it actually takes to

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:49,400
find someone I'm sure in the next slides

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:52,250
so I have a simple recipe which consists

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,329
of two ingredients and the first one

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,489
will be to find a mutual business

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,430
benefit you need to find something that

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:03,199
is very good for both sides because this

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:10,069
is how you can create a win-win

00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:11,629
situation so you sell your pasta but

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:15,349
follow

00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:18,530
sales tomato sauce and below just like

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,940
you shares your values and he loves his

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,700
to do things

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,030
homemade he he crafts his own tomato

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,030
sauce

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,950
but the when at the moment when you

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:38,790
offer to follow to sell his sauce new

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:41,460
shop this is an obvious benefit for him

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,790
because he just might look like he's

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,950
supposed to be read by more people and

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,920
the second thing in this and second

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:53,060
ingredient my recipe would be to add a

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,760
spoonful of human and personal touch

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,980
because below not only shares your

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,190
visions about business and how to do it

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,020
but he also loves football games and

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,570
you've seen him to go to the same

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,420
stadium substitute and you wonder why

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,180
this is valuable information well it is

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,340
because this is something small that is

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,800
very human and very dear to both of you

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,620
and also gives your ground to start the

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,820
conversation further bulletins and

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,340
sharing of the Society's video any of

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,100
the slide says simple recipe but

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,200
actually these ingredients take a lot of

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,930
effort and business mission

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,340
understanding and in the comments likes

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,840
and share with you my personal

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,200
partnership process and my beliefs

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,780
altered the ways to increase your

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:51,090
success chances of ancient steps of the

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:53,910
process so identify six steps which are

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,270
to divide the partner define the profile

00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,150
of the partner to research them approach

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:06,380
them convinced deliver to the partner

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:11,040
and then make in their relationship so

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,910
the first it will get to define who will

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,630
be a possible party and this is somebody

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:21,600
who has to have who can help you achieve

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,110
your goal but also have a need of his

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:33,060
own that your organization can fulfill

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:35,430
and for example on daily basis now it

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,790
worth it a lot of web page

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,890
and designers who happen to have clients

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,740
who are constantly looking for quality

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,600
hosting accommodations and this creates

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,650
a perfect opportunity for us which is

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:54,770
why were fortunate our affiliate because

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:58,080
then we have a different situation first

00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:01,590
these agencies they get Commission's

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,200
forever in their estimate of us second

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:09,270
we have access to their client space and

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,920
dirt actually we hear is that the

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,260
clients are finding happy and satisfied

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:20,280
because they were looking for a quality

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:26,270
hosting and last but not least you need

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:32,400
to remember that sorry

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:34,590
services it needs to be someone that you

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,780
need to remember the other human part

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:41,420
here because it needs to be someone that

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,420
you're feeling comfortable working with

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,440
the next step would be to research the

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,110
business and people this is important

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,850
because the more you know about the

00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,990
business of that organization that you

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,510
like the profile that you found anyway

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,550
and we know about them meaning about the

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,860
history of the business their virus and

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,840
also what kind of clients they have we

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:15,510
will increase your chances of closing a

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:18,240
deal with them and when it comes to the

00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:21,750
people you need to find the right person

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:27,240
to contact you cannot choose shoot for

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:29,640
the HR and or someone that has nothing

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,340
to do with your business goal you need

00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,340
to find the correct person to contact so

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,130
to be able to establish a real

00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:40,140
conversation and for the relationship

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,610
for example inside around 10 years ago

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,250
when continuity

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,680
technology became popular we started

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,649
looking for our new ships and we really

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,850
liked welfare and we started researching

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:57,810
that company and then we identified the

00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:02,260
head of their business development and

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:05,410
it turned out that this woman was also

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,320
from Bulgaria and that's one side of

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,839
this Bulgarian company so the good thing

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,459
was the books and truly valuable thing

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,550
about this piece of information that we

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,410
found is that this actually gives the

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,269
grounds for that unique connection and

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:25,240
establishing a conversation with this

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:28,329
person and starting the whole process so

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,089
the next step would be to approach that

00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:33,850
person once you have identified who's

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,579
the right one you can do it in many ways

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,510
the most professional way would be to do

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:43,149
it by mail but unfortunately their

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,209
emails not everyone replies to them in

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:49,029
time things get delayed and this also

00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:51,940
happens with social media like LinkedIn

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,850
and Twitter which is why advanced light

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,520
workouts are fantastic because you can

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,470
lean people directly you can go much

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,450
faster you connect easier

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,360
someone can introduce you to someone

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:09,880
else and the best part about the

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:13,240
workouts and similar events is that you

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,640
can research them initially and you can

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,649
research who will be there and you can

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,380
approach them directly but also these

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:23,560
people can introduce you to someone else

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,570
and even if you don't have a basis or

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,339
ground for a mutual project at the

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,399
moment that doesn't mean that in the

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,829
future they might they will won't

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,140
remember you or won't consider you about

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:38,800
some other project or one refer you to

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:44,320
some models and there is another secret

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,029
about these events and this is the fact

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,180
that a lot of the people who are a lot

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:52,060
of the families that come here or

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,940
and other where comes go along and

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,550
believe me all these people will be true

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,850
to have someone that is genuinely

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:04,290
interesting what they do and what their

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,780
job or just to meet some new people

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:11,140
so don't miss the opportunity to talk to

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:14,830
people or talk to anyone that you having

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,200
you think will be interesting because

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,870
people will also love to talk about

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,930
themselves and you never know what can

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,930
happen

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:32,020
the fourth step after you don't know the

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,590
job tip here will be to convince them so

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:38,080
once you once you found the right

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,630
contact and you have approached them you

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,280
need to be very specific with what you

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,620
want from them you need to tell them

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,520
exactly what you want and what they can

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,550
expect don't tell these people what you

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,470
think they might want here it doesn't

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,600
work like that because people who don't

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,370
have time for novels especially when it

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,410
comes to email or Internet communication

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:06,070
this will show that you value their time

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:08,320
with your specific and concise also we

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,540
need to show when you convince someone

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,030
you need to show that you have a good

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,300
understanding of what they do because

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:19,210
this shows seriousness respect and also

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,890
it shows to that person that you're

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,680
talking to that they're important for

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:28,300
you and they'll appreciate it

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:34,120
and sometimes we will receive requests

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:36,250
or which basically say hey we love side

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,310
round let's do something together in

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:43,330
your life okay but you're telling me

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:45,340
that it's nice that you appreciate that

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,440
company and what we do but tell me

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,830
exactly what you want because right now

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,690
I see that you don't have a plan and

00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,040
it's not really good because I really

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,650
don't know what to expect from you

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,420
either and then there's the other

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,680
example with the agencies for example

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,960
that come to us and say do we have

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,620
we have a lot of clients we're from

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,050
super fast Alec lastly support I hear

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,660
your is excellent and this is where I

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,910
know that this person comes with an idea

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,540
and knows what he's looking for and I

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:23,520
also know what I can offer to them and

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:26,010
last from this part it's also really

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,440
important to stay flexible and be open

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:32,220
for new ideas because during

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,320
communication and this may change the

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,690
entire concept of a partnership can

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,000
change and you shouldn't close your

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,190
doors if the initial project doesn't

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,550
work out because better solutions can

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,550
come on

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:51,320
so now that we have a view there are two

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:57,300
more steps between final steps and are

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:59,580
probably the most important ones and one

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,540
of them will be to deliver what is

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:06,170
promised to keep your promise in from

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,690
the agreement and to make things happen

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,250
because if you remember Apollo we were

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:15,270
afraid that you go to a football game

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,320
streets who sells pasta who says tomato

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:21,420
sauce you promise to him that you can

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,850
order table here they put it in your

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,010
fine shop in the middle of it so you can

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,800
give him premium exposure but you forgot

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:34,620
to earlier table and you postponed it

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:39,060
with a week and follow is built

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,680
irritated now and what happens when the

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,020
next week you don't find the time to

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,740
order you to spawn it with another link

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:50,460
and Paolo gets knotted in frustrated but

00:14:46,740 --> 00:15:00,740
very disappointed and he he has all the

00:14:50,460 --> 00:15:03,600
rights to be disappointed so because

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,690
you're not only showing that you don't

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:11,220
keep your promise and you don't deliver

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,990
what's your grade forum already produce

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,410
that extra home

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,350
exquisite sauce for you the one that you

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,100
wanted so badly and this sauce will go

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,740
to waste and this is the moment when all

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,260
of your initial effort all of the effort

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,959
in putting this initial steps goes

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,029
absolutely place because this is the

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,990
moment when you lose trust in this

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:40,320
person and this is very important and

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,970
you should remember it is because when

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,620
you keep your promises and when you

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,010
deliver what you will create in first

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,250
place this is when you tell this person

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,770
I am committed or retailer partner and I

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,410
have committed to this business I want

00:15:52,770 --> 00:16:00,300
to work together with you and an image

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,580
is born and what happens then one day in

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,100
the future I will have a friend that

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,740
sells pesto and she tell them about you

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,839
and then when you repeat the entire

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,060
process and you keep your promises to

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:17,670
this new person your business will

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:22,079
expand in a more and the last and final

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,560
step from my personal approach and

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,750
process will be to maintain the

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,120
relationship with these people if this

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,420
is essential because many people made a

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,240
mistake to think that once a partnership

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,029
is established that sales yet it will

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,540
evolve along and this is really wrong

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:45,380
because you shouldn't let it grow

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,240
stagnant you should not let it grow cold

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:51,600
you need to continue communicating with

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,770
follow and your other partners you need

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,810
to make sure that he stays with you you

00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,970
need to make sure that he's of David too

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:02,970
many organizational were development

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,179
changing that for business my experience

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,600
you need to also think of a clearly

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,089
business point of view just to improve

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,130
that partnership it doesn't have to

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,500
always stay as it was a great in first

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,490
place you can make promotions you can

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,410
change things you can add more products

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,600
just things a way to make things better

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,200
for you for him and for your clients

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:32,720
after all that's why your business will

00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:36,500
be rolling and to summarize on what it

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,350
takes to many business partners I can

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,180
only speak from experience but during

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,480
the last years I've worked with many

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,260
people from different countries and I

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,500
learned one thing and this is that no

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:55,460
matter what doing the steering there are

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,140
two essential things to build a

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,490
meaningful synergy among entrepreneurs

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:04,730
and there to have a winning situation

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:07,130
and also for both parties to trust each

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:40,150
other and you were the one that lays the

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:50,840
foundation so how do you target people

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:53,390
they have to go to companies yeah well

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,030
it's it really depends what your

00:18:53,390 --> 00:19:01,360
business is about but for example now we

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:04,070
what I do is I look for agencies

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,520
referral agencies or web designers or

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,250
bloggers and I research I mean internet

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,990
because it's an online world the one

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:17,060
we're working and that's why when I

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,610
mentioned that is important to define a

00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,250
partner you have to meet up here at your

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,160
pool beautifully because as mentioned

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:29,180
with the agencies do you have plenty of

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,660
agencies they're great but for example

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,690
if they work with asp.net

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,090
even if the agency's fantastic it's of

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,460
no use for me or from our clients

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:49,480
because we don't work for the same

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:52,510
services thank you i as well say I am

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,870
cobbler and I'm a chemist about staining

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:58,120
that and I team up with who provides the

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,850
tomato sauce but then I decided that I

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,310
always want to team up with a Liverpool

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,110
has the best burger Chung and my clients

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,650
are very happy so I go down that

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,140
slippery slope and I team up with

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:14,620
someone else who offers most uh hello we

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,470
have to house offers basil pesto and in

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,300
the end of the day I have so many

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:24,340
partnerships to handle I don't really

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:26,140
have time to paint the pasta my question

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,760
is you know this is a lot of use

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,160
containers for our business do you have

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,790
any tips for having that for sort of

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:38,170
like streamlining the lurch reasons of

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:41,410
these partnerships yeah if you if you

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,240
first business route with the tomato

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:50,590
sauce and any which is a very with the

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:52,330
pesto and then find it it will be much

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,850
easier for you because you've got more

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,370
partners you can assemble products more

00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,280
clients will come to you and you have a

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,740
lot more revenue diminishing so you can

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,350
also hire more people we don't need to

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,650
be on their own I mean and it's good and

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:12,010
this is good it's good to delegate teams

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,820
to other people to trust other people to

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,820
end our work day

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:46,119
I see you just a moment

00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:48,039
so you said when you attack it is

00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:55,509
already the company owes back to teach

00:21:48,039 --> 00:22:03,959
the delegator it was just the example

00:21:55,509 --> 00:22:06,639
because for example you need to find the

00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:10,119
first you need to have a clear business

00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:11,709
goal for your for your own business it

00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,559
doesn't mean that if you conduct the

00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:17,700
technicals for a chair or someone else

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,669
from that particular company won't be

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:25,450
valuable or won't be actually the right

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:28,869
person but normally when it comes to

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,719
small businesses there or larger

00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:33,849
businesses they had they have their

00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:35,649
different types of departments so if you

00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:39,039
want to do something which is strictly

00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:41,919
technical you cannot really maybe

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,829
further actually you can go through a

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,109
chart is this person could also refer it

00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:49,029
to someone else or to forward your

00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,609
communication and introduce you to that

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:55,089
the right person for you it shows that

00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:57,009
you need to find the one which is really

00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:59,769
strictly related to what you actually

00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,149
want to achieve because if you were if

00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:04,869
you were and I don't know what you what

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:07,599
do you do or why do you have a mind

00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:09,489
right now for for business or who to

00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,469
contact but you should do something

00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:13,929
strictly technical it's always better to

00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:16,869
that's maybe the kids of business

00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:21,539
development of that department or if you

00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:25,179
do if you are researching something

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:32,700
related to human rights business then go

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:35,679
for the HR so basic exactly yeah exactly

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,270
you just need to have your first to

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,510
clear your ideas

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,210
and then define your business goals and

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,550
then define who is actually a good fit

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,690
for your company and then you can find

00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,830
the right person in their business okay

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:58,540
thanks

00:23:50,830 --> 00:24:01,480
thank you so is it defensive before you

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:07,240
go straight turn for example if I start

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,000
goods but my partner's putting over

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,610
losing something it's not a fanciful

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,560
like you you should draw the line when

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,380
it doesn't mean work when it doesn't

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,510
mean if it's a fancy for you if it's too

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,180
much hassle for you if things get really

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,220
difficult and you don't see a value in

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,460
it or you're still having constraints

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:32,800
too much energy for you you you should

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:35,500
be able to tell let's just keep making

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,090
the proponents stop the communication

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,650
here I don't think I don't need

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:44,410
expensive I've had to deal with clients

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:47,200
like that partners like that at some

00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,630
points you just have to draw a line

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,210
because if you don't see future together

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:56,160
and if things are becoming difficult

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:59,800
from the beginning or at some point and

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,860
both sides can overcome them it's just

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,280
better to go separate ways so we should

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,050
double over the door well it really

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,750
depends what you're looking for if you

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,370
give me like sound like a real-life

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,000
situation maybe I can give you more

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:19,800
accurate advice use innocent

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,600
moments even when things get difficult

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,420
that doesn't mean that you cannot

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,230
overcome them it depends so in how you

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,030
see things

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:35,350
because sometimes painting that's it I'm

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:38,290
done I can't do more I'm tired and then

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,940
you keep going because you know what's

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,640
your ankle and you know what you want to

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:46,750
achieve so you don't stop here and you

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,560
don't stop over it okay more changing

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,810
terms

00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,730
it really really depends on the

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,540
situation

00:25:50,730 --> 00:26:01,710
okay like aging if you have a example

00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:01,710
that's natural ask us we can't after it

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:30,340
would be a conflict of interest that's a

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:36,420
bazooka and Tara logic hosting company

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,420
and also no more government interests

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:46,780
very it can be at some point but on the

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:49,540
other hand it could also not be and now

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,530
tell me why I think so and this is

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,410
because the rental what here we offer

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,960
like services because there are many

00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,860
hosting companies out there and each

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,530
company offers their own type of vision

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,160
of the services of their values of their

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,400
passions

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,650
not everyone there there just give a

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,020
more clear example you have cheap

00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:20,020
hosting services year average prices

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:22,750
then you have extremely extremely

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,630
expensive hosting solutions and this is

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:29,350
perfect because not everyone looks for

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:31,480
type a favor time skill there will be

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:34,300
people that will look for your types of

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,860
services there and you can refer to

00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,530
other people that come to you and say

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,420
hey I am happy with your service but I

00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,240
also need this for a separate project

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,930
and then you say ok folks or go

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,440
somewhere else

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:51,370
this is this is the good thing about the

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,260
variety of the market and and that there

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,460
are so many companies out there because

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,289
there are things per annum

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,260
services for everyone their solutions

00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:03,679
for a woman and not alone the same thing

00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:07,570
everybody wants the same things down

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,570
below if I answer your question okay

00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:34,179
[Music]

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:34,179
okay presentations

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:59,980
well I'm not sure this is information

00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,980
that we should be revealing just because

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:11,990
it happens it has happened and I'm sure

00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:14,630
will happen in the future sometimes but

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:17,600
this is not something new

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,870
I don't think that you should focus a

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,929
lot on that unless it happens all the

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,970
time that you get denied like when and

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:32,270
when someone says you're over perfect

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:33,740
but if if you are denied or proposals

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,500
all the time then you should start

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,179
thinking of different strategy and you

00:29:36,500 --> 00:30:04,970
should start thinking of different way

00:29:38,179 --> 00:30:07,940
to communicate things maybe files though

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,700
one of the things that a lot of people

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,789
do

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,340
is to not know what they come from and

00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:18,840
they don't have an idea what they want

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,309
from us and they just say hey let's do

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,350
something together I know you're a big

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,149
company let's do something together and

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:27,899
you're like okay but what do you want to

00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:28,619
do we need to know what you exactly want

00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,159
from us

00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:36,059
do you want us or do you want to refer

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,629
your clients to us you want to to place

00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,580
your for example if you have team shop

00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:45,809
if you want to place it in our

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:47,639
marketplace stuff like that ladies this

00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:53,700
is maybe one of the business days that

00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:56,309
people do this is why is also important

00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,470
to do your research do your homework to

00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:01,499
have a good understanding of what that

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,989
company that you're looking for has to

00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:06,720
offer as well and what what kind of

00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:09,480
clients they have what was their

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:15,509
business values their history it's just

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:17,549
anything that can reveal anything that

00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:19,379
can reveal information which will be

00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:24,720
valuable for you what make that

00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:26,489
composure it's it's this is probably one

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:33,419
of the biggest mistakes that people do

00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:37,399
not know something else the other other

00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:42,919
other mistake that I can think of maybe

00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:48,869
the way of communicating things because

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:56,220
when you when you use super fancy words

00:31:48,869 --> 00:32:00,509
and especially when you use like nobody

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:03,899
uses nobody understands me more it is a

00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:05,519
it's over it's like it's too much and

00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:07,470
people don't have time to read that

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,350
because at the end you read the whole

00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:14,340
sentence or email and don't even know

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:17,429
what where's the focus so it's important

00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,840
to be precise and to say what exactly

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:26,370
want when you cannot

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,370
people should expect just be clear on it

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:39,450
that's okay we're out of time

00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,450
register thank you so much

00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,619
