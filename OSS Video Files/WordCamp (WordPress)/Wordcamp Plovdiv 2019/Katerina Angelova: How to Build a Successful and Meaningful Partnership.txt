Description: 
	The WordPress community is built on human relationships. In the context of business, nothing that lasts was ever built by a single person. In the same way people connect with other people and develop networks, small companies can interact with larger organisations in a strategic way to build strong mutually beneficial partnerships. Creating these relations requires time, effort and understanding. However a lot of people struggle when it comes to contacting, developing and creating a connection with other entrepreneurs or large companies. Thankfully, there are steps you can follow to approach a potential partner and write enticing emails and proposals that will immediately get their attention and bring you the desired results. As a Partnerships Manager at SiteGround, I develop relations like these and I will share practical tips and guidelines to help you express the benefits of a mutual partnership and expand them into a successful collaboration.
