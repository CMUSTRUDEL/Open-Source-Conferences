Title: Sjardo Janssen: How I Taught Myself Front-end Development
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: Wordcamp Plovdiv 2019
Description: 
	Teaching yourself how to code is difficult. Even today, after working as a professional front-end developer for 6 years, I’m still struggling to keep up to be able to create what I want. In this talk, let me take you by the hand and give you insight into how I took my first steps as a front-end developer. Starting off with HTML and CSS, 15 years ago, using Microsoft Frontpage. Upon today where I’m teaching myself React to build Gutenberg blocks. During this journey, I will show you how and where you can start off to become a front-end developer. I will talk about recreating examples, where to find the information you need and why asking questions can save you dozens of hours!

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,430
to be a really interesting are we from

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,470
the developer at years have come or at

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,009
yours I built a website geo to come I'm

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,259
also the product owner and yeah I really

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:30,030
want to talk about how I taught myself

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:33,060
for content development and I will give

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,500
you some lessons in how I did that so

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,110
first up we know framesets that's not a

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,220
lot of people framesets were the cove

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,899
each website started with that was 2002

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,670
they were awesome they were really

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,310
awesome and really easy to build

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,670
websites websites into eternity with

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,439
something around this it was easy or

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,649
flat or as mental

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,210
there are my old website from 2002 but

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,090
it's gonna find it anymore so editing my

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,070
hardest broke or removed it but it's so

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,740
yeah it was interesting times we I

00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,070
created every website I made in front

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,010
page anyone knows front page well

00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,050
community focus yeah have a market

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,390
we had a great UI and that was my first

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,510
experience with with building websites

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,430
using the UI I don't think anyone ever

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,370
said yes from time development

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,319
I've wrote down a dip in the HTML I said

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,930
floated right and it actually floated on

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,430
the right side that never ever happened

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:40,849
so well in 2002 I build my first website

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,410
it was for my family my dad come from a

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,420
big family and they want to show off all

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,379
the pictures of all the left or all

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,510
their meetings and that was very well

00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:54,440
and do what you are you can do lots of

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:57,410
cool stuff like this one we nursed mark

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,060
you yeah that's awesome

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,680
I try to movie and slide it in but it

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,290
didn't work and in the end we're running

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,780
a PDF so it will work anyway but yeah

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:13,670
wanted for the work you is awesome it

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:16,340
still gets it still valid and instead

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,629
use it some sometimes to debug and all

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,569
that kind of stuff so I know where

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:23,660
something happens but is it though that

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:26,599
was awesome and but I was kind of done

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,720
with with all the Yui stuff we are in

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,790
front page so we have to move on and the

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,480
only thing you can move on if you not

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:39,130
only uses the user interface he start

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,630
copy and pasting and copy of facing is

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,859
perfectly fine when you're a new

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:48,049
developer if you have stepped over flow

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,829
copy paste every thing that's

00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:51,560
awesome

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,780
well if not there's no no one emphasized

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,310
yeah it's like a flow the story will

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,139
work yeah if you have a big project that

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,819
probably won't work but if you have a

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,680
small product you knew and you just

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,910
needed your cursor that bursts out

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,099
fireworks or something

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,919
use that overflow or something like that

00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:10,400
they have the answer and four new new

00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:13,250
people small issues started starting

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,769
issues it's perfectly fine but please

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,849
please copy/paste everything when you

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:23,120
knew but that also means because it's

00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:24,830
that overflow you break everything or

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,280
twice or like ten times

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,440
so please back up frequently I made my

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,480
website like ten

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,570
because everything broke thanks to stack

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:39,490
overflow in 2007 I was an intern at Bay

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,220
Bay web added a small company in the

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,050
Netherlands it was located in a barn

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,560
chickens running everywhere they're like

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,290
10 employees and during the interfere

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,910
internship already learned to talk to

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,740
customers and all that kind of stuff

00:04:51,910 --> 00:05:01,330
but we made our first websites and we

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:03,100
did up with this we had a table three

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,880
columns middle column had a set width

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,310
and that's your basic of the most simple

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,260
way of centering your website and this

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,140
was completely valid

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,440
back in 2013 via website it was not

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,120
pretty

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,720
we know there are gifts but this was way

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:24,190
faster this is actually the way I've

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:28,200
built my first around 75 websites so

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,930
that goes yeah that goes a long way but

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,380
the reason I created 50 75 website in

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:39,820
just six months it's because I repeated

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,990
myself safety for 50 to 75 times every

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,200
time I did it again

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,870
I knew more I knew every little bit that

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,660
could go wrong and in this way you know

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,770
every little part of your code so please

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,660
if you new to front-end development

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,330
recreate over reproduce after Greek

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,400
repeats yourself try to do within lots

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,690
of weight because that's the only way

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,940
you learn and grow as a developer so

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,340
where am I haven't I'm running to slide

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,630
to the same time really interesting but

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,919
into something when the tables are done

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,780
that's the only thing we did that

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,600
company because that generated most

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,640
money it's four hours it could complete

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,850
a new website for a simple simple

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,500
business what if you're boring so I need

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,020
a new stuff anything you need to be

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,160
enthusiastic again so in this way I

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,650
started to reproduce and recreate

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,440
everything I saw on one if I saw a new

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,450
layout at the new are try to recreate it

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,090
if I saw some animation are try to

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,320
recreate

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,330
this is an easy way of learning new

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,790
things what you have to be open-minded

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,860
you have to look further than what you

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,010
know already if you know everything

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:58,160
about HTML CSS try a little bit J

00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:04,630
JavaScript to make it to make sure you

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,630
know more code where am I

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:13,400
in 2012 I was another intern at a

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,960
different company and a lot of

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:21,830
internships 5 and 0 and this was website

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,850
of that company it was a webshop selling

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,380
kids toys but we also on the side sells

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,229
some adult toys if you know what I mean

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:35,479
it was really interesting if you see all

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:38,600
those orders coming in and then it will

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,760
of used lots of websites we build lots

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,070
of water who built a wall with Joomla

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,710
and that's something you don't want to

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,590
hear around here and at WordPress

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,289
community but Yoona is was pretty good

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,830
at that that time it was really easy

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,900
easy easy to to to quickly develop

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,760
simple websites and process so it was

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:05,500
open source is were cheap and it does

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:08,060
the job so yeah there was my way of

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,780
increasing my knowledge through other

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,600
open-source platforms but my mentor he

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,120
saw yep he are really good at building

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,700
websites which he have no clue

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,830
what to you does you have no clue how

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,910
analytics work all that stuff I had no

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,200
clue from so he showed me everything he

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,389
showed me analytics he showed me you

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,580
issue me how conversion works

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:36,050
what is a CDN how do you increase heart

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:38,539
speed how to minify CSS file and why and

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,690
these are all kinds of things you also

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:45,529
have to learn as a front-end developer

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,029
it's not just HTML CSF or your phone or

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,900
your little bit of code where you're

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:53,090
into your it's a whole unit that you

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,850
have to learn because

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:59,180
in the end he you have to look on beyond

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,910
your code you're the lost love lost line

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,410
of defense when you're chasing a button

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,230
over here you get a new design you can

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,540
implement a new button why and and a

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,850
button is a little bigger do you simply

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,660
implement this button on the first ask

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,880
is this correct in the whole website the

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,089
building is 40 pixels high now we're

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,730
making one of 50 pizza instead it said

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:26,390
it said accidentally it has a purpose if

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:30,050
so why is that on purpose you should ask

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:32,570
more than only the things you you're

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,460
building and working fine you have to

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:44,480
look around to be more more open let me

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:49,490
see where I am in 2013 my last

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,610
internship I promise I started that they

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,860
were at a small agency and also in the

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,589
Netherlands of course and it was a web

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,310
site back then I were a closer or CMS it

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:03,170
was visual basics or only there's HTML

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,050
CSS feature Beijing way too hard for me

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,190
I have no clue what they doing but we

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:14,600
are creative and lots of people in the

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:16,250
company and we had some SEO people we

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,839
had some content marketers with some

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,900
brand marketers when you ate some

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,240
artists we did a shitload of work for we

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,080
also drank a shared love of alcohol the

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:33,380
parties were really amazing and then sir

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:35,270
at one moment something popped up this

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,720
administrators transferred from Saudi

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,730
Arabia asked us to build us a website of

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,010
building a website the problem was that

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:47,150
website had to be in WordPress

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:49,390
at that point and never touch any PHP

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,959
and I've touched WordPress website

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:56,120
so as a wise developer I say well I

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,000
would love to make this website we can't

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,370
do it in WordPress I never was simply

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,230
told me well we have a problem I already

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,440
accepted the project and it has to be

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:13,879
done by Saturday and it's what you say

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:16,610
so s+ panicking bring hot and yeah we

00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:23,389
had we have to go but we have to do but

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:25,759
yeah no clue of how I should do that so

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,139
I had to knew how I could find my

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:32,180
information and that's not something

00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:35,779
like going to the actual documentation

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,970
from WordPress what is also learn how or

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:43,370
what are the synonyms for some kind of

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:44,629
words Wow how can you whatever how do

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,189
you pronounce it in English if you're

00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:49,180
Bulgarian and that your native language

00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:51,259
and you never said anything in English

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,579
that language has a shitload of

00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:58,670
documentation my own language Dutch has

00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:02,209
none so I had to learn English from

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,910
forever for everything I do but also you

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,889
need to learn how to people learning to

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,920
viewers actually your thing you can just

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,709
you can simply write up whatever you

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,649
want and search there are lots of it's

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:17,870
also relaxed engine search engine bug

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:21,860
these days where you can really specify

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:25,819
what you looking for in a manner what is

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:29,750
what what what I manage it Stack

00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:32,720
Overflow I mentioned save my day I I

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,519
think 80 percent of the whole web server

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,709
Stack Overflow copies and it worked yeah

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:43,490
and I didn't knew how to debug or

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:44,870
anything but a it works but it also

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,970
showed me that I'm not the first one

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,680
with a problem I definitely how to

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,750
implement a menu in WordPress

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,339
so I good how to implement menu and I

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,829
have like a thousand results how to

00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,149
implement a simple work Tasmania when

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:58,160
you are new to front-end development

00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,100
you're not a person experience problems

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,399
you're not working on complex systems

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,649
that nobody has ever seen or code bases

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,699
that is so bad you you don't even wrap

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:13,870
your head around it when you knew

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:15,900
everybody has done this already just

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,350
google it

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,150
you search for it it's important to know

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:26,370
that you're not the first one with that

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:29,280
problem so in 2016 same company three

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,680
years later I was a team lead as we call

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:38,090
them team captain I really hated that

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:41,040
net term and every website we built I

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:44,160
yeah I was the boss I had said yeah

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,540
that's good that's fine and yeah really

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,640
nice spot and if we didn't like

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,150
something I could say now it we

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,170
won't do that

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,960
and we did today was there was

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,510
interesting times and the company grew

00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,540
where the basic team that we set up for

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:05,070
each website and the production speed it

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:07,980
up but also projects were getting bigger

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,810
and one of the problems we had is that

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,750
we were selling websites between ten and

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,680
twenty five thousand euros we definitely

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,880
do backups we didn't do further control

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,820
with just that they are with

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,790
your life and that's really great if you

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,460
want you can move fast and break things

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,140
what is not if you're you're investing

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,990
your your your company and your time and

00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,730
really valuable projects I don't want to

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,290
be responsible website to break down

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,800
because I have to do something live

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,410
because we don't want to or make sure

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,720
we're running a stage stage version for

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:48,480
website it's not it not something that

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,860
happens at a company and yeah it was

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,930
hard for me because I really loved that

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,430
company and and I want to move for a

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,710
move further I want to help them grow

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,140
and got bigger but it just didn't happen

00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:02,490
I waited a year talking one person

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,320
didn't happen so it changed jobs and I

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,200
could tell you if you knew and you think

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,170
yeah I come down anywhere anything from

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,080
from from this spot at this moment

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,060
change your job because changing your

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,560
job can give you new insights can give

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,150
you new visions of how to do things

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,040
you've talked to new people you get new

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,950
opportunities you're not stopping the

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,720
same rhythm as every other day you have

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,129
new challenges please guys change

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:37,389
when you have to when you think you're

00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:40,750
stuck so in 2007 team I was 27 years old

00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:43,839
at that moment I had a little brother

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,560
jr. and yours is a pretty well-known

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:52,240
company or nervous the first day even

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:56,740
more nervous than I am now and there was

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,350
a little kid 20 21 years old and he

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,319
showed me around set of my working

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:05,740
environment because there was mandatory

00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:09,730
for for the company he said of get he

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,230
said we yarn he said up we working Kabam

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,699
we're doing things on the command line

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,019
and never touched freaking come online

00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:19,269
dating it's scary

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:22,629
well he did that all those things for me

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,639
and one point is something and he said

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,920
no no I'm not the right person to answer

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,879
dev go to that guy he knows way more

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,939
about that structure and because he said

00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:38,129
that he reminded me that you don't know

00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:41,470
you do not need to know everything about

00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:44,079
your field when you're a developer you

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,329
don't need to know every language you

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:52,059
don't need to know every little bit of

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:55,000
PHP it's just simply not possible but he

00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:58,089
knew exactly the persons were experts at

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,129
those moments when you need something

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:01,569
for something particular he knew who the

00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,819
expert what and he moved to them he

00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:07,799
redirected the question just to make

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:12,309
sure the quality was always always great

00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:15,600
and I was just I kept from 20 years old

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:19,990
learn hear from you fresh out of school

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,209
but when you adjust you sometimes see

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,760
people running around and now hey that's

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,199
a familiar face that guy has a huge

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,990
following based on Twitter or something

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,830
and that's scary and for me that's

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,890
really scary

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,770
I'm a big infrared I find it really

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,799
really scary to stand from lots of

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,330
people argue guys sending in a great ho

00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,000

people people run around and it I always

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,370
looked up to people with a high status

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,580
or more knowledge one yeah I should

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:03,960
listen to them because they're better

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:05,490
but that's not true it's it's it's it's

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,230
not valid everybody it's the same as

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,390
running as shoes have the same values

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,779
but in WordPress

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,380
especially the WordPress community

00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:15,690
everyone is pretty equal at least we try

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,220
to be equal you just have to talk on

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,399
Alexander he pointed out some great

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,010
things but everyone here wants to help

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:29,070
and wants to help you progress and come

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:31,740
and help you move forward so please ask

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:35,309
questions if you're in community if you

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:39,120
have questions about about how something

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,799
works as community go and Twitter tweet

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,269
out something is someone important and

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:47,610
probably he will answer your questions

00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:50,299
most of us are developers and I think

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,740
all of us are passionate about our work

00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:55,350
our developers just want to talk about

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:59,850
what we do what we love anything

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,380
everybody likes that you like horses you

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,679
properly talk about horses

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,419
please don't to be I hate horses but if

social media I was hoping that it would

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,059
stretch a little longer about how to

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,669
know second reef so it was a tiny bit

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,899
short but I hope you enjoyed it and if

00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,990

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:55,789
I want something feel really anxious

00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:58,700
right now hi thank you for a talk that's

00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:01,070
nice and it created other people start

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,440
up some kind of the same place as I did

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,230
so I have a bit of a controversial

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,809
question she did you started what I

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:12,320
would consider the original front end

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,570
because yes what I've found in recent

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,909
years is you know when what do you think

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,679
about the phenomenon where now if we say

00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:20,870
we search for a front end person

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,600
it turns down it turns out that they're

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,789
searching for jobs to developer so how

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,539
you know that that question how do we

00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:32,210
now discriminate between html/css

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,130
development and doing layouts in the

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,200
visual part which was considered to be

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,450
the front end and JavaScript development

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,250
which is I would say a development where

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,559
a lot of logic is moved to the front end

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,830
so how do we you know define how those

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,179
new categories I'd say I think this is a

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,400
really good question when I when I'm

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,740
moving jobs that was one of the parts

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,840
are I really had a really struggle with

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,090
I was a firm that developer that there

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:02,480
was no function I thought I was I was

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:06,470
looking up all the what he called for

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,110
cathedrals in the Netherlands job

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,610
descriptions tanked campus and what I

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,770
was looking at job situation everybody

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,270
what was he asking me I do we know react

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,919
for like five years so that's not

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,590
possible but hey you're still asking it

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,650
and although that comes up props often

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:25,159
and JavaScript and I was like but that

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:29,240
is that front end fragmented there is

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,679
your question I don't I don't I do think

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,400
it from that in front of a magnet but

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:37,820
you have to divide that between really

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,350
good HTML really good accessible HTML

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:44,570
and and CSS and and I have separate

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,830
JavaScript people but you have to know

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,960
the basics of each other

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,960
you always need neat basis over here

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,389
because you have to when you build a

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,190
little

00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:56,099
website and she has to write coach you

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,749
have to know the people who will work

00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:01,799
with you colonel and you have to know

00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:04,219
what you going to do if you have to you

00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:09,049
have to combine those powers and I think

00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:12,029
if you'll in for a specialization and

00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,739
above that some manager has a general

00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:16,169
overview of all the kinds of things but

00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:19,079
if the amount on work for you here if

00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:22,259
you have specializations like one girl

00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:25,529
HTML CSS and one coach JavaScript one

00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:28,649
goes react for Africa I don't know

00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:35,190
what's out there anymore I think there's

00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:37,200
more supporting hi hi there hi my name

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,509
is Maria a software engineer at

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,779
automatic thank you for the great talk I

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:45,479
really really enjoy it I was curious

00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:49,409
about whether do you think that

00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:52,529
WordPress has helped you be a better

00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,209
developer and do you think that you

00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:58,499
would have been as good as you are now

00:22:54,209 --> 00:23:01,109
if WordPress hasn't been there thank you

00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:02,879
for the question its I absolutely think

00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:04,750
thanks to WordPress I'm a better

00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:06,469
developer right now

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,200
[Music]

00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:13,320
it helped me evolve and made me gave me

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,839
possibilities to do so side projects

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,879
with the word WordPress before I were

00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,070
working with a closed system I couldn't

00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:22,349
work it outside of the outside of the

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,749
office but so I could never make a

00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:28,879
website for for friends or family and

00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:32,399
now I can and I can play around 24/7 and

00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:33,570
just increasing my knowledge and that

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:36,329
was not possible before

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,759
and thanks to WordPress day and with all

00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:41,940
the documentation there is it's way

00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,349
easier to learn and to find your

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,469
information and that that's really

00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:49,440
important that we should well from the

00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:53,519
funny thing last couple months ago at

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,589
working with Gutenberg and that's a real

00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,819
pain in the ass if you're not into

00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:01,619
JavaScript Jeff you have what is it and

00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,700
I was looking at the documentation and

00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:06,360
what horrible

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,970
I was I was like how can i how can I do

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,410
it I can no no no longer copy paste it

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,380
into my project because I have to

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:16,860
install yes six next or all Afghan stuff

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,830
like we're stepping back again we had

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,720
greater accumulation in explaining

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,990
everything with all great code snippets

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,330
and now we're going back to random

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:31,380
content explaining something that you

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:33,150
don't understand and yeah and that was

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,210
really good with web workers and we

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:40,170
should and she'll protect that thank you

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:42,320
oh damn question thank you and one in

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,320
the middle

00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:00,330
have you experienced a situation when

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:05,490
somebody for example a client was not as

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:08,880
satisfied from your website you created

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,380
and if yes how you reacted what was your

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,950
like could you repeat the question

00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,000
please

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:17,250
hey have you experienced a situation

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,840
when a client was not satisfied from the

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:24,480
website you created of course of course

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,290
I think I think most of you people are

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,240
pretty fun if you show them the phone

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,160
number final sorry but you always have

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,190
some people that dislike what you did

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,490
but most of the time that's something

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,660
that goes wrong in the process so when

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,400
you're talking to them and you have a

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:46,200
feeling you understand what they want

00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:48,360
please confirm that make notes during

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,490
conversations and make sure they

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,590
validate that those notes so you're on

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,240
the same page when you create the design

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,050
for a check the design before you

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,480
implement it all the old etc it's more

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,750
processing or one that's happened and

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,110
not so much your website suck one

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:10,550
everything was great so I hope that

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,550
answers your question thank you

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:20,400

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,400
