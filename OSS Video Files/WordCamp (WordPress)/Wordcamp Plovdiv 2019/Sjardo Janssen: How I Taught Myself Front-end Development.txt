Description: 
	Teaching yourself how to code is difficult. Even today, after working as a professional front-end developer for 6 years, I’m still struggling to keep up to be able to create what I want. In this talk, let me take you by the hand and give you insight into how I took my first steps as a front-end developer. Starting off with HTML and CSS, 15 years ago, using Microsoft Frontpage. Upon today where I’m teaching myself React to build Gutenberg blocks. During this journey, I will show you how and where you can start off to become a front-end developer. I will talk about recreating examples, where to find the information you need and why asking questions can save you dozens of hours!
