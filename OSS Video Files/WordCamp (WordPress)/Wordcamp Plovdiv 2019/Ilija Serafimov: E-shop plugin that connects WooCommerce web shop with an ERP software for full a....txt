Balkans invent another hot water that

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:56,970
got me thinking it it he was right it it

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,920
wasn't very creative from from me from

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,980
from us

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,840
thing to do in the next cup of it that

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:09,630
was 2008 in the next couple of years

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,400
started the the tornado of of websites

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,140
every company in Macedonia was wanting a

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,130
website they were building they were

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:25,800
getting their first websites it was the

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:31,200
area of HTML without CSS so you can

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:35,360
imagine the options that we had to to be

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:40,130
creative we had the Microsoft front-page

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,530
2003 like an environment for for

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:49,410
developing websites and we were very

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:53,250
happy when Macromedia was was launching

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:57,390
their dead their solution the

00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,810
Dreamweaver also I remember the the

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,030
flesh the flesh was very popular a tool

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,910
for develop for animations for

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,700
developing website every company

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,080
Macedonia was wanting the upgrade from

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:16,400
HTML

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:21,509
or PHP to refresh we were working very

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,879
much on the on the websites the the

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:27,120
software the the software development

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:30,599
even even came speeds at one time

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,050
because on the first place on the very

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:37,650
first place were the websites the the

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,289
web development the web design the the

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,539
second place we started because we saw

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,259
an opportunity we start working with

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:49,020
domains and hosting because we started

00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,719
make packages we saw opportunity here

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,710
because we were selling a lot of

00:05:51,719 --> 00:06:00,719
websites and why to pay some other other

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:05,789
provider etc and the structure came came

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:15,620
third our our biggest love our reason to

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:24,289
to start an IT business over the years

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:30,479
we started to a knowledge that the

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:34,860
e-commerce is starting to to take a

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,979
great part on the market now the the

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:42,150
regular websites the clients were

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:46,139
calling us to transform them into web

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,719
shops maybe not at first title

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:53,879
functional web shops but at least

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:57,770
catalog web shops not to buy the product

00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:01,229
but to have all the products divided by

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:05,250
categories subcategories and so the

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:07,889
people can click it read the

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:13,259
specifications the description saw the

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:18,420
price and then if they wanted to buy to

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:23,530
call the office in 2012

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:29,140
we we started to deal with that we start

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:36,030
to to develop customized solutions we

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,030
started to develop for our own CMS and

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:48,310
in 2012 we meet met the the wordpress it

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:52,000
was I always like to joke about it it

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:56,620
was a love at first sight when I show

00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,880
what the WordPress can do it was amazing

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:04,180
I had heard about it before but I didn't

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:10,210
pay attention I had a couple of projects

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:13,360
that were done in Joomla and that was it

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,400
I was always reading about WordPress I

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,280
was reading about Drupal I was reading

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:23,170
about all the others who were trying to

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:26,250
get their fair share on the market we

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:31,270
started to look at the at the WordPress

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:35,350
that was a time when our colleague blog

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,170
way join us at the company he came very

00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,910
fresh with the ideas and the love for

00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:47,080
WordPress and we started to developing

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:50,110
web shops teams and of course we started

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:58,810
to combine them with the plugin the

00:08:50,110 --> 00:09:04,290
commerce wordpress site cannot be web

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:10,180
shop without the double comments plugin

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:16,560
we started to to offer this new power

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:16,560
our idea on the market and

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:30,689
we started to to see that there are

00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:37,279
there were some not solved problems at

00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:42,509
the companies they were afraid of the

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:46,199
double tasks that will that will come up

00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:52,559
for them they were they were afraid that

00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:58,079
the person who is entering everyday the

00:09:52,559 --> 00:10:02,240
data in the ERP software it will need to

00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:08,339
enter the data in the webshop and

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:15,420
backwards all the cells and orders from

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:19,079
the webshop it may need to be put it in

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:31,220
the earpiece software so the so the

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:36,760
stock match and I'm clicking

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,760
I think the presentation is going

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,110
[Music]

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:11,819
right where were we they got the part we

00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,819
got the part

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,330
yeah these are the numbers that

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,320
impressed us that the development the

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:41,820
growth of e-commerce in the in in Europe

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:45,690
we were we were following it very

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,630
closely 30 years this is the this is

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:52,560
exactly right like it was from 2012

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:56,130
until today and these are the numbers in

00:11:52,560 --> 00:12:00,570
Macedonia so they were also getting very

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:06,660
very big very impressive from one year

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:10,140
to another this is in 2018 Macedonia as

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:15,620
a country their citizens had the growth

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:18,660
of nearly 70 percent in just one year

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:23,610
because the people were not we're not

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,410
feeling safe with the with the payment

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,200
cards with the debit cards or credit

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,960
cards or or whatever they were not

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:36,000
feeling safe with the delivery and that

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:40,350
is an issue that is that is smaller and

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,060
smaller with with the time so this is

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:53,090
one one proof that in in 2008 the

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:53,090
numbers are by 70% better than in 2017 I

00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,400
was talking about the problem that we

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:05,160
get we noticed the problem was two tasks

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:08,820
for one person or hiring another person

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,140
just for taking care of the webshop the

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:18,810
companies were not very happy about that

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:22,760
we will have had cases like one very big

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:27,900
company in Macedonia Skopje a bookstore

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:31,120
a network or franchise of bookstores all

00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:33,120
honest donia with

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,740
thousands of thousands of products

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:41,320
products and when we came by one day and

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:47,380
we asked them how are you satisfied with

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:50,680
your webshop they say that then you we

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,900
are we are very busy our our colleagues

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,750
are killed every day with putting

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:59,670
products they are making mistakes our

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:05,830
stocks are not are not synchronized and

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:08,500
such and we we acknowledge that the

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:16,360
there is a problem that nobody is

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:21,220
solving it at at the moment so we made a

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,980
research at first we already love the

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,600
word press the word press was getting

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,680
bigger and bigger I'll come back to this

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,310
light was taking care of his market

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:39,540
share was expanding was conquering the

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:45,420
world and we had no doubt that the

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,420
solution it must be connected it must be

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:53,170
very close closely related with the word

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:58,470
press and with the WooCommerce that was

00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:02,070
our first conclusion and it was it was

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,070
no doubt about it

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:10,720
the other part was how to solve the LP

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:16,270
software the DLP softer part we cannot

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:22,020
make a solution a model or plugin that

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:25,600
is working with every LP ever so with

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:30,100
own research we saw that there is a

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,300
slovenian company called data lab that

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:38,250
is also comparing the market in 11

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:42,620
countries in Europe including Macedonia

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:46,590
including Bulgaria and

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:49,530
we took this earpiece software we

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:57,410
started to use it for our personal use

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:57,410
for our company and then we started to

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:08,190
developing the model the ship model for

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:11,250
all the Pantone software Pantheon

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:14,430
software the Pantheon software is

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,980
available in 11 countries Bulgaria

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,190
Bosnia Herzegovina Montenegro Croatia

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,640
Macedonia Kosovo Romania Slovenia Serbia

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:27,060
crania and Slovakia it also has an

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,730
international interface on UK English

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,970
and us English that can be used by any

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,770
other country they are developing it in

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:41,610
opening offices in many other countries

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:44,160
in the moment it has fifty 7631 licensed

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,780
users at the moment this is fresh number

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,730
this is 15 minutes

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:54,390
I changed the number 15 minutes before

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:57,510
before I I entered here and it was no

00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:01,430
doubt about for us that we must figure

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:05,339
it out how to connect how to synchronize

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:13,890
the Pantone ERP software with the

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:19,230
WordPress Luca Mertz webshop so we

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:24,530
developed this module which is not only

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:29,640
only plugin it has another part it has a

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:33,990
desktop part that that launch the data

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,840
into the plugin that is that is

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:40,770
installed and configured

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:47,100
with the VUCA maths plugin and all that

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:52,080
is working perfectly all the data all

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:55,470
the necessary fields the image the

00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:02,700
feature image the attributes everything

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:09,690
is working perfectly and from now on the

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:16,470
Pantheon the Pantheon users can very

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:23,490
very easy migrate to WordPress if they

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:27,570
aren't already or also the WordPress

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:31,320
users can be great to Pantheon so we

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:35,270
made couple of solutions not only the

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,310
playing now we are offering the plugin

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:40,410

can ask a question that comes to my mind

00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:30,309
to break the ice

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,529
questions because it was a presentation

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,289
so you shared a lot of these sites about

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:37,269
Macedonia and how the penetration of

00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:43,830
those they must donate do you have any

00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:47,889
statistics about what area number of yes

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:53,169
yes but but you will forgive me because

00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:57,299
though those are unofficial we are from

00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:57,299
stream its extremities visits pound

00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:05,369
literally on the border with Bulgaria

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:10,330
the the municipality that that the that

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:13,509
we bought the tourist package so we

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,470
often came we are often coming to to

00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:21,759
Bulgaria for many reasons for for

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:25,320
shopping for for everything and

00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,970
sometimes for no reasons at all

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,830
tetrax and dance keyboard well great and

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:40,919
Sofia are very familiar to to us and the

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:40,919
first thing that I as an IT student I

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:50,590
saw in Bulgaria it was 18 2006 2007

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:56,039
Macedonia was not having a single rep

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:58,419
shop the Macedonian banks were not

00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,289
offering that they didn't have the

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:05,740
service like superior classes or

00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,490
whatever they did they were not offering

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,250
good

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,770
the service of e-commerce so you can

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:16,270
connect with them you can open a bank

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:20,350
account or sub accounts and and stuff

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:24,600
like this that the only company the

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:28,660
threat of webshop in in Macedonia was

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:32,710
Deutsche Telekom and their web shop was

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,860
hosted in Germany so it was the only one

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:40,150
so they start making commercials they

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:43,540
start making marketing by OTT if you buy

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,910
the mobile phone from the from the web

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:50,800
shop it will be it will be free delivery

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:53,260
10% less and nobody was doing that

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,590
nobody was knowing how to do it nobody

00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:00,880
was trusting it and and and stuff in

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:07,140
Bulgaria I joke about this until today I

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:14,620
joke about this 13 years I was saying in

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:18,790
Bulgaria that is Meera's the kiosk

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:21,040
traffic they have their shops haha how

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:26,410
is it possible everything is online

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:32,200
everything is they do everything even

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:39,010
even if I even piracy the movie is very

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:40,600
popular in Macedonia and I didn't know

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,240
how how we are not how we are not

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,130
tracking this now how is how is like we

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,890
when we were crossing the border we're

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:52,420
going into another planet of off right

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:56,290
and I was very nervous about it so this

00:22:52,420 --> 00:23:00,430
process in Macedonia took took a lot of

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:02,170
years even 2012 when we met WordPress

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:06,490
and WooCommerce and we start build web

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:14,410

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:17,400
with they were offering us on every

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,860

pay the bank about 25 euros a month

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,309
provision if you want they don't care if

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,890
you want to have zero transactions and

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:41,730
they were taking from five to seven

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:46,110
percent from transactions they didn't

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:49,530

government's in Bulgaria it's not so

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:49,710

the system collapse

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:59,430
no one could use it the companies we

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:07,320
were we needed to generate this number

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:10,950
that we now we must put the the value in

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:16,890
total so the Ministry of Finance will

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:18,750
will transfer the money away or a

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:24,030

00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:39,420
monthly payments for us in the company

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,430
everybody the the manual Cohen nobody

00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:45,810
knows where it is the software is

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:48,150
collapsing people getting fired actually

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:53,070
nobody get fired I don't know why you

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:56,880
know nobody nobody's these brains then

00:26:53,070 --> 00:27:00,260
that's that's bad nobody's taking

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,260
consequences yes

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,679
[Music]

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:29,850
to fully automate and optimize to work

00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:29,850
between the shop you mean problems

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:40,600
difficult in this exact case with this

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:42,850
shop yes damage the future image we

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,710
couldn't solve that in the in the

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:48,970
Pantheon database

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:52,720
there are encrypted in some way that

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,929
only they know so until we crack it we

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,850
had a problem for synchronizing for

00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:00,279
transferring the image all the data no

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:04,889
problem all the fields even the custom

00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:07,110
fields no problem in the future image we

00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:10,059
kill herself

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:16,090
yeah thank you

00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:31,180
I think we have time for one or two more

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:34,420
questions of the piece and thanks

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,400
other presentation if Eliza's also

00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,970
getting super excited or yuppie last

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,670
year and I was looking into hoodoo or

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:44,470
formerly open-air P and as we know

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,070
there's like lots of software already

00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,920
out there

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,600
that solves the thing so clearly I

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,090
talked to somebody who's actually doing

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,820
implementations for them and he said

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,800
don't do it because the problem is not

00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,890
software it's actually the adoption of

00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,920
the users who use the software in the

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:07,330
end so implementing yuppies like really

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:09,070
really big do the so is your process now

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,950
to actually leverage the customer base

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:14,170
from Tennessee on and you can focus on

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,690
the on making the WooCommerce solution

00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,740
for them this is like did this make your

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,710
life a lot easier

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,210
would you recommend this as a learning

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,590
also from saying you don't need to

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:30,550
create everything yourself because it's

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,610
very hard not creating everything by

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,380
yourself it may be the most valuable

00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:40,660
lesson that I've learned in my in my

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:43,570
life my almost 11 years of of experience

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:51,040
in the not only the IT field in the in

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:55,150
the in the business field at all when I

00:29:51,040 --> 00:30:01,170
think you all will agree with me when

00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:05,520
the when the CMS's were coming out

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:07,930
everybody was talking bad about them

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,830
that they're not perfect that they're

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:16,780
not protected enough that the clients

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,970
were the clients were saying what is

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,630
this this is a WordPress you took this

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,680
from the internet it's it's all already

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,240
done and you want

00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,790
to pay me for something that you only

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:35,640
took from internet and put it into my

00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:40,870
service and they were not understanding

00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:45,760
but but it was like a two or three years

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:48,460
process where the the WordPress started

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,150
to be to be knowledged

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:56,190
like something very normal like

00:30:52,150 --> 00:31:04,800
something like something default because

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:07,390
it everyone that is smart enough so that

00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,990
the website that we are building where

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:13,990
the webshop is like they told us to so

00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:17,560
it cannot be taken from Internet and

00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:21,580
just just put it on don't just just

00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:23,590
launch it and then when they were giving

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,420
fear you know let's put it this here

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,550
that let's put it like this I don't like

00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,280
it like this I want more options these

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:32,800
options I don't want and when they show

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,650
that we are developing for them that

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,770
they were they were fine also they saw

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:43,140
that there is one price for WordPress

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:47,800
and boo comments and everything that is

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:52,200
content management based and that is

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:57,840
definitely very very different price

00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:01,300
when someone wants fully custom herbal

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:07,150
solution for four-day for their problems

00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:12,550
or ideas and I was very happy happy with

00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:14,860
that because I think by the end of the

00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:18,430
day the most important thing is solving

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:23,530
the problem finding the solution it

00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:28,330
doesn't matter if you find it something

00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:32,690
that someone already found it all you

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:37,730
you will be trying to find it yourself

00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:41,870
so that's a very long time longer time

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:46,670
for you for the client more money for

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:50,330
the client or or less for you if the

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:57,950
client does not accept your your time

00:32:50,330 --> 00:33:00,980
building and and such so it's very very

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,540
important for me it's like I said it's

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,880
one of the most valuable

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:10,280
well maybe the most valuable lesson that

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:14,630
I've that I've learned but also I'm not

00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:16,580
I'm not 100% sure how it works in

00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:21,350
Bulgaria but in Macedonia there is a

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:24,560
lack of creativity every every IT

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:27,860
engineer that is that is coming out from

00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:31,610
the from the faculty is looking for a

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:36,050
job there okay and now I'm now I'm a

00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:40,430
bachelor and I need someone to to hire

00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:43,220
me and when you hire them they say okay

00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:45,560
now give me something to work or I will

00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,800
sit like this all day

00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:55,250
and with with just a little bit of

00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:57,050
creativity we were finding solutions

00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,450
that they're not they're not that that

00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:03,560
hard we're fixing a hole in the market

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:08,540
and maybe maybe we we fix hole in the 11

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:11,120
countries with wait with this it was not

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,340
correct because you go on everything in

00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,550
a company you say hi We're from Serafino

00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:19,220
group we're here to offer your webshop

00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,200
they say a webshop is a great idea it's

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,169
a great tool no doubt about it but who's

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,700
gonna who's gonna taking care of it

00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:29,060
who's going to support it who's gonna do

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,050
the data entry that's a another job for

00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,650

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:37,850
another open jar for me or some thunder

00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:41,690
from the staff I should put them more

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:45,310
hours to do to do this and it's it's not

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:47,510
not good idea at the moment for me and

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:50,690
now with this I think we're solving

00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:55,580
problems and for another colleagues even

00:34:50,690 --> 00:35:01,610
for the for the competition Thanks thank

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:04,940
you I like to ask is it hard to keep up

00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:08,990
with who commerce updates now in your

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,440
company I mean your product is mainly a

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:15,200
plug-in that you install in the

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,330
WordPress platform right yes so is it

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,910
hard to keep up with the constant

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:26,780
ecommerce updates or is it not that

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:31,970
challenging it's not because they are

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:36,670
not the de Vaca max updates lately are

00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:41,680
not that general are not that that main

00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:45,440
so they can - took us from the tracks

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:52,760
the they are getting better they're

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:56,870
putting it something minor and our our

00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:00,140
interest is the big the big picture so

00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:03,140
the big picture is is okay at the moment

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,540
it's right on track right where we want

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,560
to be and of course in the future if you

00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:11,840
comets or WordPress decide to make some

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,020
general change some major improvements

00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:19,340
or changes or any care of course that we

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,990
will must sit down and and take care of

00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,610
it

00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:25,100
all right thanks and just one more short

00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,640
clears of course about the the business

00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,890
model of of your solution is it a like

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,330
on a subscription basis or one-time fee

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:39,740
how do you charge people for it it

00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:41,630
subscription think because anytime when

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,880
the when the client when the company

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,260
when the partners one they can just

00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:54,170
cancel it

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:56,360
alright thank you thank you I think it's

00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:00,400
just about time to close this session so

00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,400
