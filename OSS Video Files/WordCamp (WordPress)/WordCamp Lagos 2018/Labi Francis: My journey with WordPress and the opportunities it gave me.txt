00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,340
and and the opportunities given I'll be

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,949
sharing my story how I started in

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,580
WordPress and then how I went on to

00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:19,849
starting my own personal blog how I was

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,820
able to benefit from my own log I'm from

00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,949

one the lipstick okay my social media

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,699
handle that live in France is Twitter

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:50,440
Instagram all right like I said how to

00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:53,929
cover my personal stir into WordPress

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,239
why you need a personal website and I'll

00:00:53,929 --> 00:01:01,519
summarize my point and then you'll be

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:05,470
able to ask questions so in the

00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:11,870
beginning I I started with WordPress

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:13,760
2013 now it's in my 200 name a greater

00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,730
from the University of attack what I

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,670
studied gas engineering if always ask me

00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,610
what the relation between gas what do

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,740
you mean electrical and technology but I

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,380
discover that it's about passion and

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:32,240
what you enjoy doing so I I like to add

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:35,870
press 2013 menu or press 2018 a night on

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,080
my own but initially I paid someone to

00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,300
teach me so this guy I put in $5,000

00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,120
said he was going to teach me WordPress

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:48,110
and he does to me

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,690
put put your team I just write some text

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,730
via TV show me anything actually what I

00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,590
was curious enough hours willing to

00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,970
learn I went on to study on my own I

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,230
download a lot of materials and I

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,920
started building websites

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:07,130
look how boost for this work takes

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,979
everything I don't know cows doesn't

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,709
know one that's what's new my audience

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,019
let out a big Don T's okay isn't it look

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,439
I was meeting I was able to teach on my

00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:21,049
own laptop not taking it online so I

00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,730
practice on my own laptop that's house

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,689
equal to length I've downloaded

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:30,049
materials from from Google I stopped

00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:32,599
using the PDF query when I'm in PDF

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,010
Reader have said WordPress tutorial then

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,709
I put file path

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,530
PDF it helps me to get material so it is

00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,989
such and for something maybe a document

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,780
on how to learn anything I think that's

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,480
the best way to such it could protect me

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,999
to say file type and then put a column

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,849
then PDF brings up those materials for

00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:54,709
you so that's I got those materials and

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,689
I'll ain't ya

00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,969
and it was awesome I enjoyed every bit

00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:01,999
of it I was able to do a website on my

00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:07,579
laptop and I saw how awesome everything

00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:10,129
was then my first freelance job someone

00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:14,030
called me and said okay I need a new

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:16,240
website I needed to do a website for he

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,680
was into

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,760
processing visas admissions for schools

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,690
so I told you okay I could do that

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,540
website remember me who said any website

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,550
at all when I'm in host I mean for his

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,220
site to be like I want to be able to

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,820
access is all I need to travel any

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,190
process will use my laptop and then

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,740
practice so I took a leap and I told him

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:46,660
yes I could do it and then he gave me

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:52,420
the job I needed I think you paid me to

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,930
speak $70,000 I collected my nose I was

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,380
shocked

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,460
I like this is how I can make money with

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,170
WordPress does you know that I have and

00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,200
I finished the website for him

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:10,780
I showed him and he was happy with it

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:14,590
yet so becoming good with WordPress

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,410
I discovered that yes I could do his own

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,209
website what I needed to learn more so I

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,100
went to download more videos flooded

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,270
learn about plugins learn about

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,020
companies that would use to make your

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,570
website better editing CSS so for those

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,300
are not tech savvy CSS means cascading

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,820
style sheets we'd have to control the

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,290
presentation of your website meaning

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,170
your photo your font styles your phone

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,110
or it's the line height is PC with your

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,210
website so remember once we make an

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,540
installation of WordPress if you don't

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,050
know to control those colors you'll be

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:59,030
limited somehow so CSS helps you to do

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,970
that so I highlight CS

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,830
changed if I don't like it it seems on

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,630
your name on your website I could change

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,300
it and make it better

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,400
so the outside started getting better

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,820
with WordPress he was 13 during the

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,900
years I could do beta I would make what

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:22,400
present beta so you get the whole story

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:25,730
out at the end then a major opportunity

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,690
came for me I think this was really

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:32,210
transforming for for my life the

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,700
Commonwealth Games Federation that

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,530
Commonwealth Games Federation in the UK

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:43,220
they were looking for a web developer oh

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:46,490

corticoids and our swimming and attracts

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,050
that they were looking for a web site

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,540

commode information and the opportunity

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,630
was to walk in Lagos so I applied a code

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,300
WordPress that turns your WordPress site

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,270

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,530
month I said well it is how WordPress is

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:35,260
the community

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:38,080
this is so yes I went for your workshop

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,930
I came back two leaders I started my

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,180
work I send money to your website if you

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,690
know about Nigel Olympic Committee know

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,320
Nigel you've be committee in charge of

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:52,510
sports politics a mobile fields so I was

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,150
not managing the website I accessed

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,599
everything I met a lot of people and

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,760
make the minister of sports follow the

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:04,180
big big spots between position mental

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,240
trauma to give the chalk our does

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:10,270
everywhere the lad that taketh Attica

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,050
Attica and I will take you pass it to my

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,419
own estimate because when we wait to

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,400
really detect I should know front-end

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,070
development back-end

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,550
no a new program

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,320
which is PHP JavaScript you know all the

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,610
scaffolding but I just knew what press

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,900
them and a little bit of tricky no Amit

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,390
so that was it

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,240
and then I did my work well did you a

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:40,680
little got a website for them and I

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,050
watch movie so yeah traveling to South

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,990
Africa ambassador McCauley from the dog

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,800
shop I went to Kenya I went to boost

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:53,400
wanna I went to cook so it was really

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,690
also think that WordPress made all these

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,940
things possible

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,700
I tell you I would join everything

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,340
together for you to understand how you

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:07,290
really benefit from your knowledge of

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:11,490
WordPress so yeah that was me read

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,210
that's that I felt at that moment and

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,700
all this happened on Hawaii you know and

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,790
it was really it was really awesome so

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,150
yeah the first picture on your right

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,120
I pinned up with for me to be on my left

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:30,600
Jasmina South Africa and then the second

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,140
was in Rwanda that gigantic genocide

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,560
Memorial Center I paid a visit today to

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,470
that place to see people killed and all

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:46,040
the training the genocide then the last

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,040
one it's great man it's with the

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:52,690
development manager for mobile games

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:55,060

00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:06,460

00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:02,080
people to use it and then he said okay

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,360
and in Delta Africa all the offices in

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,360
African no nobody was using this

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,750
software so in a say that happen I went

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,560
to join I think about 17 or 16 countries

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,740
to do the training so Nyjah because of

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,820

out who hosts the server hosted training

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,830

anything from history let me start with

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,029
this so start in my personal note I

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:37,360
discovered that I had a lot of stories

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,790

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,649
kind of incident I know that I'm not

00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,440
alone all right yeah so we'd be like

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,899
sharing your stories on Facebook like

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,450
sharing your with Twitter and all so I

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,130
started my own personal blog like

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:58,420

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:12,390

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:32,949
personal website from your own

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:36,449
understanding but it's already no

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:36,449
concern me all right

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:54,040
half a packet so how many of us have a

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:55,150

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,350

everything easy if cannot do the local

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,640
installation I think there are other

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,730
workshops for that you could use

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,300

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,530
internet has made everything easy and

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,720
then he sent me about the Lindy request

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,750
and I was like ok let's let's be friends

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,800
we need to work on on something on me

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:23,780
and keep the rest building a personal

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:28,670
brand having your own personal website

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:30,800
helps you to use a personal brand then

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:35,420
adding value and influence in the

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:39,800
society there because this treats a very

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:42,320
big magazine said about Wanda you know

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,930
trying to create the impression that the

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,610
country was in the good country and all

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:53,440
so I replied with my own experience of

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:56,710
see this country of being there they

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,230
have free Wi-Fi on Geonosis but I

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:02,289
totally choked on TNT

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:06,039
when I attack people I saw like 10 about

00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:11,070
15 different ones to choose from and it

00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,070
was just awesome the adult on

00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:36,760
and it was like no they don't they don't

00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:40,000
want like this I just feel that you're

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,570
respected myself and it's okay alcohol

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,299
documents of the Romanians you know

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:49,000
cross the airport the airport experience

00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:53,080
the helmets we dare not move on tight

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,650
without your helmet on and Rwanda is

00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,920
also the second second

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:05,060
business in Africa yeah

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:08,090
Adam material but we can be done so

00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,400
after a this experiment I that was the

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,900
highest time I got the highest reviews

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,280
and got an order

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,250
so I assume with that I was able to

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,010
change people's perception about about

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:21,890
Africa especially the Western because

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,860
they didn't see that country as as

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:31,100
anything wrong the hottest world airline

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:33,830

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,350
those planes they have internet when you

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:45,740
won that and so I told them that you can

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:49,220
