my name is Carolyn Webber I'm SEO

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,150
specialist and digital marketing

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,980
consultant for small businesses in

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,789
Nigerian and today I'll be discussing

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:22,680
them I'll be showing you simple tactics

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,080
I used in helping clients to rank his

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,160
website his ecommerce website a brand

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,160
new website on the first page of Google

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,989
and WordPress using WordPress and

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:47,579
WooCommerce so let me jump because I

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:49,590
don't have much time but why use yfu the

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,489
need for SEO is because today's online

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,129
user is an informed buyer so before they

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,570
even come to you to buy your stuff or to

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,850
do business with you they've already

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,340
done their background checks on you

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,439
they've checked you we've checked out

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,960
your site they've also reviewed other

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,640
people's site on Google before deciding

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,900
okay maybe you're trustworthy enough

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,299
before me to buy from you also there are

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,030
two types of audience online on Google

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,150
using Google currently the first one is

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,350
the information seeker while the other

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,659
one is the buyer now these two people

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,650
have different mindsets when using

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,610
Google the information seeker knows he

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,049
has it in that he needs to solve and

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,820
he's looking for a process service

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,729
meaning that he's not ready to buy yet

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,520
but he just needs to find an information

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,100
maybe he wants to learn how to do stuff

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,399
so the kind of keywords they use on book

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,890
with usually what we a they use question

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:58,680
with what we have and why now for

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,430
instance I want to start importing goods

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,960
into Nigeria what are the list of fast

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,770
selling goods that I can import into

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,100
Nigeria

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,160
okay now let me ask

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:13,250
Google so he fights in the keyword

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,800
Vaseline it had lists of bustling goods

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,570
to imports or fastest selling products

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,130
in Nigeria Google shows in the relevant

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,200
websites and he clicks on needs to read

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,600
the articles is not ready to buy you

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,709
just want to get more information before

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,820
taking making the next decision now how

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:37,640
do you make this information seeker to

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,070
trust your website come to you read your

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,370
article and then go to the next stage

00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:46,400
either to do business with you what I

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,510
usually do is find topics that I love to

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:54,709
read and I use sites like Maryland

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:57,950
Maryland is very popular for three a

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,890
Nigerian school someone called it

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,500
Nigeria's ba Paulo we have to go to this

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,410
cost stuff so I'm gonna to abuse each

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,989
other but people couldn't ask questions

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,350
how can I do this where can i buy this

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,840
we can I lend this what connects on any

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,670
topic at all so they go there to ask

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,260
questions so this is the this is such

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,260
phrase I usually is when I want to

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,200
filter out questions from Maryland okay

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,180
to find out topics or questions people

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
are asking it doesn't matter how long

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,959
ago the act requested my matter whether

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,540
they asked the question five ten years

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,160
ago so long as it's still ranking on

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,560
Google duck was doing people are still

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,590
looking for answers to such questions so

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:48,340
now here's an example site : Maryland

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:52,640
dot-com space okay quotes how do I and

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:55,430
imports okay now I'll put put it in the

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,810
search box and Google will filter out

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,480
all the questions people are asking

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,720
about how do I import goods within the

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,760
comfort of my room how do I start

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,930
imported goods from China and all that

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,629
stuff so I'll click on the question

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:16,030
and then look at what this study

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:18,940
decomposition so if if there is no

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,370

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,220

decline to tell me these steps and I'll

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,639
go and write an article on it and

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,250

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,070

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,259
website where most of the articles on

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,720

blog or your website answers the

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,550
information seekers frequently ask

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,240
missiles right things like how-to

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:32,050
articles related to your niche what we

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,229
have why things like how much does it

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,430
cost to build a website that's a topic

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:39,580
that you can discuss these are questions

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,610
I asked what's being why they can so do

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,830
video series on your YouTube channel and

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,229
they can publish it on your blog you can

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,389
do case studies as well for depending on

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:54,400
your industry maybe you're the client

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:56,199
people need to see examples of clients

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,250
if helped anybody can write case studies

00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:03,630
reviews on your blog and you can start

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,250
ranked now the next person is the buyer

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,110
this person understand they have been

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,699
paying it keeps them up at night and

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,949
they need to solve the problem there to

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,790
make payments for that to solve that

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,650
problem and

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,790
kind of keywords they use on who is

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:22,240
usually price the fact is like price by

00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:25,270
best location so there are systems like

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,410
interior design schools near me or

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,810
interior design schools in Vegas Oh

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,800
price of what our closet so these are

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,380
the kind of questions because they

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,690
already they are a to make payments and

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,660
this the type of keywords that most

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:43,240
businesses or e-commerce sites like

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,070
targeting so they bring this bias -

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,470
really I want to become an interior

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,020
designer for instance where can I learn

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,400
interior design online how much will it

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,740
cost how do I register so you're dizzy

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,400
sad phrase the person fax it to Google

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:03,100
where can I learn interior design and

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,310
you make sure that your website answers

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,510
these buyers questions from the brand

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,070
name to the location to pricing time

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,510
reviews make sure you have all these

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,850
elements on your site reviews

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,850
testimonials features because it's one

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,380
thing to bring people to rank on Google

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,390
and then start driving to put your site

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,690
is also another thing to now convert

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,670
them into customers for them to not

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,380
trust you because if they visit your

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,480
site and they don't see what they need

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,540
they will just leave immediately and

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,280
that's what we call bounce rates so they

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,990
live in media and Google start having

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,820
this feeling that maybe your site is not

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,890
that relevant and your ranking drops so

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,740
make sure you have all these on your

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,780
site all these questions are answered on

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,250
your site so they can now take action

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,430
and also make it easy for them to

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,330
contact you put a live chat button on

00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,700
your site your phone number on your site

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,950
I don't advise to to your email instead

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,940
replace it with a a contact form so that

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,860
you can mind more detached from your

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,980
website visitors such as a name email

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,290
address phone number and maybe their

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,380
company may depends if you want that on

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,900
their location now how do you make your

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,540
website easy for Google and your

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,820
audience to trust you and find you and

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,030
they

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:31,330
happy ranked on Google here's my clients

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:33,680
story barren bedrooms this man came to

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,560
attendant by training area last staying

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,520
much I him he lamented that his website

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,680
that he abused over three years ago no

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,690
customers coming from me nobody calls in

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,530
rather he sales team keep going from

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,020
door to door to sell or do code : I know

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,540
that soon he didn't know what to do so I

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,060
had looked at his website and I said a

00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,740
lot of things wrong with the website

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:04,640
which I'll go through so this was my

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,910
strategy checklist I have the tools I

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,130
select my SEO which I'll discuss know

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,680
your target audience I asked him a

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,800
series of questions to understand who is

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,330
the target audience I did keyword

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,930
research we reviewed his competitors and

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:27,710
then did an audit of his website created

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:30,260
a strategy route map on how to help him

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,630
to start ranking on Google optimize the

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,910
website created a content strategy that

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,890
you follow build backlinks to the

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:41,540
websites and then monitor the progress

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,230
so the first thing these are the tools

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,320
that I use that you can start with the

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,260
simplest form is using the Google

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,400
autosuggest on Google ok just type in

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,530
the keyword of the maybe the industry or

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,710

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:33,089
sumo I use this tool a lot to find to do

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,370
competitive analysis to see what my

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:39,449
competitors content they're sharing

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,370
online and what people really are target

00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,260
audience usually hangouts on man what

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,160
which of their content has the most

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,820
shares on social media so I use possible

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,620
to find such content and then hotspots

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,170
blog topic generator or you can use that

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,120

I use that to generate headlines or you

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,330
just need to do is put in your subject

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,470
or keyword

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:14,440
the next no your ideal customer who is

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,690
your ideal customer very important for

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,600
Google search for SEO so that you don't

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:26,620
attract the wrong customers to your

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:30,100
website okay because for instance maybe

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,890
you and conga is a niche you sell like

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,649
my clients and conga when I looked at

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,550
his website I notice that ponga we are

00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:41,260
ranking for those keywords but he said

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,420
congas customers and not his ideal

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,570
customers his own ideal customers are

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,490
architects building construction

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,500
companies that is not looking for all

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:55,120
these individuals to command by his self

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,220
bathroom accessories so he's looking for

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,110
architects and do that so you need to

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,240
know who they are and you start by

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,430
asking questions answering such

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,170
questions like what product or services

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,690
do you offer these are the questions as

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,209
well as the word protocells duopa who is

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,660
your ideal customer and why we did need

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:16,180
your offer so the answer they give me in

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,850
depth answer why their customers need

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,570
their products what keywords we they use

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:25,000
to find your product or service on

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,000
Google and then who are your competitors

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,829
and need to know before so they told me

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,630
that their competitors we are you bad no

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:37,570
bathroom be on bathroom and Beyond and a

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,450
frakkin so those were his competitors

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,649
and from what he answered I was not able

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:47,440
to know his ideal customer person and I

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:50,170
did it this way penny is a building

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,910
contractor he wants to punish his

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:58,510
clients office building with the modern

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,520
water closets and he doesn't want to go

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,980
to the market to buy he will run a sales

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,339
office and check and what he lives

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,899

00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:25,260
things like WC toilet price in Nigerian

00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:28,089
and Google show him the relevant

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,139
websites ranking for such keywords by

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:37,449
their brand name location pricing

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:39,579
reviews and features now he clicks to

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:43,089
visit the website or landing page to

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:46,120
learn more and then make inquiry now

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,490
unlike his competitors such as conga

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,279
here he preferred not to put the price

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,170
on his sites because he said he

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,130
spaghetti audience and not the ones that

00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:00,130
are looking to buy retail the ones who

send the ball or deliver to the location

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,910
so this did not visit the website and

00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,360
make enquiry

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,480

he starts by browsing either by name

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:28,870
keyword location and price next he spat

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,149

see who is ranking for those keywords

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:04,959
the top five or top 10 then I check out

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,089
their website to see what they are doing

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,930
what is making them to be successful

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:17,830
next I use a tool called SEMRush it's

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:20,290

00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,350

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,770
strategy is shows you how they are

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,010
ranking on Google who their other

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:35,560
competitors are and who is linking to

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:39,190

advice they are running if they run ads

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:49,960

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:52,390
check the their strategy indeed this

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,620

ask them to also write about my clients

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:17,820
I make such decisions using these to

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:20,640
SEMRush okay and then I also visit the

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,740
competitor sites and see do they have a

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,130
blog okay what content are they sharing

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,890

trustworthy

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:11,850
you need to have SSL certificates this

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:13,830
HTTPS Google has given Ruta by July it

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:18,450
is not only been in fights that don't

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,920

help you to find out if your website

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:49,410
readable and informative we use SEO

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,710
plugin can show you are you visible on

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,630
google start by typing your keyword on

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,640
google to check so I these are the

00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,860
things I found out on my client site

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,810
they were invisible on Google the

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,460
presence of an invisible on Google even

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,770
though they were they had the a Google

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,940
map they weren't ranking for their

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,830
keyword with that Google map and they

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,630
were also not active on social media and

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,430
then who is talking about these are the

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,460
questions you need to ask to find out

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,710
all this

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,420
the answers to them then have you

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,890
installed Google Analytics they didn't

00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,420
have Google Analytics installed on their

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,300
website so that means there's no way for

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,160
them to find out how people are visiting

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,650
our website where they coming from what

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,680
keywords days visit their sites what the

00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,300
devices did they use now have you

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,520
submitted your site map of this that

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,890
question you need to ask okay what

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,410
actions they take on your website Google

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,480
I think should will show you all of that

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:49,160
and the keywords they used to find your

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,620
website now next I created their SEO

00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,300
strategy starting with their goal I

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,720
asked them what i/o goes they said they

00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,650
want to get generate leads sales

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,000
qualified links from there this SEO that

00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,309
would do for them so they wanted to

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,940
generate lead they wanted their websites

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:10,850
would be the source for all things

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:12,770
bathroom accessories and all that they

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,990
also wanted to increase websites from

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,929
such energy does not equivalent ascent

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,990
so the KPIs was number website traffic

00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:23,890
from different sources and then number

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:27,740
of leads to their website generated from

00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,900
Google now the fact is I shouldn't

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,450
roadmap opt-ins I will have to do I'll

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,490
have to define that target audience or

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,780
did their website

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:40,700
perform long tail keyword research

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,750
create content theme for writing

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:48,020
articles that are related to their

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:51,500
business then optimize the website get

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,179
backlinks and then track where their

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,550
leads are coming from whether they're

00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,750
coming from search engine or from social

00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,770
media from their email marketing

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,330
campaign and the others then these are

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,100
the reports that are be giving them

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,309
every month at the end of the month

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,970
total number of keywords okay

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:13,130
number of website visits number of lead

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,470
form fields and then attributes the

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,640
traffic and leads to the ethereal

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,150
sources whether they're coming from

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,140
social media or from such engine

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:28,279
and not us so this is strategy I created

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,789
for them next I went on to start

00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,350
optimizing their website they strut

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,250
step-by-step make sure that the key word

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,650
I used

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,320
I found from Google I use it to optimize

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,409
their URL you can see their place your

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,100
key word here the page title shouldn't

00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:49,580
exceed 60 characters Meta Description

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,559
should exceed 160 I also have to put

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,890
those keywords in those places even the

00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:57,940
header 1 header 2 and the body of their

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:00,470
contents then also in their image to

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,779
compress their image because this also

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,480
heavy Google complained that their site

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:09,320
images on the sidewalk heavy and the the

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,610
keywords we are missing in the the web

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,130
design before my web design I just

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:16,070
uploaded the images without renaming

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:21,649
them with the ideal keywords of their

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:24,980
products so I did all of that then link

00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:27,110
the websites with the pages they are the

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,480
link to the pages to other relevant

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,990
pages on their website so this is the

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:37,270
tool I use the Excel you can use Google

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:40,399
sheets or your Microsoft Excel so I

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:43,970
divided this way the products or the

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,760
page followed by the URL so I have to

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:50,870
rename the URL followed by the meta

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:54,110
description right it's the format and

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:56,179
then meta description you can see the

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:59,120
numbers is for me too which helps me to

00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:01,520
count how if I'm exceeding the 160

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,419
characters so I did all these in Excel

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,570
for all the important category pages and

00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:12,260
the landing pages the meta keyword the

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:14,840
header 1 header 2 and any categories so

00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,799
everything has to be done quite fast the

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,809
Guru said SEO is like accounting if you

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,700
miss one make one little mistake you've

00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:27,529
messed up the hooding so habitant has to

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,550
be done perfectly before you can now

00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:33,890
transfer to their website so this I use

00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,740
the google ships to do all that then

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:40,160
after that i cannot go to the website

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:45,110
make sure you use this installed in fact

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,590
add in the things i did on the google

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,570
sheets

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,780
i can start putting them in the used so

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:52,910
dizzy use SEO with this as a guide if

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,190
analysis as a guide to helping you if

00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:58,460
there are two things i omitted so if

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:00,740
it's good it shows good results if the

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,520
ASIMO improve mental problems he shows

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:07,520
me here so i had ordered in the SEO

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,190
title tag the meta description and the

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,230
focus cute because i know that i'm

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,640
writing for human beings not just for

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,740
google search engines so it's very

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,990
important that you also write for human

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,270
beings and also for google so this is

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,700
the way i did it i asked the client for

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,130
the details of the products what name of

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,740
your product says busy mixer what is it

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,170
all about he tells me the there are

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,990
technical terms cartridge this and that

00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,610
then i asked about the benefits of this

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,960
i tried to answer the benefit of this

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:40,130
business mister because I'm ready for

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,410
him and ins so writes the lifestyle and

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,420
all that stuff then I'll make the

00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:49,070
customer a part of the product so this

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:52,490
this the template I use for that then

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,740
next I did the product description this

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,380
is it here on this side of the page this

00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,950
was where I write everything following

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,090
the goo-goo guidelines a few guidelines

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:08,360
then the SEO try to track I put all that

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:10,160
in here the longtail keyword so this is

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,929
the one I've already searched on Google

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,700
what people are currently searching for

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:16,640
the keyword they look I'd put them in

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:20,390
the Meta Description in the SEO title

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,700

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,830
product description once I'm done with

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,040
it and then the focus keyword I can now

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:32,360
go and add it to their each of the pages

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,929
now creating the content strategy like I

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,250
said before

00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:36,560
find out public

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:42,170
content your audience loves to read I

00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,360
give example of a using Maryland so like

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,310

mindsets some come to your site they are

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:51,770

that your content and says them at their

00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:04,280
the different stage of their bind this

00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,320
the Johnny the buyers journey on your

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,050
website so there are wellness that is

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,820
for those who are not ready to buy it

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:13,250
they just want information so there are

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:18,860
times I usually type in things like 10

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:22,280
ways to do stuff 10 best things to buy

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,570

they're looking for checklist of things

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,190
they need to do to solve their problem

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,870
at that point so I create content for

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,360
those people those information seekers

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,190
then for those who are now ready to go

00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,040
to the next stage the consideration

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,770
stage I type in things like this vessel

00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:43,780
and what I get to notice by looking at

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:46,900
the clients Google the Google Analytics

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:50,450
the questions they ask I also check out

00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:53,300
questions asked on Maryland and even on

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,680
social media kudos as well like Facebook

00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,750
group or whatsapp groups I said the

00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,820
questions they asked day I can filter

00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:03,350
out the questions and Facebook group by

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,910
asking five paintings like challenges

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,410
people say I have a challenge I have

00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,470
this how can I do this

00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:12,530
I type in that and then I'll see the

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:16,250
questions so I use this format this

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:18,800
vessels that so for instance let's say

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,720
you're selling land we are realistic we

00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,960
are a realtor you want to sell land so

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,930
land is your vassals land without CFO

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,660
which should you buy or should you go

00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,760
for this this how it's done so language

00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,590
your focus our land without seafood we

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,590
should do by case bodies how

00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:42,560
samaya became a melon yahooeys

00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:46,730
real-estate investments that's examples

00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:50,090
of case studies reviews testimonials

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,590
from clients client interviews I seen

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,630
some companies that brought do that they

00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,170
were just interviewed Lea clients on

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,310
video and they tell them how the

00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:01,360
challenges they had at the beginning and

00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:04,130
how they moved the contacted the

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,230
companies to solve the problem for them

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:11,660
and how the the result of what they've

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,330
got that and so these clients introduced

00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,270
and then challenge so you can ask them

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,570
join our seven day challenge and learn

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:22,940
how to rebrand your business so

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,370
challenge these are the kind of blog

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:28,310
posts that you can write you can even be

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,830
a lead magnet so you can tell them sign

00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,780
up to get any of these to download this

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,910
so they sign up to your newsletter and

00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,600
then you can start following up with

00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:41,300
them in pants so SEO is like the top of

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,400
the funnel it's like you're the top of

00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,860
your marketing funnel to just drag

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,570
attract people who don't know you yet to

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,460
come to you there you can use these two

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,260
as the lead magnet to get them to

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,390
antiphonal and you can start follow up

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,760
with them with your email marketing so

00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,640
don't expect that SEO might give you on

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,590
the sales in need some would be ready to

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,960
buy at that point others are still

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,880
checking so have another strategy

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,230
backups ready to get them to convert

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,270
into leaves

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,429
there's the for the consideration stage

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,020
then the decision stage when the person

00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:14,540
is now ready to buy you see them the

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,850
type in stuff like price of this price

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,669
of that make sure you have things like

00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:22,250
how it works on your site so they can

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,560
see how what they are going to buy how

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,050
will it want to be the result for them

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,600
at the end of the day so how it was it's

00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,730
very important depending on your company

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,770
then frequently asked questions what are

00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,580
those questions that people customers

00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:40,330
usually ask you every time

00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,250
repeatedly water d-list them out to the

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,800
alphas and put it on your site you can

00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,240
put it on your pricing page okay for

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,920
those who are checking out your price

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,570
and then they scroll down to see the

00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,850
questions and answers because they want

00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,340
to see what would like to be like after

00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,710
I've invested in this your product or

00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,330
services might life be better when I get

00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,710
what I'm looking for that's the frequent

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:04,300
that the job of the frequently asked

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:07,570
questions and then so calculator could

00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:10,210
be for people in maybe delune or

00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,600
insurance company they can she used to

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,480
check how much it'll take for them to

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,660
achieve the result so you can use any of

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,690
this format for your decision still for

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,940
