wordpress site on Amazon Web Services

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:23,060

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,340
cloud computing and my own experience is

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,110
Amazon Web Services so can we do

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,750

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,360
so can we put our phones on silent

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,400
please thank you very much now my own

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,600
experience with cloud computing starts

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,370
in 2015 so so 2013 sorry I was working

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,390
on a project and now the first time I

00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,960
would use Microsoft Azure but along the

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,970
line I started doing research and you

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,260
want to leave the enterprise because I

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,970
love the company they want to leave the

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,830
enterprise the beauty of being a

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,830
freelancer is that you

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,280
why do you think the enterprise the

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:29,049
beauty of being a freelancer is that you

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,509
get this option of you get to choose

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,729
your own to stock going forward so I

00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:36,280
chose my own to stock and I said okay I

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:38,649
was going to look for some of the best

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,819
tools in the a category and I found out

00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,979
that Amazon was actually the best

00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,929
Microsoft Microsoft lovers can argue but

00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,000
I found that it's actually one of the

00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,459
best out there so I picked it up a style

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,799
using it so this is just my own

00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:57,099
experience I officially committed to

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,899
Amazon Web Services May last year this

00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,479
is me paying for the hosting and doing

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:04,329
everything myself so this website is my

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,880
personal sites Christina and accomm runs

00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:08,440
on Amazon Web Services some of it is my

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,329
own experience some of the it is the

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,049
experience of just running other

00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:18,989
services now you can tweet about this

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,989

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,940
like I'm about to use this hashtag of

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:50,209
words written on this event thank you

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:53,239
very much now at least about me I was

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:56,680
born lived in Legos my whole life I

00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,400
start using WordPress in 2012 this is

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,140
this is my wordpress site you know what

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,129
whenever I close down on account so it's

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,660
still up and running

00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:08,569
I studied systems engineering at

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,720
University of Lagos currently I had

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,760
training at spark Academy once upon a

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,980
time I used to be a game developer once

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,329
upon a time it didn't work out but it

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,239
was a very interesting experience now

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,400
for me I I said it personally you have

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,620
to be a developer to use Amazon Web

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,500
Services you can't you can't not know

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,130
how to code or I don't know I was up

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,250
upon shell prompt before shell prompt

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,389
command prompt however some don't Java

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,829
so if you don't generally know what the

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:41,720
command prompt is so if you've open

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,970
command prompt and you get a headache

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,069
I think this is the wrong session like

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,780
if you open the energy and you get a

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,180
headache you know what we're talking

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,919
about this is the wrong session there

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,870
are civilian sessions in this play god

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,280
this is the wrong this is this is

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:00,919
military so now the thing is this you

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,530
will be responsible for managing your

00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,000
entire survive barber towers coming in

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,970
at the end of that session what lady

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,230
said something about assessing SSL

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:16,910
Certificates being flagged as unsecured

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:19,280
on websites by July now if you use a

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,049
hosting provider you have to contact

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,970
them ordered it for you automatically

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,620
most of them are often it's like if you

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,990
go upstairs as this hosting provider

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,410
upstairs they are running for free

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,960
already

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,190
ok yes they are ready I don't want to

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,840
mention names on this stage so you

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,880
understand now they are ready for free

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,169
already so

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,949
that's the lovely you have when you have

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,650
a hosting provider in my case I have to

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,990
update my sites by myself so I'm

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,970
responsible for everything is it good

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,340
yes is it bad

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,789
yes the answer is let me talk like a

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,250
lawyer it depends you get so much

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:58,470
control but with that control you also

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,259
get so much power so you can't crash

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,460
your entire website and have to rebuild

00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,910
it because that's happened to me before

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,590
so what what is Amazon Web Services is

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,830
infrastructure for applications that's

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,590
how I like to think about it it's you

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,900
knowing that you have a base on which to

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,780
build any app you want to build its

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,900
storage computing databases and

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,990
management tools and if you understand

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,520
that it's going to be a lot of work it's

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,190
gonna be you building an infrastructure

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,539
from scratch the only beauty being that

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,449
you would control your infrastructure

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,889
end-to-end then Amazon Web Services

00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,080
something you want to try out is a cloud

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,530
computing platform which we've already

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,830
set an example which we Microsoft Azure

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:48,810
digitalocean

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:52,380
Heroku now okay so pros and cons down

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,940
it's easy to use now then again I think

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,260
if you've already done the learning

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,570
curve of being a developer a lot of

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,070
things are easy so for me how taste is

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,139
its use it's reliable it never goes down

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:07,349
it's absolutely beautiful in that it's

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:10,860
secure for me big con is it's a UNIX

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:13,320
environment so it's not yes I use

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,830
Windows and I started with Windows I'm a

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,419
Windows fan but the truth is this the

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,949
moment you decide to do Amazon Web

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,010
Services you've crossed the dark side I

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:26,039
mean I was so Star Wars where Luke

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,810
Skywalker became that Vader yes so the

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,849
moment you decided to Domino a services

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,770
that's you that's your transition so

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:35,880
there's a learning curve you have to

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,110
read I I hate reading but it's something

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,050
that is necessary and then there's a

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,150
high cost ok so on average if you want

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,990
one website my personal website cost

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,070
like $3,000 a month now that is every

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,160
two months I come back

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,450
a cheap domain I don't know if you

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,940
understand what I'm saying every two

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,980
months I can spend six can buy a cheap

00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,480
domain and hosting and I'm only spending

00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,760
that because I put in emails I put in a

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,590
bit of hosting I'm not even doing

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:12,390
storage but it cost me on average three

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,770
thousand nine months so I have like 15

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,750
minutes so I'll just quickly run through

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,300
the slides I will apologize because

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,950
somebody register disappointment that a

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,620
session like this should be practical

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:25,020
and I agree I agree we should sit down

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,030
and really kono any talk so let me

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,130
apologize ahead of time now why did I

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,440
take the leap so I have 15 minutes why

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,570
did I take the leap frustration from web

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,560
host I don't know if you might have

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,420
gotten better in 2018 but 2012 no let me

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,010
talk because you know someone is not in

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,840
say well there are some where was a

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,910
sponsor this event so please

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,190
I will not all right a queue myself that

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,880
commit suicide so please do not leave

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,850
the bag

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,920
please it's like been recorded so I like

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,860
you - OH - I'll commit suicide now some

00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,900
web host we're really performing

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,360
excellently in 2012 they were very

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,890
excited I was getting frustrated and you

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,410
know you send an email there's a time

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,110
lapse they now don't respond or the

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,680
respond is too late and you know clients

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,010
if your head is your head that is being

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,360
on the chopping block so I decided that

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,250
okay what was the problem

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,260
it's not to be developed wise you know

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,540
to look at it is not look at the show

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,370
and that was my own decision now digital

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,000
convergence this is really the pathway

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,490
is worrisome when I did I left the stand

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,460
and UN Department it was all you needed

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,010
to be was to be a programmer didn't have

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,200
to understand electronics but today we

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,630
are talking about IOT we're talking

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,820
about things that there are so much

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,910
convergence that you know not to be

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:53,700
obsolete you might have to cross over

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:56,520
I mean of you CCNA people CCNE CCNA you

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,670
know that the recent CCNA boxes you run

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,860
on Python so this Python

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,900
please please please does the next point

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,060
digital absolutely since the reason why

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,070
Mama's ruled the world is not because we

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,890
got here first is because the dinosaurs

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,930
feel to evolve and that's the danger

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,830
would be a programmer there's always new

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,360
tech there's no jazz days larval there's

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,700
one new form of Technology

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,040
I feel regardless of where technology

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,010
does next car computing is always going

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,110
to be there as a standard so our Rogers

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,410
future-proof my career from his

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,230
insurance now this is another site that

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,780
I'm running I'm beautified for the

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,850
machinery said calm because of the

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,430
phases of the project it was a very good

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,250
strong it was a very good good case to

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,690
make for cloud computing so the first

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,940
phase is where we would run WordPress

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,820
which is we'll run a basic dynamic

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,290
website but the second phase is where it

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,450
starts to get tricky where we'll be

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,330
running ecommerce so the plan is to sell

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,670
data online and in the third phase don't

00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,130
have a data analytics dashboard there's

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,050
a lot of coding behind this but when you

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,940
see your roadmap and this is where you

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,530
have to use cloud computing when you see

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,950
the roadmap of a project and then you

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:14,170
realize that if I go with conventional

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,670
hosting at some point in time I'll be

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,430
stuck remember

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,010
Amazon Web Services first and foremost

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:24,820
infrastructure so it's not too much

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,800
infrastructure like a jug of know you

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,110
mentioned about stable is not so much

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,430
infrastructure you don't set it it's not

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,950
so much infrastructure its

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,230
infrastructure is it's cloud computing

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,450
infrastructure and when you realize your

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,790
project specifications and you see the

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,300
complexity of the projects sometimes you

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,540
might want to assume control now the

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,770
first step is you go to this website you

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,130
need a credit card

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,620
most banks in Nigeria have become online

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,839
friendly so I have like 10 minutes left

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,880
so just really rush through this part is

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,460
easy you just log into your console

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,410
though this e-mail verification process

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,000
is quite easy then you get this

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,980
dashboard this is my own personal

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,370
dashboard my five most important

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,080
services are billing work meal I use

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,320
easy to which is the computing part of

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,900
it which is where your

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,510
servoz out your wordpress is hosted I

00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,890
use Amazon legs which is more for

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:24,710
research and when I was ahead of Alexa

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,210
okay whatever Amazon Puli I wasn't

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,910
pulling now let me that's another reason

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,800
why I think cloud computing is going to

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,320
become more important a lot of stuff

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,020
dies cutting edge will be rolled out on

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,240
Amazon first for their developers and

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:44,480
Amazon police a service that allows you

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,550
convert your blog post to podcast so

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,230
once you've written your blog post it's

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,220
a what a co Amazon Puli the plugin is

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,080
text-to-speech if the taxes peach

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,030
converter it just allows you to that

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,280
seamlessly now if you're not running on

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,880
Amazon Web Services you have to wait on

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:05,900
to your civilians get it sorry

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,300
now route 53 is perhaps one of the best

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,370
DNS management services in the world now

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,370
I didn't put this in this slide but I

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,530
will mention it because I also skip

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,110
through very quickly that the

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:21,350
alternative to this in traditional

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,400
hosting like cpanel hosting VPS it's

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,750
like your own virtual private server

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,490
dedicated server but your virtual

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,170
private server so it's right in the

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,920
middle that's the alternative to Amazon

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,980
Web Services

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,660
so with rule 53 you basically this is

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,910
how I start my own domain you check for

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,630
the ability of a domain you add it to

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:45,350
the cards now if you watch the shopping

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,960
cart on your on this side now be your

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:53,060
left the moment you wanted to cut it

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,380
shows up day you paid $12 every year and

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,720
then the rest is easy filling your

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,610
contact details you verify on the tools

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,500
it's a very self guided process I

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,690
promise you if you read through the

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,730
documentation is self-guided and that's

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,260
why the best way to start our computing

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,530
is buy your own domain

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,190
eat your own dog food I have probably

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:16,220
read on this website three times so like

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,260
the first time I did it how come I'll

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,800
come to that points now WordPress cloud

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,520
image how many of us know bitNami okay

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,320
so bitNami is a great way to judge

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,110
package your wand and then they give you

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,120
as an installer think of it like a

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,860
possible installer you just take that

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,110
and then you install it so you use the

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,030
cloud image and then so you use that

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,800
cloud image you go to the AWS

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:46,690
marketplace and then you this is you

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,450
choose an instant type and basically all

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:54,490
you're doing is you are attaching your

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:57,160
bitNami cloud image to your Amazon

00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,220
account and another what T to dos tittle

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,800
is one of those micro services that it's

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,300
not as powerful as most of the things

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,300
was a great place to start on the fridge

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,610
here it's a learning curve and you have

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,610
to give yourself time to just learn it

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,140
and you name your instance and this is

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,420
all in the documentation and then you

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,520
launch it now this is the part where you

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,060
might have to redo your sites choice I

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,560
mean I was I've seen this movie matrix

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,080
what happened what went wrong in matrix

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,390
it was we made the machines and the

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,240
machines what happened the machines took

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,580
over and another happens when running

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,610
cloud computing you need to be very

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,500
careful on the documentation they will

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,560
tell you that you don't need a keep here

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:47,620
but trust me on this if you don't put a

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:50,170
keep here this is what happens dagger is

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,290
evil like so so it gets the setting

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,240
points in your development where because

00:14:53,290 --> 00:15:00,550
you didn't put a clip in the crocodile

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,960
shows up and it's all your files and not

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,030
it's but you cannot access your

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,610
WordPress website they will ask you for

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:09,220
something that inevitably is still it

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,440
keep here because you know we try to FTP

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,570
sometimes and when you try and FTP and

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,550
then you don't have a keep here what

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,380
next but I keep here because I have time

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:22,840
to talk about it the keep here is

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:27,160
basically authentication so you ought

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,690
indicate with that server and if I said

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,160
write a secret number we share the

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,550
number but he doesn't know the number

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,100
then we now I agree on the basis of its

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,800
its crypto is photography we not Rea

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,129
only basis

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,100
decoding what we have shared now you

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,470
must have a copy and then you will have

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,809
a copy the dangerous thing is if you

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,970
don't have a key pair you put yourself

00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:52,689
in jeopardy when once you get to a place

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:56,689
where as you're running certain services

00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:59,720
certain plugins require root access in

00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:02,299
WordPress I hope you're the sort of say

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,699
so I probably modify your config file

00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:06,499
now once you meet a plug-in like that

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,559
the crocodile shows up if you don't have

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:11,389
a keep here because you need your you

00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,970
need your keep here to talk to your

00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:16,730
server and say allow this plug-in modify

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,959
settings at that points if you don't

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,759
have a key pair even though the

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,089
documentation says you don't need to

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,699
keep here please use a keep here because

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,100
it's the documentation it's a safe

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:30,290
environment but if you run this for

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,639
yourself you might have to redo your

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:37,429
work it's really painful but it's a

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,920
learning experience so these are little

00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:43,339
instances I I had I had to terminate

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,949
this one from experience and the rest is

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:48,740
easy at this point you get your public

00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:50,869
IP and then I really had to rush the

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,029
session I really apologize but what I

00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:55,850
would just say is this it's really easy

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,889
once you've done the learning curve of

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,920
being a programmer this is really easy

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:05,510
this isn't this isn't walk this is like

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,850
masters masters this is like a master's

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,490
degree is where I think developers need

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,439
to start green because the technology is

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,029
not going to wait for us Amazon Poly is

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,319
already on version one there's

00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:18,289
technology now that can allow you

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,209
convert your blog posts into podcasts

00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:26,389
there will be more services like that

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:29,630
chat bots are becoming crazy and to be

00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:31,340
left behind as a developer is I've been

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,380
here for some time I think I think I'll

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,899
say I've been I've been developing long

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,059
enough I've seen I was one of the few

00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:39,889
Delphi programmers who drink gets

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,899
become extinct is Delphi as a

00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:42,889
programming language you know what

00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:46,640
happened with the Olfa

00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:48,920
the makeup I switched over to

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,920
c-sharp became the architect for seizure

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,230
case was the Delphi so programming

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,299
languages come and go so this is one

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,820
thing I think as technology developers

00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:02,120
have to start thinking about will it be

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,520
easy it depends

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,950
I didn't as a fair answer but the

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,750
easiest way to get started is user

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,929
sandbox and that's your personal website

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,150
I can't crash my personal website dupe

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:15,770
my personal website three times so you

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,010
don't get a good backup plug-in you

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,960
exports you make your Twinkies you crash

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,640
your site's you blend something you've

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,760
learned what doesn't work if you do

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,150
enough nonsense you get two cents but

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,530
but it is there has to be enough just

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,490
remember with great power comes great

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,540
responsibility

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,540
