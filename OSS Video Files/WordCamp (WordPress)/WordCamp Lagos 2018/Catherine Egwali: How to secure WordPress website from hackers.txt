hello everyone how is they hope we had a

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,660
nice sight during the coffee break

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,740
yep

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:19,800
so you're refreshed relaxed and we're

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:22,910
ready to stop beautiful so today what I

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,910
want to talk about

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:31,410
how to secure your WordPress website

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:35,460
from Hawkins so you can have peace how

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,910
many of us here experienced having a

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,239
site's

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:46,790
past before maybe for your clients for

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,790
yourself okay great

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:58,949
Wow in order to avoid Stowe is not touch

00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:01,859
it's usually very important to consider

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,960
security for the own sense none of us

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,690
really afterwards because they'd be more

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,460
expensive when you consider afterwards

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:13,679
for workers like at the beginning it's

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,460
relatively cheaper you know it's just

00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,869
like some of us view the skyscraper and

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,550
the person didn't know at the beginning

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,750
I wanted to be the skyscraper as well

00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,750
okay I want to be the manga

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,430
and the foundation is where it won't go

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,890
kind of matching what will happen when

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,420
it starts to huge first floor second

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,090
floor third floor do you think you'll

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,100
get to the future I'm not sure they'll

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:42,440
probably come down why the foundation

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:46,550
they would spend more because that he

00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:50,210
thought he was saving money by not doing

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,550
the right foundation but later on they

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,440
would have to spend much more because

00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,050
the money spent would have been wasted

00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,610
down would have to come down and you

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:07,790
have to start afresh so today it's my

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:10,670
desire that we'll learn how to get the

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,709
try from the beginning because of our

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,010
time constraints I think - we'll be able

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:17,840
to go deep into okay already started

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,450
well how do we're going to be doing

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,340
would also equal for those already have

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,530
their own website work immediately no

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,440
prints but right now today our main

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,810
focus would be more we were just

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,670
starting afresh what are the Institute

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,730
because it's kind of like easier and

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,700
cheaper when you're starting afresh as

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,670
against Wayne

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,930
that's not my rating for its DVD years

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:48,069
and things like that okay fantastic

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,470
so you can protect your brand we can

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,540
prevent loss of sales you can grow your

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:58,260
business when you have a secure site

00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:01,209
that benefits your customers and

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,870
definitely where your brand is protected

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,900
you know like and trust you all this

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,030
will help each other successful business

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,890
where you can make money where people

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,280
can visit your site and they feel that

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,470
information is secure the field if I

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,959
enter my credit card details

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,599
nobody's gonna steal my credit card

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,760
details and use it on another site they

00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,769
will buy from you when imagine if you

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,010
have customers who don't trust energy is

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:36,720
their card what do you think will happen

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,720
which is sales loss of income because

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:46,180
if you can collect payments online that

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,500
means you have a huge possibility to get

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,090
money from as many people as possible

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,209
you can have people from Tokyo us United

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,060
Kingdom pay on your science but what if

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,810
all these people hundreds and thousands

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:07,810
of people go to your site that I like

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:10,330
it's to be in my bank did my card

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,390
details someone can easily guide their

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,180
data sites do you think I want to be so

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:22,330
you might have invested in doing

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:25,990
Facebook Ads Google Ads solo ads pay for

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:28,960
different things and the conversion

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,930
rates would not be happy but why does

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,910
you put somewhere we have not secured

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,120
and site enough to make people trust you

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:41,110
to put in that details consumer lose

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,940
money but you can get it right you be

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,990
able to build a successful business how

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,010
many people here want to be the

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:51,949
successful business lovely so that's why

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:55,320
you have secured your sites very well

00:04:51,949 --> 00:05:00,889
so let me tell you a little bit about

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,630
what I do I am an online business coach

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,550
I'm a lot of things and consultants I

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,509
help it to clean you know stretch it

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,340
that business rules by using secure and

00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,979
successful WordPress sites that gets

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,330
people that is always on the desire you

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,660
know you could use WordPress to do

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,479
almost anything so basically what I do

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,030
is to oh people get the solutions that

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,880
design by using WordPress I heart of it

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:32,220
is ensuring that you have a secure

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:34,440
website it's very important okay so I'm

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,750
going to be talking to you about how to

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,389
secure WordPress website for rockers and

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:47,389
I'm going to be showing you several

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:48,770
things today it's going to be like

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,430
there's gonna be some form of

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:56,419
demonstration so if we have our laptops

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,470
and you want to follow along click over

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,009
your own sides

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,300
yes you can okay but would also be

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,789
looking at what I'm gonna do

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,789
so we're going to install an SSL

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:09,199
Certificates to protect the

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,180
communication or your sites

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,340
how many people here know what an SSL

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,099
certificate is okay fantastic

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,550
okay on the second one so is it it's all

00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:22,550
certificates that you can use to either

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,229
validate and people you are this of

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,690
significance they can confirm that

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:30,889
indeed this person is who they say they

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,759
are indeed this organisation is who they

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,379
claim to be depending on the temple

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,139
Association as a New England and a lot

00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:42,110
they can help increase protects the

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,810
communication of your science the HTTP

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,250
that you see when you enter an address

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:52,310
on the address bar it means the

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,099
information there is Clinton's but why

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,430
did I see the S at the end it means that

00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:01,490
it's relatively security communication

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,810
on that science is encrypted so it was

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,130
so maybe an arc are trying to snoop and

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,860
check what's going on at the network

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,350
what's data of information is passing

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,009
across the network

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:19,400
things like your password things like

00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:22,400
maybe credit card details information

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,050
that people are putting on that site and

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,009
it's very important nowadays to have an

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,300
SSL Certificates before it was almost

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,090
something to take for granted

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,699
they'll tell you oh it's good to get

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,199
like oh I'm coming maybe a painting of

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,910
the costs after prices are some students

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:45,590
may be like it was we don't need it now

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:48,169
now but you don't really need it now

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,699
would put it's a time where the type of

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:57,380
us will do it a forecast initial sensing

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:59,599
but now if you visit a browser like

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,090
Chrome and I think back cause I think

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,460
Rome wants to do that up from so much

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,370
from now about Firefox UPC they utterly

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:10,130
the site is not secure that's not your

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:13,370
brand so I don't really have a website

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,169
right now and does have with GPS if

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,190
people visit your site depending on the

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:21,349
browser can imagine if Google is telling

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,229
them this idea grace is not secure

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:27,169
it should they don't I would wonder if

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,889
they're about to any decency like this

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,800
is not secure

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,570
I don't want to come here oh like that

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,969
whatever I'm nobody

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,969
okay so quickly

00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:44,100
I would love to show us how to install

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:47,290
an SSL certificate soon I think as

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,740
talking are we doing the practicals and

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,410
depending on the time and we just Russia

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,120
madness but that would also lent it to

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,120
now see how it is

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,110
let me proceed no he is fine

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,330
beautiful

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,960
so another thing I'm going to be showing

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,480
you is out of these plugins and teams so

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,510
that you can avoid attacks for what

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,980
abilities in outdated additions so

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:30,490
people like today updates right what's

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,760
the benefit of updated now if you don't

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,530
update any is an outdated versions they

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,350
might be vulnerabilities new pose that's

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:44,110
widely known and the authors would have

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:48,010
protected you want updates at once so

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:52,120
that you could utilize the ones that

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:55,960
have the vulnerabilities fixed and

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,850
patched but if you were to say no I

00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,640
don't have that time I'll do it later

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,020
you procrastinate or you don't know the

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,710
right way to get it done

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,120
did you miss out okay but today we're

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,410
going to see how to update and some

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,780
transitions and they don't know what to

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:14,410
do it's like okay I'm coming developer

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:18,100
developer I hope me and it says a little

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,830
bits at a thousand I'm like 90,000 we

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,900
can't commit they procrastinate what if

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,480
you don't have to do it then you could

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,850

then you'll find this training useful so

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:54,040
let's look at the typical problems that

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:56,580
people tend to have and why this topic

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,590
is important

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,580
I've mentioned earlier that people be

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:06,280
afraid to shop when the browser that's

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,530
telling them the site is not secure if

00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,870
you had to visit the websites and you're

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,390
being told the site is not secure what

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:16,030
would you do so people be afraid of you

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:18,850
enable to athletes ask corner to people

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:22,020
if they are saying not secure than the

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,820
publicity man shouldn't proceed or well

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,100
if I do need to include any details

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,520
maybe I just need to read the Commission

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,240
that wraps a cuter just proceed but

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,190
because it's a bit of attention a

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,410
fleeting notice technologies you can so

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,950
people probably say no I want to go

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,410
there ready to download a virus

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:47,430
other people are given have been uneven

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:52,510
agreements so the people will not even

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:55,740
venture a father that's work sites like

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:59,590
arrested in I need hundred thousand-plus

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,140
in there or maybe Thousand doors in

00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,470
Dulles to get someone to do it for you

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,650
or maybe the developer said bikini as a

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,230
backer maybe some Authority for security

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:17,380
enhancement I said no I it's too much

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:19,600
now who knows me don't worry I'll be

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:24,580
straight out these make them like that

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:27,850
suffice you know they are - like out of

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,540
the world with those my websites are we

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,390
do it later

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,340
nobody nobody nobody wants a sacrifice I

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,600
don't really have anything of importance

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,300
of our site that you want to still

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:43,270
prosecute you know up to it sometime

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:45,790
okay so another thing problem could be

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,010
that you do sales doing a product launch

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,700
because you start was taken away who

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:55,290
supermarina for sending spam what times

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,290
when people site get hot

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:04,320
part of what is reused for is that video

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:06,840
get send out spam videos and the hosting

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,790
provider will shut down that sites in

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:15,660
order to reduce the level of art option

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:19,740
to reduce the impacts because once a

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,740
summer begins to send out spam the

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,500
alcázar get blacklisted a lot like that

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,700
gets blacklisted on those times hosting

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,520
provider probably give you email service

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,320
and web service on the same summer that

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,460
means when people need to send out

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,830
emails then bills to begin to bounce you

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:45,840
because the IP address of that sour have

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:48,540
been listed on major IP blacklist sites

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:53,120
by the way I have some background in

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:57,030
losing my company easy to post in

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,980
website is an organization I have an

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:02,790
understanding about some of the spectrum

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,680
yeah so definitely by the time you begin

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,630
to set up fun you need to shut it down

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:12,060
you need to try to reduce the impacts

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:15,000
now imagine and this is actually a real

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,800
life story I know two people the sort I

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,040
was about to know she was really making

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,880
them campaigns okay this product of

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,690
zelenov unfortunately aside Twain's of

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:32,160
mine during that time there was attacked

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:34,200
our attack mostly provider had to shut

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,660
down an account temporarily until she

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:42,450
could sort it out flinging it off danny

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:45,030
bako and the painful part of it couch

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:51,800
even sometimes you look like if they are

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:51,800
saving money we look at it that add-ons

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,140
subdomains and say oh what's this

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,970
awesome package and you put as many

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,680
websites as possible

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,890
now that's why I cried it's a good day

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,640
yeah you're saving money but then when

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,160
something like this happens it's Fenmore

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,070
that means if you had like five websites

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,650
on the hosting accounts and that

00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:19,500
particular hosting account gets shot

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,990
that what happened like all right go

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,330
down so that was what happened for this

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,970
lady she was really for mochi she was

00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,220
about to launch something and

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:33,720
unfortunately during that time she had

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,520
our size of that house so all of our

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,800
websites went down so you could even say

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,460
oh let me go to another website and use

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,050
the contact form to say that sorry I am

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,630
 even your big profits in this

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:50,010
thing on social media and I really want

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:52,350
to sign up for your academic so that was

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,420
really painful she did lose some money

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,800
doing it product launch because not

00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,420
everybody will have that patient to come

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:02,400
back the woman what happens how many

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,600
times you want to actually buy something

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,549
and

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,070
reason something comes up we forget we

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:11,700
move on like okay we lit up and you

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:14,340
never get around to me let me tell you

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,799
another story there was someone that was

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,360
doing a product launch it was supposed

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
to do an accord it was supposed to do it

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,970
cost and there was announcing on social

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,660
media who keep marketing so many things

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,840
like that

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,410
and unfortunately towards the time it

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:36,140
was supposed to launch his course the

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,140
website went down it was really tiring

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,360
during that period and I think a lot of

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,220
people to ask for a refund especially if

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,850
you don't know really when interested

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,169
because summer maybe is most times you

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,850
could have another he's so much

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,890
interested it but hoarsely we have

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,980
nobody made up your mind that's typical

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,200
of my dad mobilize and the person a

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,450
cracker or the reformer who can give me

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,880
back my money just because it was like

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,450
one or two day today because we also

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,130
have to sort out his website and

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,020
deliberate might have been no bike cycle

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,210
generally when you have something as a

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,990
worker's that you need to sort it out

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:18,419
it was tired he was stressed on and not

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,890
have people saying kindly give me every

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,440
for and you have not suffered from

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,350
severe attack of Zuni you know started

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,670
look at what happened

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:32,460
it lost some money why because the

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,110
psycho heartlessly so it's my desire

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,630
that much as possible

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,370
we'll then what to do to reduce the

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,140
possibilities of having our sights

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,480
against anomalies that does not mean

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,030
that your psychic never get out because

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,260
there's always so much I can teach their

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,760
industry within our limits at night but

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,890
I believe that the things I'm going to

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,380
teach you well this whole internet sense

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:59,280
to help reduce the possibilities of

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,680
getting hands if you are questions you

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:09,180
can ask them a session for Question and

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:12,690
Answer trance and so if you are not tech

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,850
savvy and your IT personnel wants to

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,460
charge you fortune you definitely find

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,040
this useful maybe you'll be saying you

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:24,900
don't want to secure a site yet because

00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:28,680
they said okay mm I'm trying out that

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:33,060
right now oh it would pay $15,000 right

00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:35,820
I'm still trying to come back next week

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,640
well 15,000 area is known for chicken I

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,410
guess it's relative but basically if you

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,750

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,150
be able to save yourself some money and

the person exactly given and second so

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,570
of some money of having each big fixed

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,460
if your site were to be hot because I

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,840
can be very annoying and people can

00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,660
charge you almost any amount of money

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,330

interested is everybody that knows how

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,140
to clean in a hot scientist because

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,480
nobody help play their half sizes to

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,970
ensure that you don't get hot to gain as

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,550
much as possible otherwise you keep

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,640
losing money you keep losing time you

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,270
keep losing customers though I don't

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,480
think any of us want to do that do we no

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:31,510
so that's why we're here today

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:35,260
so lastly we cannot show up the best

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,880
practices to secure in a site you eat

00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:41,560
somebody for what we have to talk about

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,630
today so weekly opportunities that you

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,970
have from this training is to learn how

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,220
to protect your brand avoid loss of

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,550
income through your business by using

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:56,220
successful and secure sizes either for

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,220
yourself or for your pilot's now

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,900
when you host your site will to be a

00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,690
trust to your customers

00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,140
I mentioned that by the fact that I see

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:10,120
that padlock sign that helps them

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,220
disappears the fact that the process not

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,820
telling them the site is not secure

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,650
these myths they have a kiss at rest and

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,540
the will to proceed to do whatever

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,140
activities they plan on doing on your

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,840
site

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,320
another thing is saves you time and

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,570
money

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,330
he told us the story of how they spent

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,970
months trying to get their site back

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,820
online

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,860
that's a long time so you can save

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:41,160
yourself time we can save yourself some

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:43,750
money when you get trained at the onset

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,090
you can also get to use the super your

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,310
business apart from the fact I said when

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:52,060
your site is your beginning to trust you

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,830
know to buy your science as a designer

00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,230
and a developer you might be able to

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,390
just get the maintenance contracts for

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,220
your customers will knowledge you have

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,070
you can enlighten them let them know

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,050
what it's time to lose we all know what

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,360
it starts to lose then having the

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,900
contracts maybe the framing of the

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,940
package 5,000 10,000 50,000 hundred

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,660
thousand maybe maintenance package

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,860
whether per month or per year

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,710
you could let them see that they

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,880
actually saving money because if someone

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,830
were to lose 3 billionaire over 10

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,750
million error during the product launch

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,420
because the site's great down for being

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,150
hot

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,190
et I just spent fifty thousand marry a

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,610
hundred thousand L what is it that beat

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,340
them

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,799
wait does the amounts from their mother

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,580
could have gained that is that love the

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:50,100
noise so if it sensitize maybe your

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,960
business partners but sensitizing

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,900
customers then you'll also be able to

00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:00,410
make some money from it if you developer

00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:06,179
and you want to charge for the security

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:09,900
so just within console steps they can

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:12,360
use the scale website and ensure that

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:17,000
you have peace of mind so I can sleep

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,770
well first of all install SSL

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,090
Certificates become choose to either buy

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:26,429
or utilize free SSL Certificates so

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,410
there's some hosting complex actually

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:31,620
give out spread some certificates like

00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:34,410
my organisation Todt stuff there's a

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,720
site organization so much the public

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,120
that would give you maybe little treats

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,600
so that now we get to save some money

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,240
and we don't have to pay for SSL

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,660
certificates but you still desire to buy

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,790
maybe because of warranty perhaps is

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,060
something which actually happened Stalin

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:56,670
so many people are born that's all

00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,700
if you just want the idea of warranty

00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,100
yeah you could go fine or you want maybe

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,300
an extended validated as a substitute if

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,860
you want I'll actually show you that

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:14,340
this whole thing so is who they claim to

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:18,150
be because it's I have SSL certificates

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:21,180
but it can be used for tricking people

00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,740
into giving their credentials maybe they

00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,140
are pretending to be GTV

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,730
if you observe because it is this

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,410
website and then I will reduce the

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,840
problem connected to the Internet

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,390
there's oxide you go to you actually see

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,270
the name of the organization at the

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,310
address bar they have been quite some

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,220
amount of money in order to get a kind

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,900
of certificates so the different levels

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:47,100
of certificates different types they are

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:49,980
all secure but if I'm in or if you want

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:56,090
to go the extra mile you could pay for

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,090
one so one minute

00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,380
PLC first if you like to go yet the

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,380
Nigeria everyone if you have to go here

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,830
you'll new field rest assured that oh

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,530
okay this is who they say they are so

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,210
it's not just about the HTTP remember I

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,500
told you you can use this for validation

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:22,030
and you can also use it for encryption

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,860
so even though you can have a site next

00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,700
and Krypton you might be go into the

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:31,780
fake sites

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:35,860
yeah okay so this is this tells us that

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:38,680
in this it doesn't very provide by this

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,840
organization but then I'm the rudest

00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:47,020
thing to be treated so I just went along

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,400
in here she's Mississippi I wanna do

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,400

queen is stop doing

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,870
however equates the WordPress site here

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,820
because I want us to see the process let

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,100
it be practical I know the most likely

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,010
things that practical people tend to

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,590
remember more so hopefully that's the

00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:48,530
desire by believe here we met on the

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:52,490
standard now so I'm going to be creating

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:54,260
the WordPress websites or this sub

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,750
domain called what condos country

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,450

00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:26,549
granulated accidents who knows Phelps I

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,320
might even have answered it before the

00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:32,509
question answer period for not to

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,509
started oops

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:48,520
so Mazda let's Lincoln said get hot they

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:53,800
we shall free SSL so I'll serve delete

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:55,720
some of this engine for so that's a

00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,760
Glock that I got like that if you meet

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:03,190
me I'm here and get tissue now the thing

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,020
is the Germans have to be right

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,020
otherwise that they're gonna be nervous

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,460
basically the records have to face to

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,910
that spot collapse American between here

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:18,580
and the making is elsewhere then they

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,470
should be something that says okay this

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,060
domain name will be hosted on this

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,660
particular segment is pointing to that

00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,330
sir

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,850
I forgot the DNS record that information

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:31,350
is working be able to successfully

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,910
install it how many feet is degree is

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,910
everyone and they are amount after I

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,220
already saw this there's a service that

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,940
you get is in stone very quickly so

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,630
easily

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:47,320
so that's if maybe you selects and cream

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,730
certificates or in your posting land

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,920
will be given three when I was the

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,860
provider otherwise you could always buy

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,930
and if you need help you can either

00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,180
contact the support of your hosting

00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,430
provider to kind of assist you or if you

00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,090
oxygen you could just go ahead to do it

00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:07,070
by yourself so the next number to do is

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:14,930
I'm going to be installing WordPress

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:18,770
so let's come here so I thought about

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:22,610
Maeda by some organizations so like

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:27,080
streets themselves like I think against

00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:31,040
SSL's the survey that organizations that

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,230
actually sell as substitute games so you

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,820
could eat away from them or you can

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,840
utilize different stuff that we can't

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:45,520
that be giving to you okay so because of

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:48,470
the time left I will just quickly

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,160
numerator how that shows how to install

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,160
what

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:05,370
so some providers and able you to so

00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,269
provided that it we need to

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:11,610
automatically install WordPress

00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:13,169
they give you like an auto installer so

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:17,610
it makes it easy for you to store

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:21,509
WordPress Wow you can download from

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:24,600
wordpress.org to manually install we can

00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:29,429
use an auto installer so right now I

00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:33,210
will be in that auto installer just

00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:34,799
straight process install now the reason

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,299
why I chose to install base itself

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,580
certificate with Warren

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:42,240
it's that impeding is easy learn to

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:45,840
installing your WordPress your lesson so

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,519
you need a 50 PS because it got me it is

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,950
more time if you have someone with you

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,870
from HGTV needs to be as I need to get

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,629
strength but if you get the foundation

00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,700
right from the onset really knows you

00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:59,190
have to do is already selected because

00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,250
an option but if it is not use it to be

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,740
still there or its to be s just use this

00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,139
and install it was installed in the

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,120
directory you would learn what I meant

00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:11,100
about the directory here by those who

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:17,009
studied any directory so I'll never

00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:21,230
reduce this so let's just move over do

00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,759
we understand okay let's just move over

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,279
so

00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:28,889
install updates what fresco make sure

00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,460
that we install WordPress of the actual

00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:32,669
sites

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,639
well Softaculous will definitely stolen

00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:38,100
the correct one

00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:40,289
if you your supervisor provided all the

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,840
tourists alike to do stuff when you

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,730
download from WordPress support now

00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,070
whatever that about updates WordPress

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,850
core most times that usually updates may

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:54,330
be because they are trying to security

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,700
patchi's or improvements enhancements

00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:01,379
and just like an operating system though

00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:04,799
that we have XP Vista 7 like that yeah

00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:07,950
so there's always improvement so you

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,499
need to update otherwise archives can

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,529
attack your sites they tend to begin to

00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:17,159
do you sports automated matches to

00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:19,259
search for versions that have corner

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,480
abilities that nobody declared and have

00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:25,139
been patched and that's why you have a

00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,690
pizza questions for you to migrate to or

00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:30,090
and updates to so if you know updates

00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,730
and those what abilities are well known

00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:35,009
I just have to do the attack as you just

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:39,720
get to search for and what flight

00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:42,090
specialist that how maybe lower versions

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,119
with no input methods inside they are

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,950
not based on this vulnerabilities so

00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,039
that's one of the reasons why it's all

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,789
things then I'm going easy have default

00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,549
values

00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:56,369
don't use the default WordPress table

00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:59,850
prefix WP you can change it you so when

00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:03,960
you're installing your WordPress site

00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:06,299
why because if they were to do some SQL

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,899
injection chord and they are trying to

00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:11,639
just guess the consensus of course into

00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,609
your database and they are using the

00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,530
default formats because there's a

00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:21,869
specific symbol names so if a easily

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,399
defaults prefix and it gets rights the

00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:24,720
damage the neck not just imputes

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,319
anything

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,300
would you know be good for your websites

00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:33,240
so avoid using default values adults

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,300
also includes using upbeat please do not

00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,280
use that mean you can pretend name okay

00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,290
knowing that make makes it easy for them

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,359
to hack in science because there

00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,849
anything sunny then all they stop

00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:48,149
stuttering is guess the password request

00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:51,569
a time now you secure passwords you can

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:55,919
make your password like twelve twelve

00:34:51,569 --> 00:35:00,690
characters mixtures or alphabets numbers

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,180
symbols avoid dictionary words because

00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:06,359
what is the language tip not make you

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,880
remember so if you are evil and you feel

00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,510
like isn't cheating game you know yeah

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,230
maybe

00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:16,020
check it is good not evil one yeah you

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:20,730
mix it or for example shaking you

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:25,109
capsules eh instead of I you use one you

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:27,839
know so instead of a you use odds words

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:29,609
that Vicki easily remember your password

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,150
because if you write the doubts on my

00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:32,700
six

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:36,420
and so many things like that so you give

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:39,390
you tips and logins of today's I really

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,040
don't obtain direct on your site I know

00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,760
you cannot attack you might just be easy

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,859
for you to do that

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,660
even if you want to do that the quickest

00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,760
way and easiest way for you to do that

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,290
was to show you back up first so use a

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,089
backup plug-in to do it back up so that

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,329
if anything were to happen you can drop

00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:59,870
back to your backup okay so that makes

00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:02,370
it easy for you

00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:05,180
these are all things we can see updates

00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:08,550
now whatever so just how you update now

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:12,720
okay so I think we'll be wrapping up

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:15,210
from here but there abouts became a way

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,820

money when your site can't hops you know

00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,480
