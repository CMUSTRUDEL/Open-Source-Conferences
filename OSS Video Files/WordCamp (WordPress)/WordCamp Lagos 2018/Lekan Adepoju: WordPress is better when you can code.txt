Description: 
	I will be sharing my experience on how learning even a little bit of code can make WordPress even easier to use as well create more unique designs and also overcome road blocks while making you productive. This talk sheds more light on why WordPress is available to all. There are a lot of people out there writing series of code to make WordPress as simple as it is and easy to use. Hence, learning to code just to make WordPress even better isnâ€™t a bad idea at all.
