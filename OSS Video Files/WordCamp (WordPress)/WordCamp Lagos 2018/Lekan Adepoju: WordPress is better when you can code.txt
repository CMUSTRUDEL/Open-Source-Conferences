Title: Lekan Adepoju: WordPress is better when you can code
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Lagos 2018
Description: 
	I will be sharing my experience on how learning even a little bit of code can make WordPress even easier to use as well create more unique designs and also overcome road blocks while making you productive. This talk sheds more light on why WordPress is available to all. There are a lot of people out there writing series of code to make WordPress as simple as it is and easy to use. Hence, learning to code just to make WordPress even better isnâ€™t a bad idea at all.

	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,410
right yeah we always use WordPress for

00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,970
me about websites look in oh I just

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,530
interested in the technology because

00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,490
it's fantastic come on

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:16,759
so basically I'm talking about how

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,890
WordPress is is to with it or it's

00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:21,199
the best forum or one of the best

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,749
performing that if you thought could you

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,759
can utilize very well this why I started

00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:29,869
to see the WordPress goes beyond

00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:32,359
creating website or written words like

00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:35,059
easily a lot of the bet on WordPress

00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,489
because it's quite easy to you know get

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,800
something quickly in a few minutes of

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,359
your sign up our onion extract a poor in

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,140
if you really love school you can go

00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,140
beyond that so

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,199
what's up T cause I saw her

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:57,559
and other more books without searching

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,719
for this presentation this is one of the

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,920
quotes is the contact Rama is a creator

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,259
of universe for which he'll the lawgiver

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,500
no clearer at no stage direction

00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:11,899
November or however powerful otherwise

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,140
aside such absolute authority to arrange

00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:18,590
the stage of field of battle at command

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,009
and such constantly beautiful actors or

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,180
troops yourself with the moment

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:27,190
basically of this government especially

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,069
saying is this difficult goal very good

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:33,380
that's what means everything here

00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:37,520
everything yes is if you can call really

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,500
cold it go to the command because I got

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,409
a can control the commands or manage a

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,509
system and you can control net access

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,679
them imagine how many people's life in

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:50,010
the culture because not many people

00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:53,160
depend on systems to isolate

00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,070
depart call this department or people to

00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,950
help people at same time as well so

00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:02,330
basically that's what I've seen

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,580
I'm gonna share my experience you guys

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,439

you know you enjoy the experience of

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,980
being able to do things really quick how

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,250
to deepen your website today like next

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,170
week the team assesses now and it's a

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,730
thing for about to finish maybe two

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,200
three depending on your studio you have

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,630
student with the Tamela has to come

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,019
finish with their HTML assesses panini

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,510
alike of its what present most of the

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,480
designer and he just go down with the

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,569
onions and then Enochs is be delimited

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,140
oh gee this is a hot water

00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:46,930
I also had let's assume Jack written for

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,150
our I open a new part-time business of

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,659
an intern Sacramento initiative

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,879
initiative moment and I tickle the itest

00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:58,049
of their website sonogram so yeah with

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:03,319
the we wanted school and on different

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:06,799
web sites one little branch website on

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,170
I bought this thing what's this thing we

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,620
had most of what I needed right and then

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,290
we saw the team sale going on video to

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:19,579
observe and then I was called me on like

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:23,390
a little go to these websites just so

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:26,060
happens participative we've done you

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,790
before you buy you look at this thing

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,620
time to old I won't charge let me go

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:39,379
through me let me try out what is the

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:43,370
Obama and it shows and she says we

00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:46,549
change it we need to look like this

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,409
Fatah site and all that so I went to the

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,800
site and I just become intimate which is

00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:53,110
unexpected

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,150
two different things and you know it's

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,110
that thing you have to put it up

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,580
laughing I just defined a lot even a

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,580
more expensive than orgasm

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,310
Frankie Mira obvious invite developers

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,490
and what with things about putting wrong

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,130
present a new opportunity I didn't go to

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,720
any school included Knox Brax sorry I

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,950
didn't tell you school to then put in a

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,190
web development or anything like that

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:22,190
but I did go to new eyes and a

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,770
familiarity to Decatur right so then I

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,590
was put into the hot damn which just

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,990
took me a second any program that does

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,480
contain networking and some other

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,540
programs to design them just across the

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,210
school is yes so our stores prospects

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,940
and well the length of is very very

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,520
important you know my lecture I would

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,390
say the lecture has artists who would

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,419
say it would have so switch to just a

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,280
series of code syntax is another name in

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,680
offices so I'm going to keep getting

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,410
problem right now it is

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,450
someone should explain how to solve this

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,980
problem in code and the problem is you

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,780
can't say she does no inclusion across

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,240
the absolute C programming where it's

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,100
like okay you have to really be up to do

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,290
this year we have to do this year that's

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,440
to be the class going on the problem is

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,560
any type of code generator gives way up

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,660
so the next thing is it is so what you

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,580
do because these things need to be

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,180
useful to know the time to think of a

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,330
plan B so you take that experience into

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,150
your WordPress file it was the theme

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,790
your community look at a search engine

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,740
you to meet up requirements that have

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,930
changed and things like that what

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,840
happens do you just give up

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,720
perhaps a Mozilla in Turkey which wants

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,530
and what is happening

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,480
or do you look for a beach walk around

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:50,680
so the you know intimate season it

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,260
is new you should be this new template

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,050
all attended as one has to follow number

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,499
now and then what we have to do what I

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,150
have to do that down and

00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:04,879
because of the things I did for the

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,300
outside the delete button we had to

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,499
redesign every day because of this

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,060
typically specially new most of the

00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:12,740
different like this result will approach

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,499
is that it's like China highlighted and

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,449
stays on one side so we have to

00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:20,509
physically redo that we walk the entire

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:23,719
CSS HTML structure we have to remove

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,180
some tax with the gravitational : over

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:31,840
and then my second experience was last

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:34,580
year for what am i somebody called me

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,650
mr. Howell together a website hunted by

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,650
gasoline webbing books you government

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,529
for your websites twice can be really

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,620
fun right later before the DUI means

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,729
that as the design is not squander what

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,779
they could be I here for

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,370
I don't work but then you know their

00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,729
clients not only you don't want to have

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,810
you and they do not join James baby come

00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,630
on

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,160
yeah so you can't quote me I said this

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,160
is what you want and I looked at it when

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,750
I say

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,990
first of all writing what's its address

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:12,060
160 pretend you know what do you want

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:14,220
the words of this image is right let's

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,860
do this to watch me then this is the web

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,720
page let's assume this is everything

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,160
like these are images and then the

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,890
football thing is the background right

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,980
so you see this is a picture of a person

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,050
and we don't want we don't want the

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,780
words that we put on those images to

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,910
appear on the person's image and during

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,750
my stance if people have never at least

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,440
their hands

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,430
we love even the images ooh dancing they

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,070
need to please to write anything

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:49,350
these are from language HTML oh yes in

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:51,870
the future we'll try painting on over

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,420
and then 30 funniest across the context

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,750
of

00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:01,740
Greece I just I just open it on Nova

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,980
tanomo saltiness and then we are in a

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,980
black

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,599
you know I am glad I let it be the

00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,830
booster and all those things were a lot

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,949
different out of us

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,499
that is I moved everything again and I

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,060
said I wish I went home to stop the

00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:22,830
fight do you know who struck me in

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,930
Cologne and then right that was ready it

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,180
was explosive not very much for

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,969
the spirit fuzzy bunny with a nicer guy

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,930
what's the public outreach workers is

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:36,510
like I don't know I love the word limits

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,579
to working on that I senators strike so

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,640
we started the key in rural parts

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:43,949
WordPress website do you mean again not

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,780
an image I don't you see John is that

00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:48,570
yeah

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,150
what's this possible of what is an

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,880
exhibit 10:30 before t1 went to don't

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,190
get these generators further if I am

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,460
pregnant was the accretes that's the

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,860
images but let me take the comment Oh

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,070
what am I trying to see I'm saying that

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,520
if we have not gonna hit right foot and

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,830
to show them what to look like if if we

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,890
are correct or if you are going our way

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:18,260
they probably we're not able to convince

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:21,480
them that it's just what I'm saying and

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,810
themes and proteins give us nditions who

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,130
are easy to pull over enhancers in

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,930
figuring how what to do and how to do it

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,930
and then given the tie ropes

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,709
how it'll decide we can get basically

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,290
what what what scene is Avila was know

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,579
what person you don't get this is of

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,579
yards okay

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:50,800
family was no TV programming language

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:56,449
physically so we all know that potent ax

00:09:50,800 --> 00:10:03,110
B what quests us is a software

00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:08,720
development process can become a

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,699
software a web give your stuff easily

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,740
while same thing if you understand the

00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:15,110
mechanics of peach if you understand

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,899
pitches what level you can will stick

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,899
your WordPress to giving the

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,180
there are times when T by people plugins

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,940
writes device is on a stop looking onion

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,240
we upload used to something things but

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,970
get in details or stuff like that and

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,070
bear in mind that like I said what best

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,560
goes beyond creating websites in every

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,410
apps beautiful apps and I think

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,790
somebody's cook on WordPress and

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,740
Internet of Things imagine you know who

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,960
knows what the types of things if you

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,090
know the fit of your hand okay if a

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,300
little being spoken in fact of these

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,720
these abilities technology to our daily

00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,920
lives

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,750
thanks Leslie welcome I know what

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,210
- means visit our own College

smartphones I get that part of Eastern

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,410
European support believers reach

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:14,360
technology to control our house where

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:17,090
our University's office appliances to

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,400
make all feeds to make a phone call from

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,320
a shop

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,060
we get our cuts accredited put on the

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,390
app so you can jump in thing like that

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,830
look our table beans you know and think

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,230
about it and I think about power

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:35,150
WordPress and see what Questacon through

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:37,730
your car is it not mine doing for a web

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:42,230
app where everyone does visa should be

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:45,920
be an awkward with free free blogs about

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,330
that and then you yes um what's a usual

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,680
person go through your car

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:54,110
Oh Mickey coffee and I okay let me take

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,350
a step back I usually show this small

00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:01,220
out there I need to create smoke making

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,870
access when you can create something

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,390
that will help you fall through your car

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,839
if you have a solid power behind that

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,190
you know this significant progress

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,200
everybody wants an easy like white with

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,540
critical difference to make things easy

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,480
for other people to make them easy for

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,480
everyone else to try easy access to

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,400
things didn't get out those who know and

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,340
you know

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,500
the first way to do stage with that is

00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,430
happening I mean we cannot see with our

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,020
mobile phones we do that

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,270
definitely some of you we need to pay

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,760
someone to greet the website and use

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,760
control every lap in my house in my

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,330
office or my child's room you know this

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,550
stuff maybe doesn't be here or you ain't

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,840
America yeah your child and you don't

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,020
want to seem to charge the quick camera

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,150
and then you have the toys around the

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,070
food and things like that does have

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,290
things around that you want to be able

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,330
to do is go to the roots of you you

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,160
can't do that from that's your living

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,160
room or from your room well yes

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,140
immediately semicolon you have the part

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,220
of an image of the buttons do certain

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,690
things maybe the videos video or kids go

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,820
back to sleep and things like that

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,990
with the push of the word sending the

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,990
what you call me

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,100
really pretty so all you do is press one

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:28,279
button attendee keeps us moving those

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,060
will be redundant in philosophy in Jesus

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,220
all I'm saying

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,920
basically I'm saying that if you can

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,320
utilize the power that WordPress has use

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:41,860
we will secrete unimaginable technology

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,860
that will be on websites and books

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,180
because all happens when your client

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:53,110
asks you for seeing some tokens and he

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:56,290
go to an interview and you just want

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,790
press society in which it will be

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,900
surprised that most of your clients know

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,060
about this than you do have a family

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,810
where your client is signing to you the

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:12,750
signature like what you want to do force

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,750
KO which is a ghost in me

00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:18,139
in some measure this is a certificate

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,350
they are critical mass I can yeah so

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,819
what I will use to kill my sight what

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,160
kind of security you know that I just

00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:28,069
push it to see how much do you for what

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,449
you are trying to say so okay then you

00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:31,670
know what we don't want to use any of

00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:39,970
the themes that are online we want you

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:43,489
to design how a new products like video

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:47,929
demo food so what about these brands are

00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:50,389
they running you cannot see one sit on

00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:53,869
down Joe because the tongue critics they

00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:56,439
will be that able to work with do not

00:14:53,869 --> 00:15:00,639
want one you that was it just wanted

00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:04,519
money I'm alright but if you are like

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,470
HTML view this CSS view you know become

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,869
below from nemesis as they come

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,619
home to JavaScript and then do it to all

00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:15,739
these forest Crips it'll help you in

00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:17,329
increasing more unique websites I was

00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,669
reading online whatever somebody said

00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,929
something about those trucks said

00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:23,010
everybody's into struck down all the way

00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:26,940
said look alike

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:30,029
and it's true I put the psiloritis an

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,180
assignment I thought so

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:35,250
it's so clear that it was a wordpress

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,779
law is it even about like WordPress and

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,060
his bootstrap I know

00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,070
a Chan who was it yang the technology

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,190
and I can't sit I didn't have to take

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,410
this off that - this is now how do we

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,600
simple like I don't go right click on

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,480
check stock school I just look at this

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,790
is the WordPress site obviously so we

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,420
need you to create distance ourselves

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,760
from bottoms and we will be able to do

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,130
that if you keep distorting teens and

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,410
did the whole employees and him in and

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,270
then I'm sorry Avila so much plugins are

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,490
technical side really slow

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:13,730
Society

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:16,520
but as possible install the original

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,520
easily plug that want but make sure it

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,530
doesn't exceed dance when it's more than

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,500
that and you have a problem usually for

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,690
blocking stuff can't do much with me

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,420
know just wanna make sure you won't be

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,040
for one beautiful block is that can do a

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,110
couple of things

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,030
in addition and also trap much as

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,850
possible if you have a pitch this year

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,430
fragile unplugging or right is system

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,440
that allow you do the activity

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:48,399
networking W

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:51,870
genistein what personal everything y'all

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,870
are not related

00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:00,719
why shouldn't I go away

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:03,719
a little this I took this wrong

00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:05,339
smashing magnetic Kong Japan Janet on

00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:09,179
board said body weights learn WordPress

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,799
be solid workers really a few tutorial a

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,309
customized a few things the company

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,279
someone hits on people and they make

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,569
ourselves an expert and that's fine they

00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,089
may know more than the average person

00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,429
but his top developer news foggy on

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,899
business and push it down with very

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,970
boundaries of what is possible

00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:29,549
the innovative Archibald's silicon it's

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,010
even demonstrated mastery he worked at

00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:35,600
it and that's the only reason why

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,310
velocity was pushing for New York

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,490
restaurant

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:44,000
for WordPress ourselves community as

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:47,750
well and legacies it's like in the

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,180
Dakotas is the water covers the water

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,250
covers will I'm an artist and the

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,460
devotees of commerce that simply does

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,360
like what the specifics try to see what

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,400
press makes

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,100
and what was usually come up soon you

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,320
know and the only thing stopping you

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,010
from crazy mind-blowing technology

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,010
my solution

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,370
Last Supper b31 breasts develop I just

00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:21,680
read websites when you come

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,900
world-class I preach worked us I

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,500
admitted food because I did it for my

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,240
bento

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,990
but everyone was fun if you have fun

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,990
help could

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:37,750
community as well then also present

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:41,050
arrests attack Sakana

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,000
anyway my point piece the illicit to

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:47,200
choose people to be awarded to be world

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,040
class this is that when I was great just

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,570
intimately I sent you to me on

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,400
everything I said the first attorney

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,610
asked me was I effectively morons

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,980
and it's like bones being tossed what

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,110
boxes apart the readiness and the

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,450
dimensional focus of being involve us

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,570
how it is to be world class is to be

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,970
ready to face challenges uninvited which

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,160
other it is and how unsanitary quitting

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,470
is easy because I'm instructed myself I

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,380
will tell you that it's possible to

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,210
learn it if you invest the time and

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,310
observation

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,310
this is also open doors for you

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,960
one of the things it does is given

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,170
moment is

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,530
do you I admit more money is people did

00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:40,310
we buy things $45 imagine and this

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,620
people brag about the video downloads

$65 next video

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,550
imagine if it was your team I was

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,370
appointed first and was put on thousand

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:53,190
times to tell them special things I

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,650
never done this you to subscribe to its

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,560
own demo fire free renewable somebody

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,630
who do you believe in over a year in a

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,620
year there will be Tony Costa market a

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,900
team is all good

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,080
it will be told to take another five

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:11,310
dollars here so hidden if other 1

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,460
million downloads 500 product becomes

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,860
next year meanwhile a lot people will

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,810
still buy the DVD nothing here we have

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,730
is free some of the people are always

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,830
come back to your site there is the

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,740
whole schematic by the thin fiber at

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,980
least 100 of them are convinced by your

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,980
team

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,539
the mantra WordPress development is -

00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:36,700
sorry to be morbid will about what best

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,559
in the field and lead in a car did you

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,230
start up for every old article apart

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,809
easier imagination I come into school

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:47,919
that's why completely whatever you want

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:50,080
event like no like that in the end is

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,940
about if you don't know how to put out

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,710
would you modify all your templates your

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,080
problems your teams to do what you want

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,539
make it better your rules are different

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,630
now some developers or WordPress people

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:04,179
don't think that issues live for a team

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,630
and ability or rules there at I should

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:10,330
look for this is for this I can't do

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,309
what you can't do but the truth is even

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,929
though you find those kind of things in

00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,400
the ends are still limitations that you

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,710
have to explain yourself

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,450
I think the opportunist

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,370
and you don't want to exhaust a contain

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,320
everything like that because sometimes

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,750
it doesn't notice it when you're clearly

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,409
only website right now and a few issues

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,109
and have to call someone and say

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:32,909
then help me out I'm trying to unravel a

00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:34,529
key critical because I'd reconfigurable

00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:37,379
I haven't figured out what strong in the

00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:41,309
original code I'm like nothing is wrong

00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:43,019
when you decide to pull up the details

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:45,659
about putting the drugs decreases from

00:21:43,019 --> 00:22:03,210
banks for if you keep push not it on you

00:21:45,659 --> 00:22:05,339
you try fresh ice so as to cost

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,479
somewhere like that what lies before I

00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:09,330
give me cheese we go

00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:10,169
and she goes do ya nice front end like

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,149
prison

00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:16,379
it's nothing when you start out that's

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:18,269
why I said you know she I call Anna like

00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:20,039
will help me help me do this and then

00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,369
she fixed the first problem like two

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,089
hours

00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:27,580
I like what happened I would not like to

00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:30,369
decide who gets it

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,100
that mystic you think that you see when

00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:35,200
I was really good and they should know

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,869
something else now and you know just a

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,869
shitty power trash talking about

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,870
she said I said

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,110
without an air power as I have spent at

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,690
the template they giveth

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:55,610
I give drone use these directly

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,890
space-efficient two hours in every day

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:00,740
just traffic right now and then it in

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,890
terms of I'm sure italic new homes are

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,200
being killed something because of the

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,410
amount of hours that I spent on it just

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,690
to fix I think the very problem

00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,420
is not responsive and then the thing

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,870
that is in it as well the ways this

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,490
place because Papa is not responsive or

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,730
is a response within the temple our

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,980
table and our tables for good ability

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,820
very responsive when it comes to mobile

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,040
to our children and that means to a

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,680
facebook like design the way to do

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,890
static of our mobile we are at the

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,790
your address on won't mind to exhibit it

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,770
without Betty

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:44,020
becomes this really special this

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,300
resolution strain smoke so you can't

00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,550
imagine the power of couldn't she didn't

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,440
have to do all present inertia to also

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,930
look into my cPanel or

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,890
- mighty lady to understand a few things

00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,890
and Wow

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,260
gets the best clients but if you have

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,930
dynamic looking websites yeah it will

00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,840
still be menu bar on spider but then

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:13,020
your manual has a bit of design it's not

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,380
the regular fitted in no transparency

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:18,360
either you have like a logo that doesn't

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:23,140
still we have our example something I

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:26,140
drop some of the jobs we do

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,309
Java class on boots together and then on

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,179
the slide as well

00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:33,940
oh you have a little Street blood of

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:36,760
whites that is stop son

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:40,660
we have any coast towards the top know

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,179
things that you know CSS genius the

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,549
atomic script be able to do by yourself

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:49,090
and make it look more nice and if people

00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:52,510
see us as I suppose we can make me

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,920
different I don't want to I guess I've

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,340
known and they are looking at different

00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,770
different things that that blue that my

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,510
giving the change give adapter because

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,429
real value to something that is

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,370
different for every other night in stone

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:09,010
as well as big grandiose Hannah and wore

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,149
those interpret words that we can start

00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,649
from

00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:13,359
what'll it means that you knew it

00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,219
Randolph Randolph is a second that

00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,589
website you go to somebody website and

00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:19,299
once I talk to you of them elected by

00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:21,659
for my personal business purposes

00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:21,659
alright

00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:26,080
20 tragedy versus protein bar being

00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:30,340
diluted presents

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,230
they put a man alive and then they won't

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,159
release inside because they won't use

00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,159
them because the way

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,340
and lately have the most influence being

00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:43,049
at the top means you have different

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,440
responsibilities ability to shape the

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:47,630
future of what weighs a lot the opposite

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,960
that's too terrible basically one

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:54,260
species you got what you do

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,020
who identify you and did you know who

00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,680
you teach for that since I saw us help

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:03,020
without ceasing CD music material using

00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:10,280
the platform that you use as well as any

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:12,170
who you to to to go to return to the

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,200
community or give back to the community

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,720
and also because WordPress is such a

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,790
large community you can see everybody

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,400
get they were like brother and sisters

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,620
because of workers because here were

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,770
able to share I hear and talk about our

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:30,620
problems as developers and finance our

00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,840
solutions and because yeah good at what

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,970
you do what we potential come to you and

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,270
it gives you the gift of mentor you know

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,270
does

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:43,130
and then we'll work with readable code

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,930
I'm glad we can become easily like I

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,150
mean somebody had to write in there is

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,160
damage out of food so if you are say

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:51,680
maybe for good because so many of our

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,230
very easier for you when not to talk to

00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,240
any community and develop more about

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,700
customer data for others

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,620
whoo calculator or younger people so

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,930
they can have a platform to start

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,080
letting us do these things

00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:11,230
obviously that WordPress uses its PHP

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:15,430
javascript HTML CSS these are these are

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:19,460
not will DiMarco macaques DISA the DISA

00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:22,790
papaya which is beauty and GS if you

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,440
if you if you know all this then beyond

00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,570
your experience of developer in

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,690
WordPress and understand about crazy

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,420
website - Martine supplement as

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,970
and they know liquidator well this is

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,500
basically Jesus as a classical Cody come

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,060
up it's two workers they mix the

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,760
operators phone yeah

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,530
Mithra welcome is the team of people

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,480
from all around the world committing

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,890
certain projects on press we get from

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,660
this every time time you don't know

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,020
where those workers are coming from they

00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,850
all perform make the progress of home

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,800
people spend our time and energy sit

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,140
down to think about the program staff we

00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,360
will face our developers and traffic

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,810
those projects if you commit Stockton

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,700
Sacramento State listen to that

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,680
to learning more about be here to

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,920
develop they talk WordPress develop our

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:15,450
my time is also particle at any time I

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:17,410
think that Japanese for taking damage
