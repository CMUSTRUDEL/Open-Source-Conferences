Title: Alejandro Senese: Demystifying SSH
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Manchester 2018
Description: 
	SSH is a powerful tool that gives us an easy way to deploy our code and access to our remote server.
We will have a simplified overview of how it works and how to set it up.
After we got familiar with SSH, weâ€™ll have a look at how we can benefit from using SSH and some WordPress tool that use it.

hi everyone I'm going to talk about SSH

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,940
what is SSH how does work what we can do

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,920
and some useful tools before 13 my name

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,580
is Alessandro I'm a lead developer at

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,730
the digital WordPress agency based in

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,509
London and on Twitter and github you can

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,499
find this right after the talk so what

00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:31,189
is this Sh

00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:33,230
from the Wikipedia SSH secure socket

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,690
shell is a network protocol that

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,600
provides administrators with a secure

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:42,140
way to access arm of the computer so

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,700
what would this means something like

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,840
that miss well this is your SSH make

00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,420
sure that nobody can spy what you doing

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,400
so in order to find up a secure way to

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,570
communicate with our server we need to

00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,840
encrypt our data

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:03,530
the first encryption algorithm we see is

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,579
the symmetric one this one uses the same

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,759
key to encrypt a decrypted data a simple

00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:14,749
example is assigning a number to each

00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:19,729
symbol for example 1 2 A 2 B 3 2 D a so

00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:24,530
on so consider this ciao this our

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:28,159
audition text we applied the key we get

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:32,749
our cipher text we apply the same key we

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:36,399
get back the original test as you said

00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:39,799
yeah that's the same key this quite fast

00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,869
the problem we have here is sharing the

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,280
key because anyone that knows the key

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:49,759
will be able to see our message another

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,909
one is the asymmetric this one uses two

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,899
different keys to encrypt the decrypted

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:59,209
data so using the same example here we

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,740
can see that this one and this one are

00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:08,140
different the same key cannot be used to

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:11,620
decrypt and encrypt a decrypt the data

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,510
but they're also they are complementary

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,720
the difference with the symmetric one is

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,120
that this one is a slower

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,879
public-key encryption is a system where

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,069
we need to generate a key pair the first

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,390
one the first key is called public key

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:32,630
and we can share with anyone the second

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,900
key is the private key

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,930
we must keep secret because anyone that

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:43,560
has access to the private key will be

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:47,660
able to encrypt the decrypt the message

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,080
used with the public one

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,569
so yeah in the it's upload before the

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,709
the key we used they are just the public

00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:03,569
and private key this system is used by

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:08,610
SSH and HTTPS and there are several

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:11,940
encryption a symmetric algorithm so how

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:16,860
does SSH work basically when we do run

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,720
the command SSH both the our computer

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,069
and the server day we start to negotiate

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,230
a session use the asymmetric algorithm

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,319
so the first part is done with a

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,790
symmetric they do agree on which

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,670
symmetric algorithm to use and this

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,299
approach generate a sesame Turkey they

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,120
that only they know so the first part is

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,730
a symmetric also they carry on with

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,310
symmetric just because it's faster to

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:53,040
use also sometimes can happen the

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:56,250
keyring if you stay connected to log you

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,940
reach the maximum data that you can

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,730
transfer then we start to generate a new

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,849
symmetric key because the symmetric

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:10,079
algorithm it's secure as long as you

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:12,420
don't use for a long time there was my

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:19,320
reaction when I figure out what was

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:22,710
going on so how would you rate the now

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,180
we saw how SSH work let's see how we can

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,590
create our keys the comedy community

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,010
uses SSH key

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,610
here there are two useful parameters the

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:41,790
first one specify the top of a symmetric

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:45,550
algorithm to use in this example is RSA

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:49,540
we can choose between different there

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:56,080
are the enough for example DSA is it the

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:57,580
same as Oh on the point is before up

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,380
choose a different one make sure that

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,700
either your client at your server

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,900
support them the second parameter is the

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,930
side of the key we want to generate this

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:16,180
one also depends by the type of a

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:19,120
symmetric algorithm we wanna use yeah

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:23,400
yeah RSA is still considered strong is

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,020
still used nowadays and how I said

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:33,130
different one might be not supported by

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:36,180
the server or the client so why we

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:39,760
choose four times four thousand and six

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,150
because some version about RSA has been

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,410
broken in the past years for example the

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,390
five seven six

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:52,630
in 2003 the seven six eight in 2009 the

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,930
thousand twenty it has not been

00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:00,600
popularized yet as far as we knew this

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:04,000
might happen so now the standard is the

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:09,670
2048 so if you want to attack in use at

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,590
least 2048 we just choose for for trans

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:18,760
analysis just because better is double

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:24,040
size okay now that's that's the first

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:27,430
the once we we run the command we be

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,760
asked which where to save the the key

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,400
which for name that's up totally to you

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:37,120
were to save which filename you can go

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,040
with the default one you can also

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,430
generate a different key for different

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,980
services or if you want to keep your

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,530
company and

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:50,050
dramatically separate it's really up to

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,050
you there is no rule here

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:58,430
another thing we be asked is the protect

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,570
protecting SSH key how many of you

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,690
already use SSH and how many use a

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,080
passphrase meters say SSH okay that's

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,830
good

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,960
so a basic advantage as we see it the

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,970
practically we must keep secret because

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:21,380
anyone that as it will be able to to spy

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,660
on us basically when we use a pacifist

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:28,670
we basically encrypt our private key

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:31,550
using an aes algorithm so if for some

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,940
reason someone is able to access to the

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,850
file

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:41,180
they won't be able to use it unless they

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:44,330
also know the passphrase the primary

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,430
here is if you lose the or I forgot a

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,440
pass face you won't be able to use your

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,710
own key as well so you need to chain it

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:55,760
anyone but also you can change the

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:59,780
password in the future if you want also

00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,030
Alan is that now we protected what our

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,310
private key means that every time we

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,960
want to use our private key we need to

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,520
insert the password it is might be

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:16,850
frustrating sometimes during the day if

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:19,940
we don't remember Phil likely SSH gives

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:24,170
us powerful tool is called assistive

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:29,720
agent this tool just hold the private

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:32,420
key for us the the hold the private key

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,870
in memory does not store the private key

00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,900
anywhere does not write in the disk the

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:43,790
the keys are not shared with any current

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:46,400
programs a operation that requires the

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,340
public the private key for either

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,930
encrypt or decrypt data will be handled

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:56,960
by the SSA agent and the communication

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,080
happens by a socket socket is us

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,850
a file in the UNIX system it's used to

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,210
allow a two different application to

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:10,250
communicate between them also with SSH

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:14,480
you can add or if you have multiple key

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:17,210
you cannot all of them and SSH will

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,850
figure out which one to use when you

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:26,870
using SSH so to start the agent that's

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:32,690
the commodity unit run and also you need

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,520
to add your private key and in this case

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,850
you'll be asked to is at password and

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:42,980
that will be the only time until you

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:48,770
reboot your system okay now let's see

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:51,770
how we can use SSH to SSH is very easy

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,920
you just need SSH which you you said you

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:58,490
try to login on the server the domain or

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,190
the IP address and once you login you

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,950
will see something like that depends by

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:09,710
the server you log a log in which shell

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:12,560
is configured so what we can do with SSH

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,540
basically we can install application on

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,200
the server we can configure the remote

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:22,160
server but something very useful is

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,520
manage files and folders for example a

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,310
problem with SFTP is that if you try to

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,270
delete a huge number of files is very

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:34,010
slow you don't have a disagreement with

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,070
SSH because basically you're running a

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,920
command on the server set way also if

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,500
you need to upload a lot of files can be

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,870
can take a long time so you can easily

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,270
deep you can just upload the zip file

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:51,350
and once you log 18 on the server you

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:53,300
can unzip or you can make a deep of the

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,600
files on the server and easily download

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:59,630
them and this is very useful yeah you

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,050
can do backup you can modify files on

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:06,770
the file on the server sometimes you can

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,440
you or save access to the database so

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,579
you can use my support dump to adapt the

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,869
base of my sick

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:17,239
to import the bass also another useful

00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:22,670
thing is can be used to deploy your

00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:26,989
local code a lot more one of the tools

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:31,129
is RC is arsing is a fast versatile

00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:34,459
remote and local file copying tool it's

00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:36,619
very powerful and you can easily sync

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:39,499
whatever your local for their own the

00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:41,869
server some useful option is that you

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:45,199
can only think what has been changed to

00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:49,819
a locker what is does not exist on the

00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:51,769
server and you can use the same to do to

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,649
pull the data from the server the other

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,499
province is rather easy to know very

00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:02,029
easy to use but likely there are plenty

00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:05,480
of tutorials on our own internet other

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:07,339
Wally it's a SCP this one I usually use

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,679
when I need to just copy a file or

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,360
folder because this syntax is easier

00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:16,309
there is really not much to remember

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,230
also we are both press developers and we

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:21,439
have this powerful tool is called word

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:25,129
move this one basically under the hood

00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:27,290
use a sink but the configuration is just

00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:30,850
a plain text file where you configure

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:34,249
the your local pass the remote path and

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:37,009
you can pull a push plug-in upload

00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:43,910
folder and theme and we use our sing and

00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:46,549
SSH for you another situation might be

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,399
useful if you need to copy data from

00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:51,769
several days to several be and assume

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,899
that we have access to both from our

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:58,299
computer the problem they cannot

00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:02,410
communicate the director with sever beam

00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:06,850
so we cannot transfer directed the files

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,369
so we should log log in and the server

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:16,220
copy the files download upload on server

00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:18,470
B and to do the copy other option might

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,600
be created the key on the once ever

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,090
authorize the keys on the other server

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,470
and vice versa

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,610
and this will allowed them to

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,310
communicate not likely

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:35,270
SSH gives you gives us another tool is

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:38,240
called SSH a Jennifer boarding this

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:43,610
basically allows us to use to forward

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,030
our ancient our local SSH keys to the

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,940
server so in this situation basically

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,970
what we need to do is we forward our

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,150
agent to a sever a limb and now from

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,880
severed a we'll be able to connect to

00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:02,180
sever be or just use one of the tools I

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,690
said before from serve a date to serve a

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,670
B so suppose if you to do a migration

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,940
you can forward the key on my server and

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,030
use our thing to migrate WordPress and

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,940
everything you need on there everyone

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:18,980
also SSH can be used to you can be

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,870
chained so you came forward from Sevilla

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:27,050
to say baby and so on so on so on and to

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:32,420
use it's very easy it's just you need to

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:37,310
append the shape to the SS command or

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:42,350
you can configure the you can put the

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:46,220
contribution in the sssh config the

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,880
problem here is for anyone that on the

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,130
server you forward the key that is

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,730
sufficient a permission like admin like

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:58,160
root then we table to be use your agent

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:03,050
so don't just forward all the time just

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:07,930
do if you really need so as we say to

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,930
you we can loop infinitely the for body

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:18,710
so yeah the that's all remember where

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:21,080
you have a SSH access on some pay and

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,660
must give you admin access and if you

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,340
mess up the server might be a problem

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,720
especially if you don't have a physical

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,700
access to it

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,380
you'll not be able to do to access

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,920
anymore and here very some useful

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,650
resource

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:41,810
the first two are this

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:44,750
so you see you with RSA works the third

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:49,910
one is a bit more in-depth with a real

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:52,970
example about the the algorithm the SSH

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,580
by Michael is about the the server

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,610
security implication and if you want to

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:37,390
configure your own server and respond is

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:39,650
what moved now in the zone Mike I

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:43,670
haven't used for a long time

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,830
I mean if you stole SS OpenSSH is the

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:51,830
most popular improvisation which should

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:55,400
be will you get the yeah but you should

00:16:51,830 --> 00:17:00,820
be able to use SSH or you can use the is

00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:03,860
there is a UI is called the PU TT y

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,840
airport a you can try that one I don't

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,800
see why you should have a problem

00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,800
between us anyway

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,060
yeah it's just gonna mention that

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,770
there's now a Linux sub system for

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,540
Windows 10 I think I don't think it was

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,310
for the old ones but gives you yet

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,680
access to those I think it's based on up

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,720
onto so you can't get out it's a bit

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:43,220
slightly tricky with multi buddies does

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:47,320
work because if you don't like petit

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:53,630
this a terminal called hyper much nicer

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:55,520
any questions from the audience we can

00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:21,080
talk about different terminal things all

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:24,080
day like you said you know it's more a

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,430
security implication because some like

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:32,240
the 576 has been broken the thousand 24

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:34,990
just because the computational power our

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,300
machine is getting bigger a bigger and

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,120
we know how to break RSA the problem is

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,240
that is not doable because if you want

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,460
to break the 4096 you you need years a

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,070
lot of years that's the problem we have

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,100
we know how to do it but we cannot do

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,800
that because it's not doable so at the

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,800
bigger number you use the the last

00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:04,670
chance that your key can be can be

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:07,940
broken that that's all I think there is

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,530
a limitation by your client and your

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,140
server not sure about that but I think

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:17,650
there are limit that your machine cannot

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,650
support higher but not sure about that

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,519
any other questions

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:37,430
we are just being really shy and you

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,500
know how people say oh you should have a

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,690
longer stronger password archer

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,160
cybersecurity people always go well

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:47,510
other conference they were like if we

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,050
start doing 50 character passwords then

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:53,000
it speeds up the hackers to like try and

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,180
break the 50 security faster so they

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,040
were like please just do like a sensible

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,660
amount so that we have longer to take

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,790
and I think it's the same with there so

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,130
just a tip you you briefly mentioned the

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,060
config file in an SSH folder which is

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,770
really useful

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,810
if you've got a lot of different

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,570
connections using different key files

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,300
because you don't have to specify which

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,980
key files so in the config file you can

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,690
say for this server you use this key

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,000
file for this server use this key file

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,790
that's I find that really useful because

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,710
if you get too many and you let it try

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,540
and work out which one to use you can

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,730
run out of attempts and get locked out

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:36,520
with your own server been there done

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:39,940
that not good like anyone else had SSH

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,640
woes should we have a bit of a

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:49,700
heart-to-heart right now oh we have one

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:53,690
up there it's not a question it's more

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,140
of a similar thing yeah so if you're

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,540
trying to connect via SSH and it's not

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,090
something that you used to and that

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:06,830
command at the beginning was like SSH

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:08,840
user at host specifying the port number

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,420
can be useful because it might you might

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,310
need a two or two or and otherwise you

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,640
might not be able to get in so which can

00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,480
be frustrating if you don't know it been

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,500
there done that

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,150
got a badge

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:27,720
I feel like it's like a budget

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:29,670
reflection day does anyone have any

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:39,030
favorite as I change things they like to

00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:42,180
do I did our - all my machine that was

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:45,860
not fun and it's slash cuz I thought it

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,860
meant that folder and I realize actually

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,230
permissions doesn't grant it you can't

00:21:50,760 --> 00:22:03,390
just go into leaked things like that

00:21:52,230 --> 00:22:06,180
with sorry I want it you are logging in

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,560
brand new commands you can screen so if

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,450
you connection drops the command will

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:15,930
still run or wise it'll drop your

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:17,580
connection Alessandra do you have any

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,160
favorite things that you like to do with

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,330
like SSH and terminal anything that you

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,430
wish like your past self used to know I

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:29,250
use a lot because I connect to the

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:32,970
remote server a company that's why I you

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,680
know enough or sad I use no standard

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:41,640
port so I need to use the - P parameter

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:44,220
well also I had to migrate website few

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,250
months ago from two different server

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,310
luckily I had SSH access so I did the

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:53,010
migration between Iran I did the racking

00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:56,970
for hours we will try to use a plug-in

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,370
was exterminated like 16 hours I did the

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,010
same with Justin for hours and

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,380
eventually just because we we did like a

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,720
first migration to test if was working

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,740
so we had to the real migration real

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,820
migration are just using rsync I just

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,730
uploaded the new the fact that we're

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,860
having was changed on the fire I didn't

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,260
I had to do everything from scratch to

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,620
collect ten minutes so can be very

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,620
useful

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:32,179
but you had a PV do no any point put

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,309
your hand up if you do I do pop out if

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:37,160
you like do you have it do you use

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,720
anything like her scripts or like double

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:44,300
PC a line when you're a sensation

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:47,330
pitching know I use the word move I've

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:50,150
used double PC right but just to create

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:54,500
a wordpress is so locally never with SSH

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:57,830
so no not too much what does anyone here

00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:05,320
know what WC is or doesn't know what W

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:07,640
is does anyone need an explanation cool

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,160
so yeah some people not have their heads

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,390
there so don't be silly is WordPress on

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,740
the command line

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:17,929
WPC oh I see L I if you google that into

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,630
Google search that into any search

00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:22,340
engine of your choice it will come up

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,720
with some very useful things and it does

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,660
a really good search to a place on these

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,280
faces which is my favorite thing it
