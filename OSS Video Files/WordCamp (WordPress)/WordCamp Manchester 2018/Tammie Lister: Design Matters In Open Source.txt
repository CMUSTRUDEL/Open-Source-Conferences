Description: 
	Open source matters to the future of design. It enables more people to have access to design. Open source matters to the future of us all. Designing in open source isn’t always easy and in this talk I’ll draw on my background along with experiences in the WordPress project. What are the challenges and why does it matter to have design in open source? How can we create spaces that encourage design thinking? How can we all unite in an open source future?
