Title: Tammie Lister: Design Matters In Open Source
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Manchester 2018
Description: 
	Open source matters to the future of design. It enables more people to have access to design. Open source matters to the future of us all. Designing in open source isn’t always easy and in this talk I’ll draw on my background along with experiences in the WordPress project. What are the challenges and why does it matter to have design in open source? How can we create spaces that encourage design thinking? How can we all unite in an open source future?

so thank you the open source actually

00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,879
matters to the future of us all and

00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:15,769
design matters to open source open

00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:18,800
source as we all know it enables people

00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:21,740
to have access to both creating and

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,580
using something that is well designed

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,850
but the reality is that being a designer

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,830
an open source it isn't easy and today I

00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,379
want to really talk about why design

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,289
matters and how we can create spaces

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:40,129
that encourage design thinking then how

00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:42,050
we can all unite together open source

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,969
simply / tonie's designers and this

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,710
isn't me just saying it because I'm a

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,679
designer

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:51,829
it truly does need design to be has a

00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,719
very heart of the project and design

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,909
when I say it like this isn't just a

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,940
role either I'm going to kind of get you

00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:01,489
back in this talk and this goes beyond

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,859
making something just look good good

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:06,950
design and a healthy design community is

00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:09,079
at the heart of successful projects and

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,049
all those roles combined to really make

00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:15,710
a powerful force and they complete the

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,049
universe there are a lot of problems

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,380
when a design is actually missing in a

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:25,369
project and one of those is the lack of

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,039
user voice and Trust is broken in a

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:32,899
project that doesn't put care respect

00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:34,850
and thought at the very heart of it you

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:38,450
can tell a project and we all know this

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,979
that has design acts the final point of

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,119
sign up I'm sure you've all experienced

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,509
the project where you just like well

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,729
that was just applying design at the end

00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:49,130
that has just designers coloring or

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,950
deciding a form not engaged in the

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,899
process and designers on a color palette

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,630
and they're not a checkbox either for a

00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:58,490
product those focusing on design can

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,689
benefit a project in many different ways

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,719
and understanding and empathy is

00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:07,969
generally the tools of a designer they

00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,190
can bring those to the community as well

00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:12,560
in open source

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,550
accessing design it allows you to pan

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,990
out and see a whole entire project

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,990
designing the actual community itself

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,340
it's often easy to get obsessed about

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,470
once we do this fact we have a developer

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,970
track a designer track we split our

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,980
workouts into tracks we see that our

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,990
teams in two different roles as well and

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,960
even in this talk already I've said the

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,790
word designer quite a few times

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,020
open-source often attracts hybrids and

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,930
this is actually something we should

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,000
embrace and we should encourage you

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,730
could say world WordPress itself is

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,540
built on this principle we also often

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,300
expect

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,390
Romney in some cases a high technical

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,950
ability from our designers so this is

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,740
all about finding balance between this

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,270
being open to blowing and hybrids but

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,760
being open to anyone that wants to

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,730
specialize or wants to perfect in a

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,010
particular field because yes most will

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,020
identify with one more or the other but

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,990
as a project we have to level up design

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,050
beyond just one role and we have to be

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,090
careful of dismissing opinion but also

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:21,050
respectful of those that are making this

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:24,440
their career path there's the popping

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,930
though being a designer as I said if I'm

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,700
honest and open source today isn't

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,550
easier and I say this from my heart

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,980
it's hard working in the open every

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,720
single person has an opinion and every

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,239
single person has a very loud design

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,030
opinion auxin design is on the front

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,320
line and designers are as a result they

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,209
feel both good and bad directly we

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,430
create from a heart and because we do

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,800
that we try and retrain in empathy a

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,200
times been an open source project is far

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,930
from nurturing or recharging for us as

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,180
an experience those that people

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,680
tirelessly working can feel themselves

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,840
drained reduced in some cases pixel and

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,300
have polishes and pushes around and

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,580
that's no way to treat a designer the

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,519
design voice is often a less space is

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,810
given quieter and often an open source

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,150
project it's far from quiet my journey

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,240
in open source like many designers

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,610
hasn't been easy there's been ups and

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,400
I worked as a contributor my own time

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,340
I'll surround my own business and

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,900
recently before my recent well I balance

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,150
being a contributor with working

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,920
full-time and it's only been the past

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,720
few years that I've got to really be

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,510
donated full-time back to the project

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,640
it's a long journey and right now only a

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,350
handful of single digit designers are

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,540
able to be donated full-time to the

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,950
project and if you compare that or

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,110
balance that with developers and

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,830
overalls originated back to the project

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:56,470
it really doesn't balance out but I

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,120
don't want to turn bleak but every

00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,980
single designer in this project will

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,490
have at some point thought is it worth

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,760
it because the fact is it's not easy and

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,260
it's often harder than it should be

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,150
don't get me wrong contributing is a

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,160
hard process for every single person

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,190
that does it and that public sense of

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,230
roles in fact it does but there's that

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,140
layer that is sometimes oppressive for a

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,080
designer you're working in a system a

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,740
maze that's really designed to be solved

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,370
by a developer nothing seems to fit when

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,280
you're trying to work the feedback

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,070
firehose but that's easy to drown out

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,460
any form of creativity that you have and

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,830
meet your own design voice when everyone

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,130
has an opinion space for yours seems

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,830
really really hard to find even the lead

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,750
developer notion that we use in its a

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,800
cornerstone of a project that's broken

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:57,220
for designers exclusion means everywhere

00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,640
and anyone wanting to actually level up

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,200
in this role sees that we need to change

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,940
that and I feel that we are changing

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,960
that and that's kind of part what I want

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,120
to discuss today but there are times

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,760
it's incredible so I don't want to kind

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,230
of kind of paint it completely as

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,530
negative there are times when it's

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,750
amazing the the fact your work can be in

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,750
a product so wildly used is thrilling

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,360
that first time you see your design work

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,069
live on someone's sites and far back in

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,919
a cafe

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,589
that moment or that time you hear

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,999
someone who's saying that they changed

00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,909
their life because it's something that

00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:38,159
you made in WordPress that's really

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:41,399
incredible every little one of these

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:44,369
successes adds up the little ones the

00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,619
first commit the first names recognition

00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,629
the first time you're asked for your

00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:51,569
opinion as a designer in court app

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,119
that's a big one for any designer that

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,330
time you became a team rep at that time

00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:59,669
we designed led a project every single

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:04,559
little success adds up and keeps you

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,689
moving the project and as I said

00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:09,059
open-source matters for design outside

00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:11,999
of WordPress as well because closed

00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:15,710
systems available only to use those that

00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:18,899
have money that's not good for design

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:22,169
and by its very nature the true concept

00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:24,119
of open source works for design many

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,119
companies are recognizing this and

00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:29,189
WordPress has a long history of enabling

00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:32,399
people no matter what level the

00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:33,990
designers to join and learn and level up

00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,729
for contributions and it's not just

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,589
designers we do this with people have

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,539
come to the project learned the skill

00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:42,779
and then been able to make a career out

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:44,699
of it an experienced designers also

00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,319
gained through contribution takes them

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,019
out of their space shows them a world

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,729
and exposes them to really exciting

00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:56,059
things the problem though with most

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,800
projects is their track the same people

00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:01,949
this also can go beyond countries to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,199
accessibility and diversity as well even

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,139
a project that attracts designers does

00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,990
not mean that it has this solved at all

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,949
maybe it's just actually attracting one

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,439
particular type of designers this still

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:19,259
is not good and it's a challenge but

00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,839
it's one incredibly worth pursuing by

00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,330
having a wide range of really different

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,569
designers you end up with a rich deep

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,269
pool to create from and this can only be

00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,459
a good thing for the project if we truly

00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,450
want inclusive design we actually need

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,930
designers of

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,090
types the shear costs and access to

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,669
design products often actually rules

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,320
that out for designers and open-source

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,110
can change it's through the tools that

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,710
we have recently we've within WordPress

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,570
had access to an envision license and

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,090
things like this for the design team

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,620
really changed the way that we can start

00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:00,720
giving people these tools to work with

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,150
if only a handful that a privileged work

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,740
on WordPress then we actually design

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,600
with bias and that's not a healthy

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,090
project so I don't if you've heard this

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,880
word design infusion but design infusion

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:18,420
is about making everyone in the project

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,130
aware and activated on design and whilst

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,840
this notion of design and fusion is

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,390
something people say a lot I actually

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,700
tend to think of it as design activation

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,010
because to me imp users a little bit

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,780
passive I drink a lot of tea so I think

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,440
about the tea bag it doesn't really do

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,930
much it just infuses so activation is

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,800
when actually action happens it's

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,690
actually doing something about it and

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,840
how does this help well

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,990
it means your scarce resource of design

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,540
suspends the spreads far greater it

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,610
means that those designers get to focus

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,150
on the important work and don't have to

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,860
focus on being and doing everything this

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,210
is particularly important for developers

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,900
as they can actually guide their own

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,640
work if you design activate a developer

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,940
you really enable them to not be just

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,470
checking in constantly with designers

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,990
you get them to be able to make these

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,090
decisions and I'm not saying to remove

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,220
designers completely just make sure I

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,590
haven't gone too far over there what I'm

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,630
saying is it's about protecting and

00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:25,650
using the valuable resource that we have

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,790
a design activated community runs deeper

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,460
than just the roles that I'm

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,460
communicating it's empathic with

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,580
experience at its real core and the

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,940
voice of the users shout across from

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,490
every single corner of the project

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,340
design activated developers I actually

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,160
think of the future I'm kind of the

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,900
first thing we need to do designers

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,840
often as I said in this project is

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,280
scarce community commodity and that

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,980
becomes a problem and we force them to

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,750
ruin everything when we do this to

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,390
developers with design some of that

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,820
burden gets spread and develops become

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,510
empowered and when I was saying they're

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,740
just not handing over that work and that

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,490
conversation starts to happen and that's

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,860
incredibly important ideas generate and

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,690
this incredible work flow across from

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,970
both between both roles starts to happen

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,220
and then other roles join in and you get

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,020
this great big design conversation

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,630
that's not just limited to a tiny role

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,220
of designers this truly is where

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,070
exciting things can happen in a

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,290
community and when a good first pass can

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,340
be made in patches once the developer

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,260
activates the design this saves time

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,090
issues can be iterated by expressing in

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,070
design when you expensive visually

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,130
conversation is very easy across

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,900
different countries as well and I've

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,820
seen this happen with buin burg I've

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,370
been lucky to see many examples where

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,290
developers have suggested something

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,720
explored experimented have that freedom

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,060
and then designers have worked with them

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,950
and similarly designers if they wanted

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,630
to remember we shouldn't force anyone to

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,490
do anything they don't want to such as

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,890
designers been technical they've

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,560
exploded in code and that fluidity of

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,570
roles has given that space to freely

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,280
experiment and it's important to nurture

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,660
and grow as a community so I hope

00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,970
they'll show me why we need to do this

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,180
but how do you create a space that

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,430
matters how do you enable design to be

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,800
at the heart of an open source project

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:30,210
when you start simply in build up I'm

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,460
making it sound very easy respect

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,840
it's a cornerstone of this and that's

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,770
gonna sound a little bit obvious the

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,140
first thing in the morning

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,120
but we want to care about everyone right

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,249
we want everyone to feel that they

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,819
belong in the pod

00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:45,709
and that kinds of respect we have to

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:47,899
though recognize that different types of

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:49,519
people those who focus on different

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,799
roles of example or those are different

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,069
culturally may need a different kind of

00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:58,189
space and ultimately any space that is

00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:59,899
caring will be better for anyone but we

00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:02,329
had to recognize what is caring for each

00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,869
role and each person in each type of

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:08,149
human and then encourage it this knees

00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:10,850
designers from a design perspective to

00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:14,119
be heard just speak up and be allowed to

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,259
lead the idea of Archaeology is

00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,869
something I think we forget in this

00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,519
project what do I mean by that well

00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:21,619
actually researching before you suggest

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,259
something before you suggest something

00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:25,519
its archaeology time I can make it sound

00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,499
very corny but that's kind of what I

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,089
think about whenever I'm coming to

00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,619
something like attractive yet well I'm

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,439
coming to something like a github issue

00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:35,449
I want to know the context of this

00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,970
before I comment on this because then

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm going to be able to comment better

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,869
so before you suggest something if

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,149
something's Midway or being worked on

00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:46,699
investigate and say this is an exciting

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,619
part of your process if you really want

00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:50,449
to move a project on actually research

00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,860
if it's been suggested before this

00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:54,199
amazing idea that you have that's

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,699
burning in your brain and this goes even

00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,910
more for a project deeper into its

00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:00,589
lifecycle it's likely come up before and

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,269
absolutely you might have the key to

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,179
unlocking something that's been stuck

00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:06,529
for a very long time but you also might

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,399
have the key for something completely

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,949
different

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,529
and knowing and adding that context

00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,569
means that you can give that answer and

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,660
that comment in the right context and

00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:19,970
really move the project forward so I've

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,649
said it before but experimentation it's

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,720
probably the hardest thing to do because

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,179
it requires giving space and a lot of

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,149
trust and that respect again to do this

00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:30,980
but it's the biggest thing that we can

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,059
do is creating a safe space for that

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,449
within our community

00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:37,639
this is from allowing experimentation

00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:39,859
future just giving space for ideas to

00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,039
just happen those what is theirs oh

00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:44,140
those kind of ideas that seem that

00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,470
they're not going to be in

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,270
just see how far they go this is how

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,520
boundaries are pushed and the really

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,880
incredible work happens within our

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,430
community and don't worry about waiting

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,050
until it's fully formed we if you think

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,210
you've waited too long to show something

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,100
you absolutely have and if you don't

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,200
think it you absolutely have waited too

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,110
long before you show something getting

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,150
those ideas out allowing people to have

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,270
that respect to show early it's really

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,060
really important and not judging just

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,680
being open to that work as well if you

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,150
have that this kind of culture of

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,730
feedback which I'm going to discuss in a

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,160
minute we have that freedom to do that

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,940
and these ideas are going to shoot and

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,920
thrive from that another really simple

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,220
thing you can start doing even today

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,780
it's visualized everything and I'm

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,870
talking about not just adding

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,570
screenshots to poor press some issues we

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,950
use a lot of words in our project and we

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,140
use a lot of words for multicultural

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,940
project as well so we just start

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,690
communicating a little bit more visually

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,640
we can avoid some of this as well

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:56,230
designers are amazing we are incredible

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:59,230
we're also really yeah calm about what

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:02,410
we say you go wise but we are not mind

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,570
reader's and none of us are beyond this

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,670
don't really stick to words to describe

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,290
something if you're stuck and you're

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,540
having an endless conversation loop

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,680
hands up who's had one of those where

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,090
you're just all talking and worse to

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,490
each other and no one's understanding

00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,310
what you're trying to say that's the

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,470
most of the room at this point if you

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,870
start to just visualize that drawer

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,000
sketch you might think that you can't

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,890
draw but I've got news every single

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,660
person in this room can do some form of

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,700
drawing it could be shapes it could be

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,070
cutting out and pasting things together

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,340
and drawing lines over it it doesn't

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,590
matter

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,810
communicating visually means you can get

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:42,190
beyond that kind of word ping-pong that

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,720
you'll be going through and all voices

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,150
really need to be heard I said this a

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,220
few times but it's so important goes to

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,350
that culture of feedback that I alluded

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,170
to that needs to be cut

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,420
faded space should be created and the

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,040
community shouldn't be just focusing on

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,830
who is shouting the loudest and I think

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,230
we do that sometimes feedback needs to

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,940
be learn it's actually an art that it

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,160
should be practiced by everyone in the

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,650
community it's a skill that we all need

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,830
to learn and we all need to really

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,440
really practice daily a community's

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,830
ability to give feedback or not is

00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,480
really a good indication of its health

00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:22,150
and when a healthy feedback culture

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,220
exists every single voice flourishes in

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,940
it and it's heard and what I mean by

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,860
this is not that just that's positive

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:32,320
unicorns and bunnies moving and happy

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,380
flowers everywhere feedback a good

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,750
feedback culture gives critical feedback

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,670
is feedback that can be patient doesn't

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,330
just say everything is sunshine and

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:46,360
amazing actually moves on feedback that

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,430
is just purely positive it's pretty much

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,900
as bad as feedback that is just

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:54,610
dismissive respect when you do this

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,870
that's a flow to the community and that

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:01,240
cornerstone is established so we expect

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,550
also designers to do a lot of roles and

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,770
we have this really scarce resource and

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,840
this goes for anyone that is a leader in

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,850
our project at the moment just like

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,830
designers they're scarce and this is

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,110
really a wrong way an approach to do

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,720
this to people we need to create a

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,190
community and tools where designers can

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,140
thrive I have myself felt this self an

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,790
outside pressure to do all the things I

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,500
think anyone within WordPress has felt

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,540
that we feel that we should be

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,510
everything we can be and give everything

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,240
of ourselves to the project but we have

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,920
to change this and we can't just regards

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,200
the design and we shouldn't just

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,090
teleport loaded designers in and say

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,900
that's done because that doesn't really

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,820
solve anything

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,390
numbers that solve anything this is a

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,390
community and a project change how did

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,580
the answer is that design activation but

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,070
the other part is recognition a lot of

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,000
the work designers and other Wells do is

00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:00,070
invisible and that has to change

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,960
as a project we need to make visible all

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,670
the work that at the moment is just

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
happening and we're exactly that's

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,570
happened and you probably don't even

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,590
know that happens and really recognize

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,790
that because a good community for design

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,370
is actually a good community for

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,620
everybody I don't say this casually

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,240
because it's important to know and what

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,260
do I mean by that cuz that's quite a big

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,740
statement right

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,320
we often the very things that designers

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:29,050
5in mean that anyone is gonna thrive in

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,890
a community needs to give space for

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:35,620
voices how do you actually start by

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,240
having this good community well there

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,300
were a few ways and I'd like to share

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,820
those at the moment we have a design

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,190
team and that's a start and that's one

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,660
that we have only if you think about the

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,400
length of the projects it's been quite a

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,080
long time for WordPress and it's

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,720
something that we've only had really

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,830
strongly for a few years

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,060
designers need to be in all areas and

00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:00,040
united's supporting each other in those

00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,180
recently the design meeting changed to

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,090
try and include more people from

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,370
different time zones and the Japanese

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,110
design community now have added their

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,100
notes to the weekly posts that's a

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,570
really great thing they're having their

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,090
own meeting in their own language and

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,070
then adding their notes and all of this

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,440
really adds up to being a more open for

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,990
everyone these delicate small little

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,350
steps are really really important the

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,660
culture of the project now this is a

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,480
binary view as many of the people blur

00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,270
amazingly into different roles but this

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,990
is all those identified as designers in

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,700
the last point release since someone

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,850
like you doing something high up in

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,110
WordPress actually matters I will that

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,910
there are several people that fall into

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,410
multiple different roles and also into

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,600
different roles I haven't highlighted

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,150
like support and editorial again these

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,240
need more people as well to just have

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,000
one person representing one big type of

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,950
role within the community but designers

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,360
haven't always had this either with the

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,340
most recent involvement of having

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,620
designers co-leading releases we've

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,040
started to get representation on them a

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,040
bit more

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,800
and even more so now with focus

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,570
designing through Gutenberg those in the

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,240
project are starting to see a place they

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,620
can aim for if they want and again it's

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,690
important to note that we shouldn't

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,030
create a system that forces everyone to

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,750
get anywhere by becoming a design lead

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,970
you can actually contribute in any way

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:27,100
many though do want to progress and even

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,820
just seen someone design leading and

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,170
actually being a designer doing that is

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,080
recognition enough that means they will

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:39,100
come to the project and they will stay

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,810
giving that opportunity is key designers

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,150
in fact any role actually need to be

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,890
unbonded into this project why mine

00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,470
hurts a little bit thinking about if I

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,600
came to WordPress today how much I would

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,340
have to understand and all the context

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,130
and the nuances I would have to get my

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,650
brain around to really function in this

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,500
project it's a lot you can't just land

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,850
someone into this vast universe of an

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,270
open-source project

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,920
and expect them to survive this is

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,750
something we're trying to fix as a

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,400
design team and actually across the

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,790
whole project there's movement to try

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,590
and change this it's important those who

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,870
know that onboarding also has to adapt

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,630
across different countries if you only

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,830
have your onboarding targeted at a 10

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,450
same type of person

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,850
remember you're going to attract that

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,090
type of person we want to be able to

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,630
have that openness and different voices

00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,580
ins in our project aborting also should

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,830
adapt and be iterated it shouldn't be

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,660
frozen on what is not a checkbox we go I

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,790
don't on boarding I'm done now then I

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,710
have to look at onboarding again as

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,850
designers we think of this user journey

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,430
we should be thinking of the

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,500
contribution journey and contribution

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,450
needs to be seen as a product with that

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,820
really the community you can start

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,010
thinking about the ways to fix and

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,090
create the best contribution product

00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:01,030
that we can and mentoring also is

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,370
something that is I firmly believe

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,880
is crucial for any type of contributor

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,320
often this is done casually one-on-ones

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,320
but I think it should be done in more

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,000
organized programs within the community

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,860
and I think it's done in certain teams

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,770
but we should be doing it across the

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,540
whole project this goes beyond just

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,730
onboarding and can answer all of the

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,180
time zones and diversity because it's

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:27,640
more kind of one-on-one and more

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,800
supportive in that way mentoring is

00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,710
something I personally really do want to

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,170
see more of here and it's also an

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,090
amazing thing if you haven't mentored do

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,950
you know it's a two-way experience so

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,240
anytime that I've been lucky enough to

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:46,590
be involved with mentor and so on I've

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:49,210
also learned a lot myself so this one is

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,460
interesting so kind of say because we do

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,580
have a design team but I think that's

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,040
the starting point not an end and in

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,710
many respects are often because we have

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,080
a design team it becomes isolated from

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,600
the other roles and design needs to be

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,550
truly in all areas and the activation

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,220
across the whole project used to happen

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,320
by having designers involved you can

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,880
activate an area that has no exposure to

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,200
the designers that just doesn't really

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,760
work and it's not a bad thing having a

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,280
design team at all it's amazing that we

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,500
have that but it's bad if it becomes a

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,020
walled space where designers huddle

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,240
together and don't explore from and that

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,980
is generally a sign that you haven't got

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,140
a healthy space if designers are just

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,760
huddling in one corner together it's not

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,420
necessarily saying they feel safe to go

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,610
anywhere creating safe paths and bridges

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,380
and empowering designers to really go

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,110
off and choose their own adventure

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:48,130
across the entire project that is where

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:50,080
success comes for us so in this last

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,480
kind of part of my talk I want to really

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,930
talk about the future and how we go

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,860
forward I think will show as a project

00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:01,600
where the design truly is at our heart

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,540
it also shows the project is left to be

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,559
dominated purely by developers and while

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,639
some might be okay with that

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,549
actually think that would be a good

00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,799
thing at all there are designers

00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:14,509
starting to thrive in the project and

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,090
more designers are starting to see it as

00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:20,360
a potential rate of contribute the time

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,549
is right to build on this tours are

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,440
really really important our tools we use

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:26,690
in github are better but they don't

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,559
actually recognize designers and they

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:33,019
don't really work and whilst we can wave

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,149
a magic wand and make or everything kind

00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,799
of better today and our tooling but we

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:40,399
had to invest not just in WordPress as a

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,429
project but in our tools in seeing how

00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:45,619
designers and developers actually any

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,379
role can be enabled to do the awesome

00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:50,990
work they need as a project we need

00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:54,289
better recognition from non cold

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,850
contributions and at the moment it's

00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,899
just too fragmented it's really

00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,789
difficult you have to get all these

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,879
Cylons you have to kind of duel these

00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:03,379
connections to be able to function so

00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:05,749
this is some great lab and it's it's a

00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:07,490
start but it's a very exciting to start

00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:10,429
for me because it means that not just

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,129
coders recognized and that's really

00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,019
important if we're counting

00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:17,929
contributions by lines of code what does

00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:20,210
that say about us as a project our tools

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:22,639
they should be inclusive and github

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:25,249
actually has some really bad not

00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,679
inclusive features like negative emoji

00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:30,470
reactions for example this can be used

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,850
to suppress voices and they can actually

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,129
be an instrument for bullying in a

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,869
project if you can to a project you're

00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:38,179
new and you're commenting on design and

00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:41,179
someone does that on your comment what

00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:42,679
is that as an experience for you you

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,179
might not agree with that but not

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,340
actually commenting to them and just

00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:49,460
giving them a thumbs down emoji it's not

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,440
a great way as a project progress we

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,840
will need to focus on creating workflows

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,379
that nurture and allow any role to

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,610
thrive and one of the things I'm sure

00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:00,710
we're gonna need sooner or later that's

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,720
a term that comes up time and time again

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,789
it's come up in community segments

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,340
conversations it's come up in work out

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,919
talks it's come up and it's it's really

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,330
happening with things like

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,090
we can't go on as the project without a

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,789
single source of truth we need to audit

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,950
what we have in code and design and then

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:22,220
look at solving the problem of whatever

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:24,109
a design system means for us and I say

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:27,190
that because as a project we need to

00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:29,479
determine what it means and adapt

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,249
patterns really are the key here and

00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:33,799
Gilbert has unlocked some of that with

00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:35,239
the components we need to turn that key

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,509
and walk through the door together as a

00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:40,460
project because along with that then

00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,799
send in some guidelines and we'll

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,539
consistent expected experience because

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,320
WordPress is good for the entire project

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:50,330
a system allows the scarce resources of

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,859
designers to be treated a respect and

00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,799
they don't have to invent everything

00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:58,789
everyone gains an iteration can happen

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,340
on the components themselves so design

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,729
truly I feel doesn't matter in open

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,979
source

00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:07,249
matters now and it matters in the future

00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:09,379
it can't be ignored or thought of in the

00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:11,809
same as development and assume that it's

00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:14,749
ok we need to create a space for

00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:16,309
designers to thrive and this isn't going

00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:18,070
to be a project just for developers

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,840
that's all kind of hopefully agree that

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,119
next time you refer to WordPress in a

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,789
comment try not say WordPress developers

00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,340
I see that pretty much every hour or

00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,679
every day within this project on posts

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,690
and comments there's not only developers

00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,710
involved in this project there's no any

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,999
developers involved working on core

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,909
designers and other worlds need a

00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:42,409
recognition and nurturing and then we

00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,210
get to keep them more within this

00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:47,239
project and that's a great thing for the

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,129
project we need all different types of

00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:50,570
designers as well and not force

00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:52,820
designers to be everything--all our

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,070
designers to specialize allow designers

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,289
to be in from different countries

00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:59,960
welcome any designers because we get

00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:02,720
strong as a project by doing that and if

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,239
we do this we truly contrive together

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,129
and achieve that goal of democratizing

00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:08,479
publishing otherwise we're just

00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:10,370
developing publishing

00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:20,870
I'm putting colors and I

00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:23,320
on it so thank you I think I have time

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,320
for questions

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,130
yeah I have some time for questions if I

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,570
know any questions and I'm gonna open it

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,160
if you want to ask questions about

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,160
Gutenberg and we're also happy to

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,870
so genuinely I don't think there is a

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:56,180
resistance if you speak openly about it

00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,270
I think it's not knowing it's the

00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,340
biggest resistance does that make sense

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:04,840
and I'd seen that within Guttenberg

00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:07,280
having designers working with developers

00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,050
there's not been a resistance it's just

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,180
worked and some incredible works happen

00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,930
because of that and and it's that kind

00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,380
of exposure

00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,340
that's why activation I think is really

00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,500
part of it that way

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,020
I think it's it's not a different change

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,500
in mind if you just have a communication

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:26,630
and talking I think it's quite difficult

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,780
if you are a developer that has only

00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,430
worked in developer teams and not even

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,530
in companies sometimes I at least I'll

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,420
own different roles in companies and

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,120
that's not great and I think on a

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,160
company level and agencies and all kind

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,630
of infrastructure a lot of people

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,820
starting to realize that's not the best

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,590
model anyway these diverse teams of

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,460
Wow's actually produce better work I

00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:51,470
mean feels like a really ABC thing when

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,270
you start like thinking about it but we

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,710
didn't used to do that and those little

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,170
there's almost like different floors

00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,420
wasn't it develop a floor and then there

00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,790
is this but by using words like engineer

00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,880
I think we start opening up the term

00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,660
develop a little bit more because

00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,630
there's all those kind of conversations

00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,660
happening as well so I think it's just

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,580
having a conversation

00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:18,230
resistance is is purely that right like

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,550
they're just just talking any other

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,120
question

00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:28,420
everyone on the scene is coffee we are

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,610
an experienced and so I love taking

00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,320
those ideas are you seeing new people

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,730
grows into the group or is this soul

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,530
within an existing with each other yeah

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,840
a couple years ago the design team was

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,760
just just one or two of us talking to

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,460
each other in the design channel which

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,470
was adorable but not really a way to

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,690
have a design team conversation but the

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,700
design team for WordPress has kind of

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,310
gone like this have come other people

00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,720
then it's had more people and we're

00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,810
definitely going it up now but the

00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,930
amount of people we have amazing

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,850
collection of team reps we have weekly

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,050
meetings we even at one point stopped

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,400
having weekly meetings because there

00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:10,120
just wasn't enough people to have weekly

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,590
meetings that's not a very good sign so

00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,440
let's say by doing this and we haven't

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,720
done all of this at all because I say we

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,060
because it's not I'm talking about my

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,280
ideas specifically here and my ideas

00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,080
alone on what should be implemented it's

00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,450
what they're collected with people who

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,920
are focusing and the team reps that's

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:30,190
what should be implemented this is a

00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,170
very personal talk some of the ideas I

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,130
would love to be added but I'm sure that

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,680
there are other people who have

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,630
different ideas and that's about being

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,030
open to this there could be someone that

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,670
turns up next this week in the design

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:46,000
team chat that has the secret to

00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:47,500
Gutenberg phase 20 right that is the

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,670
future leave there could be someone here

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,150
that comes to the contribution day

00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:53,620
tomorrow that it's a future design lead

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:56,920
there's all of that potential and being

00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,630
open to that is the biggest thing I

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,900
think that we can do and by being open

00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,640
to that we are having more designers

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,790
we're having designer contribution days

00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:10,210
that didn't kind of there's a band that

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,860
did happen more as well it's it's not an

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,770
instant fix because it needs to be a

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,130
conversation had by everybody involved

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:20,560
in the project and it's it's a difficult

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:23,610
balance but it's starting to I'd say

00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:27,100
it's time to happen which is so exciting

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,139
it's kind of what I want added of

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,360
WordPress and a one out of any projects

00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:33,549
they work with is to just have that

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,529
space that people can provide to do what

00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:37,809
they want so seeing someone come and

00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:40,330
then thrive and being able to do the

00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:55,059
work that that's like the biggest happy

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:57,039
to me so if you're around and to come to

00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:59,110
the contribution day tomorrow the main

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,240
reason is it's just a great way to just

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,850
in one day love it up really into it

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,500
like immersive experience if you can't

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,520
do that then go to make wordpress.org

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,139
you're trying to remember your else's

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,560
health I've only had one cup of tea so

00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:17,619
that was very difficult for me and just

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,349
me the descriptions of the teams the

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:21,790
reason that I say that is you can start

00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:24,790
to learn where you think you'd want to

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,740
contribute and start then following

00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,050
through the links there to be the blogs

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:32,200
of the teams each team has a specific

00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:35,560
blog and just start discovering you can

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,139
join chapter work faster or you can also

00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,540
the UK community has a slack which if

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:43,089
you don't feel quite ready to go fully

00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,649
into the bigger wider open source

00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,560
project just coming and joining that

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,839
community it's quite good to you if you

00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,700
are local to the area there's I don't

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,629
know do you know when the Manchester

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,129
meetup is there yeah so the third

00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,349
Wednesday of every month there's

00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:02,470
actually a meet-up here so meetup it's

00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:06,849
like a little little little word camp in

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:09,640
an evening kind of and you'll be able to

00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:10,750
hear some talks I think yeah and they

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,150
had this before Matt so I was just

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,190
checking over the returns here and just

00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,079
be able to come

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,069
and have like a made-up conversation I

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,140
didn't if you've done like

00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:20,760
designer/developer or any other type of

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,490
meetups but they're really really great

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,500
for you to just come over near me and

00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,299
just network as well so there's a lot of

00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,900
different ways that you can start join

00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:33,630
me but just kind of choosing your path I

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,910
would say start by listening it's gonna

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:39,079
be a lot when you first come into any

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:41,309
project just start kind of finding a way

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,760
talk I'm going to be here the whole day

00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:48,089
I'm happy to talk so just come and say

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,589
hi and I'm happy to find you know kind

00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:53,609
of how you can kind of get involved as

00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:55,470
well how do you explain to people that

00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:58,740
when you're saying designer you don't

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:01,410
mean the person who does the trick yeah

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,559
we're actually handling user experience

00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,500
yeah yeah I think that's not a

00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,940
conversation you can say in a sentence

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,799
interesting way I'd only speak from my

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,030
own personal experience because I'm not

00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:14,609
someone you want to make things pretty

00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,920
Ness and say I mean I can but my my

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:19,140
background is purely in is fermion

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,250
experience and that I think is a good

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,010
starting point

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,500
I do use sometimes the the real-world

00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,140
examples of the things that you use the

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,529
products are designed the buildings that

00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,869
you live in the towns that you function

00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:37,200
in that tends to get people stopping

00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:39,000
thinking about the putting pixel little

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,950
icons and start thinking about that

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,440
everything they experience has been

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,289
designed by someone and that's kind of

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,109
like once you open that door for people

00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:51,390
thinking about experience then design

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:53,250
opens up as a concept in a little bit

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,670
but I think it's similar for developers

00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,349
as well there's like a narrow like

00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,270
concept of what a developer is and that

00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,609
isn't true either so it's it's a

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,329
discussion we need to have and I think

00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:09,180
that that's part of like this role use

00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:10,859
is we need to see it like as a designer

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,230
you need to bear to see someone that is

00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:15,089
using the word design and you need to

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,730
see that there's a team for it but you

00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:20,730
need to see the breadth of it and it's

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,470
very very interesting how over time the

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,940
phrase of what the design team has

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,190
evolved just a couple of sentences

00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,530
on the make site of what the design team

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,200
is because we need to be saying

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,570
everything that we do and saying that in

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:53,200
one or two sentence this is a really

00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:55,420
interesting challenge but I think but

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,090
then the problem of design engineer is

00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,640
that means that some designers will say

00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:02,530
oh I need to be technical so we have to

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,690
be sensitive that way not every designer

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,630
is going to code and not every designer

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:10,180
should have to code so I think it's it's

00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:13,150
the great term but it's a term that

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,500
doesn't necessarily help everybody and

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,240
that that's part of the conversation

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,120
which is why we probably don't need to

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,160
talking roles we just need to talk about

00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,740
experience is a great unlocker and just

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,740
start talking about the people that are

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,740
going to be experiencing the product the

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,390
customers the people we call users for

00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,790
people we could whatever we call them

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,260
who are going to be daily interacting

00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,240
with work ice we shift the conversation

00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,910
on to the experience and we shift the

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,460
conversation on to what their journeys

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,920
are like then we stop getting hung up on

00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,710
titles titles that something you put as

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,120
a hat on a human and we need to start

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,180
thinking about what the experience is

00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,180
like

00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:58,079
Oh designers are very hung up on time

00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,579
everybody is telling upon tiles right in

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,829
the outside corporate world quite often

00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:04,109
the title means a pay right

00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:06,240
it means a pay in command it means a

00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:10,020
recognition it means well I've now got

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,109
to this point so I'm senior vice hamster

00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,119
Wrangler whatever like like like you see

00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:19,230
some people with like 20 different

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,819
things in their title of gerbils or

00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,800
something like it's ridiculous what they

00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:24,630
have as their tie doesn't I'm saying

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,050
gerbils and hamsters but like you it's

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:30,270
this amazing thing that we say but

00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,859
that's taking us further and further

00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:34,290
away from the people using our product

00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:36,060
the more things we add to our title the

00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:40,079
more things we're focusing on us not the

00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,400
experience thank you great thanks very

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:48,010
much coming

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,010
