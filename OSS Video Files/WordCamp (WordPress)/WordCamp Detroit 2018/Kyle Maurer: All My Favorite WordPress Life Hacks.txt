00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,119
we're gonna speed through this a pretty

00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:18,830
high pace and I hope everybody can hear

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,600
me I try my best to project it's

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,789
something I'm working on there's anybody

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,480
who is struggling a little bit at this

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,730
kind of volume this is kind of my volume

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,800
we awkward to go louder or quieter but

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,950
let's get started I want to emphasize

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,290
first and foremost that this is the

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,480
condensed version of my wordpress lights

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,340
packs I have a longer version of this I

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,560
really had that cut it down trim the fat

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,960
this is just the good stuff and this is

00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,520
a April 20 18 edition if you asked me a

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,530
year ago it would be a different list of

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,700
things if you ask me next year it'll be

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,200
different again but these are the things

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,260
that are helping me make my bed life

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,660
better right now and what's also making

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,700
my life better is that hey we're getting

00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,870
through this extra long winter that we

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,500
had anybody get this joke it's gonna be

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,450
Mike I love it I resist we made it

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,159
through a hard winter but now it's

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:16,670
WordCamp season everybody let's let's

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,149
talk about how you are sitting here you

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,490
are thinking you probably want to be

00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:25,999
like that guy who's up there I'm like

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,049
you Mona be as productive as Kyle can do

00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:31,219
all these great things I want to be as

00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:33,170
cool as the guy who won Best Actor for

00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,499
his portrayal of Gandalf at the 2010

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,939
Mauer Movie Awards yeah you want to be

00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:39,409
as cool as this guy or it's productive

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,719
as this guy these are the life facts

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,270
needed to follow so without further ado

00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:47,179
let's just start hitting them in no

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,399
particular order let's start with diff

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,170
Jecker calm this is a handy tool

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,659
super simple website that I use all the

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,240
time it is used just for pasting two

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,740
different pieces of text and comparing

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,030
the differences between them

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,759
probably some people in here who have

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:05,389
used this I use this just to see what's

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,009
different about two pieces of text or

00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:08,630
snippets of code sometimes maybe

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,800
somebody's proofreading something for me

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,000
and they said I've made some changes

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,830
here it is and I want to know what

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,230
changes did you make or I've even had

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,209
cases where sites were compromised and

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,010
files were modified according to the

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,520
logs and I wanted to see what

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,650
modifications

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,450
were made to files what code was changed

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,800
in something someone sent me is diff

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,870
checker all the time just to see what

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,270
was changed git is something that is an

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,560
essential for every developer if you're

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,840
a developer you have to be using git

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,370
this is a rule this is critical there's

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
no excuse for not using it learn it's

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,800
not that hard get us for version

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,140
controlling your code it's not just

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,450
strictly code but that's where it's most

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,220
commonly employed and it is just it's

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,720
just essential it will make your life

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,930
better it will make you a better person

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,150
if you use yeah this is that important I

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,890
can't emphasize the importance of using

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,970
it enough it changed my life when I

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:04,340
started using it phpstorm is a great

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,060
application I love it how many people

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,880
use PHP farm in here a few a few it's so

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,060
powerful it has made me a better

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,220
developer writing code in phpstorm is

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,200
just a great experience it's an

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,970
extremely powerful program with a lot of

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,240
features built in including a built in

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,240
terminal and it integrates with git so

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,340
you can pull down your repository

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,990
straight from phpstorm you can do a lot

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,730
that you would otherwise have to do in

00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,780
several applications you can do it all

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,940
in phpstorm

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,490
but it's great for just conceptualizing

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,320
all of your files as a project and

00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,110
indexing everything together so when you

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,450
see a function or a variable PCP sorem

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,010
is great about like hinting what you

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,330
should be doing and maybe indicating

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,980
when you're doing something wrong like

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,530
maybe you're you're returning this

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,420
function as a boolean but it's expecting

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,300
a string maybe you should check that out

00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,650
catches a lot of errors before I deploy

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,060
them and that's really helpful I'm not

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,830
gonna be the kind of person who's going

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,390
to tell you anything crazy like you can

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,370
live without social media just cut it

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,160
from your life social media is

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,650
entrenched in all of our lives it's

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,310
something that is just here to stay and

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,770
we just need to be responsible and learn

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,240
how to incorporate it responsibly into

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:25,450
our lives and for me the trick has been

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,580
taking deliberate steps to make it

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,770
inconvenient to use social media and

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,139
good examples of this are removing the

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,819
apps from any device that I have

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,770
so I have to use the browser it's still

00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,900
possible for me to use social media

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,969
because well as I said it's a part of

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,569
our life the social media is here to

00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:45,740
stay we can't really escape it but we

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,659
can do a lot to make it a little more

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,490
inconvenient to use so it doesn't become

00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:55,249
that dangerous time-suck that it often

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:57,590
is if you are building WordPress

00:04:55,249 --> 00:05:00,949
websites local development is the way to

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,900
go local development is essential that

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,819
is a responsible way to build websites

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,460
this is where you use a free like

00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,009
desktop server or local by flywheel to

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,020
install a wordpress site that exists

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,669
only on your machine not on the web it's

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,550
accessible only by you you can just

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,779
create these there at a domain in your

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,610
browser that is only accessible on your

00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,319
computer this is your perfect sandbox

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,089
for experimenting you can exce tall

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,949
plugins you can to configure them the

00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,050
way you want you can build out a website

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,550
you can hack the code do whatever you

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,499
want and then nuke this site when you're

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,270
done just for fun this is the

00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,189
responsible thing to do just spin up a

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,289
site on your computer it'll be faster

00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,589
than anything on the Internet experiment

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,699
before you ever take anything online

00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,229
that's the way to go try these free

00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,819
programs and incorporate that into your

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:52,639
workflow just a life hack here one of

00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:54,649
the when we're developing our careers

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,110
there's so many different things that we

00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:59,060
can invest in an investment just being

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,909
you know something that we can put our

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,479
time and energy into now that will pay

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:08,930
off later and one of the one of the best

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:12,349
things that I've found that is fruitful

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,389
to invest in early is reputation this

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,830
has been this has been really helpful in

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,909
opening doors that I didn't even know I

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,409
wanted to walk through you can invest in

00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:22,879
education you can invest in

00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,500
relationships you can invest in

00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,270
acquiring assets and so many other

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,909
things but investing in one's reputation

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,469
is just take my word for it extremely

00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:32,870
powerful it'll take you places you

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:35,870
didn't even know you wanted to go I've

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,759
been able to take advantage of

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,469
opportunities just because I spend a lot

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,729
of time investing in my reputation and

00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:42,259
one of the ways that we can do this

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,240
we'll start there how you can invest in

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,580
your reputation is a little bit of a

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,699
mindset shift it's thinking about

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,409
others first is the simplest step when

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,610
you're at an event like this you

00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,629
approach conversations with other people

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,030
you look at all these other wonderful

00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,490
people who are with you and instead of

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,740
thinking like maybe this curved person

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,409
could be my next customer or this person

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,699
could help me solve my problems turn

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:07,759
that on its head think in a different

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,349
context think about how maybe I could

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,939
help that person maybe I could solve

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,400
their problems that I've already figured

00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,169
out maybe I could help them work through

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,530
a struggle that they're having and think

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,319
about it in this sense is the first step

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,710
to in graining yourself at community and

00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,030
building a reputation and then you can

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,129
take that a step further you can

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,780
volunteer you can engage the community

00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,389
even more and the next thing you know

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,280
you're important someone you're someone

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:38,029
that people know and speak highly of and

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,129
this is in dividends for me in recent

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:43,069
years ways that I never really expected

00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:46,969
coming I was able to get a job that I

00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:49,340
wanted just by asking for it there was

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,440
no opening I just said I want to work at

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,449
this company and because I wasn't a

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,560
stranger and had a reputation they said

00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:59,690
great let's go I can speak when I want

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,699
to a great of it's like this because I'm

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,639
not a stranger and I've even had clients

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,229
in the past who said don't worry Kyle

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,940
we're not looking at other people we

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:10,129
feel like we're lucky to get to work

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,930
with you because we see the other people

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,270
who are going to you for advice and

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,159
looking up to you reputation pays out

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:20,509
big time in the future and it's

00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,770
worthwhile investing in early on typing

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,199
out passwords is stupid

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,909
get the knocks lock app on your iPhone

00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,349
and just tap your iPhone every time you

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:31,250
have to log into your Mac it's super

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,930
handy it saves you time I want you guys

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,329
put your hands up in the air we're all

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,419
going to stay this together all right

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:42,500
we're all going to commit to this I do

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:48,290
solemnly swear that the next website I

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:52,710
build will not have a homepage carousel

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:55,650
okay we all in agreement on VIP we are

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,650
all gonna work together to let this dumb

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,420
trend stay in the past and die and

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,630
become this thing that we laugh about

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,280
like remember back in 2011 to 2015 when

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,040
it was cool to have the sliders and they

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,980
say hahaha I'm so glad those days are

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,410
gone I'm tired of even the discussion

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,380
about sliders they're a trend there in

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,080
the past goodbye we all have agreed I

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:25,520
heard you we're on the same page here

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:28,400
goodbye sliders and we won't miss you

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,780
there's a lot of times where I want to

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,280
show some kind of a prototype I want to

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,740
show what something might look like

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,420
that's in my head and it would be

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,930
incredibly tedious for me to use like a

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,600
graphical design program to slice and

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,670
dice up images I just a lot for when I'm

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,800
building presentations and and showing

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,470
people what an interface might look like

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,320
in the WordPress admin or what a web

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,740
page could look like and it would be

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,410
super painful to try and piss in

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,150
Photoshop or whatnot did you know you

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,940
can just like right click and your

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,040
browser inspect and just modify the web

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,339
page you're viewing with a few simple

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,900
clicks it's very simple in whatever

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,060
browser you're using there's a tool like

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,240
this chrome is fantastic you can just

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,550
right-click on an element and this this

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,920
pale on the right will appear and you

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,300
can just click on HTML and delete it if

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,360
you don't want it there and it'll

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,089
disappear from the page you can modify

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,280
the text as I did in the example which

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm doing all the time sometimes I'll be

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,730
taking a screen grab of like a user's

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,020
list in the WordPress dashboard and I

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,870
want to use this in like our product

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,780
documentation or whatever but all those

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,000
are real users emails so instead of like

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,250
editing those users or making fake users

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,260
I just modify the page and just type out

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,540
a fake email so that the screenshot

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,280
looks legitimate but it's an honest fake

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,860
email address it's just a simple example

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,870
but prototyping in the browser with dev

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,060
tools than just taking a screen capture

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,970
of it is my life hack getting things

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,760
done much quicker

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,520
I like to be the kind of person that

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,830
reaches out to people randomly and a fun

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,330
hack that I've found is just following

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,250
up with people the kind of people that

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,290
you meet at events like this and just

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,660
touching base with them with no agenda

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,650
I like the conversation so much better

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,630
this is something that I found

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,270
consistently the conversations are

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,970
really great if you open them up without

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:25,190
an agenda they always go much better

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,800
Noah no no points to this conversation

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,260
no objective just reaching out to say

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,910
hey how are you what's new in your life

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,740
what are you struggling with these days

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,000
what are you stoked about what's your

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,770
future looking like what are you hoping

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,120
for this kind of conversations is

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,650
touching base with people randomly

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,300
whoever you've met at this kind of an

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:45,050
event in the future you'll be surprised

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,300
where those things go I can't live

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,790
without my sit-stand desk if for some

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,380
reason it disappeared I would have to

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,630
take the day off and immediately get one

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,280
because it's that important to me I have

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,750
a nice little one with a motor on a

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,610
little button that can go up and down I

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,740
do it several times a day we're just

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,040
more productive standing that's just a

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,570
fact and I love this thing I really

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,550
seriously love it and I recommend it to

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,380
everybody I also love my portrait

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,810
oriented monitor I don't know about you

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,260
guys but a big part of my job is viewing

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:17,930
things called webpages and a lot of

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,820
those are actually oriented vertically

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,680
and not wide I don't know what the thing

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,900
is but the big widescreen monitors but I

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,620
find that I have a lot of wasted space

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,290
on the horizontal monitors and oriented

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,390
orienting my monitor portrait style just

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:39,650
means that much more to see and one go

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:43,130
and I love it I love it easy win another

00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,870
tip that has proven successful I got

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,390
years and years ago I acted on it and

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,330
it's been very very constructive has

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,580
been actively interviewing peers in the

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,770
industry to benefits that come from this

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,060
one is just like taking their knowledge

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,570
people who know more than you've been

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,400
there done that learning from them but

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,080
also building great relationships with

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,740
the people who really matter in the

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,770
industry

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,020
did we an interest with that are where

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,460
you're trying to go those relationships

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,400
are very very valuable

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,020
they can also be

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,690
beneficial from a business standpoint

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,770
because if you're collaborating in any

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,870
sense with peers in the industry you can

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,880
often leverage their audiences if you're

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,760
interviewing them on your blog via text

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,610
quoting them and so forth that can be

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,990
very useful for your content marketing

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,120
interviewing them in our video series or

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,190
on your podcast all of these things are

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,380
pretty low barrier easy to do for your

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,570
business and like just one of the

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,490
quickest shortcuts to a new audience is

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,990
to bring peers people with a big

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,660
audience into yours

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,970
and most everyone is pretty receptive to

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,390
that it's not hard to do the benefit is

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:55,600
pretty high so it's this shortcut

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,339
and speaking of shortcuts keyboard

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,930
shortcuts are the way to go I mean who

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,060
uses a mouse anymore

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,800
anybody who's pointing and clicking can

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,660
never keep up with the person who knows

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,150
the keyboard shortcuts so save yourself

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,310
some time invest just a little bit of

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,080
time and energy into mastering all the

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,089
keyboard shortcuts on your computer and

00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,010
you'll be a whiz will never be as

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,480
accurate with the mouse how many times

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,150
have you click on something you didn't

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,190
mean to one of those stupid ads or close

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,020
the window that you meant to minimize or

00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,490
something just use keyboard shortcuts

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:29,589
it's so much better I'm a huge proponent

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,339
of podcasts I love them for so many

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,190
reasons

00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,290
there's a lot lot of great audio content

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,020
out there that we can enjoy and learn

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,000
from but one of the coolest things about

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,250
them you can learn and taking

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,930
information a variety of formats you can

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,660
attend as live lectures like this you

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,160
can watch video you can read stuff

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,860
that's all really cool but podcasts are

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,680
superior in one way and that's that they

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,470
can be consumed actively we can listen

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,390
to podcasts while doing other stuff or

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,060
you're washing the dishes and doing your

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,709
chores and drivin and whatever you can

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,830
be taking in information and learning

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:09,370
that's phenomenal every other channel

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:13,930
every other medium for information you

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,089
need to be focused on it and that kind

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,980
of sucks in comparison so I listen to

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,320
podcasts like all the time every time I

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,270
turn away from the screen and goes their

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
phones that I'm learning while I'm

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,440
sweeping and so forth

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,870
I like to be the kind of person I try

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,529
hard to be the kind of person who gives

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,620
more regular gestures of appreciation

00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:38,209
how many times a day are we taking

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,300
advantage of something that some other

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:44,180
creative person created and just not

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,060
acknowledging at all using a plug-in an

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,190
app reading an article whatever it is

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,279
just taking advantage of the work that

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,959
someone else did and then just moving on

00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,630
with our life I like promoting a culture

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,569
where people give shout outs more often

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,009
and show gestures of appreciation we got

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:05,899
a lot of free stuff that we're so just

00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,490
like desensitized to it we don't even

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,470
know how could we have it we didn't

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,670
appreciate how much free stuff we're

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,339
getting all the time but I really want

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:19,220
to be more like the person who takes the

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:21,889
time to leave a rate review for the

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,019
podcaster the plug-in that I use or just

00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,970
share in a public tweet to say you know

00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:28,190
what I just used this app or just read

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,589
this great article on WP tavern or

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,899
something that was good and thank you

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,000
guys for writing it because I know more

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,579
based on the free thing that you made

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,540
free or not people creating great things

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,480
that make our lives better

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,930
maybe deserve some love that's just

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,089
being a good person online and when it

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,310
comes to email it was a part of all our

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,699
lives we have powerful email

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,130
applications I use Mac mail and it's got

00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:56,720
all kinds of powerful rules belty and i

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,010
try to take advantage of these I'm one

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,709
of those weird people who maintains

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,230
inbox zero at all times and how I do

00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:05,510
that is largely by fiercely guarding my

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,400
inbox protecting it against anything

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,980
that doesn't require my attention and

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,589
immediate action so I have simple rules

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,140
like this one in place where in this

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,409
case an email any email that comes into

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,380
my inbox that even contains the text

00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:23,959
unsubscribe in its body gets dumped into

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,490
a low priority folder which I later sift

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,439
through and probably click on all of

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,780
those unsubscribe links because I don't

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
need any of that stuff in my life it's

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,790
pretty low priority you have a lot of

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,730
other similar rules helps to that help

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,600
to filter out

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,280
anything that is it really important get

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,930
it out of my inbox shuffle it into low

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,770
priority folders which I will check on a

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,480
routine basis clean through so this is

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,570
really important and in a similar vein

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,820
turning off email notifications is super

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,770
important like we don't need this junk

00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,200
you don't want this crap every stupid

00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,080
app out there that we use whether it's

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,420
WordPress or Facebook or social media or

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,240
github or whatever this is they all want

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,340
to email you whenever some dumb thing

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,050
happens on their platform but you know

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,610
what if I want to know what's going on

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,830
on your platform go to your stupid

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,810
platform I don't want it in my inbox

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,860
this is an important rule we can turn

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:25,420
off this crap if you want to grow as a

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:28,480
developer a smart thing to do is to open

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,540
up your code with your friends with

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,830
other people and show it now this is

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,230
hard some of you if you're not

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,270
developers in this room I'll explain why

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,700
and the developers will I think this

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,210
will resonate with you we learned this

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,920
on our own we were self-taught we were

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,220
not classically trained whatever that

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,740
even means of the developer and we

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,150
hacked our way to figuring stuff out you

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,770
have problems to solve somehow we

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,650
figured a little bit of code out next

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,780
thing you know we're a developer and now

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,700
we're in this third place where we're a

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,810
little bit self-conscious about what we

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:08,200
create with code because we we know this

00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:11,410
is probably not the right way it's just

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,790
a hack I think but I don't really know

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,740
the right way I just know this this

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,200
works and so I'm a little self-conscious

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,210
about it I don't really want anybody to

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,790
look at it I feel like I'm just standing

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:25,360
here in my underwear when it looks at my

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,490
code like oh please no go easy I mean

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,920
you know I just got it from Stack

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:34,630
Overflow come on go easy but this is how

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,160
this developers feel is there any

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:40,030
developer here who kind of like written

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,850
like relates okay a few kind of relate

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,620
all right that's how we feel but we need

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,970
to get over this and it's not just

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,370
developers it's anybody building

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,480
websites or doing something creative on

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,280
your own especially those of us who are

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,190
right independently not as a part of a

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,890
team we need to learn to swallow our

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,230
pride and events like this are a great

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,690
opportunity to open up our machines and

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,880
log into our dashboard and say hey and

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,410
I'm just like taking a look this is how

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,690
I decided to solve my problem

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,930
I decided to use this page builder or

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,290
this theme or write my code this way

00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:17,510
what do you think about that do this

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,310
that is hard there's a lot of us who

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,650
squirm at the thought of doing that

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,990
because we feel like we have to figure

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,730
it out a random way to do this but we

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,750
need to swallow our pride we need to

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,520
share it with others that's how we grow

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,460
WP CLI is another great shortcut just

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,740
kind of like the how no one who points

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,930
in clicks their way will ever keep up

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,600
with somebody writing using keyboard

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,040
shortcuts WP CLI is a command-line

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,110
interface that's built into work that

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,370
WordPress where you can type out and

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,140
execute your commands against your

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,730
WordPress site so if you want to like

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,830
for example in this screenshot they

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,470
install a plugin by just typing WP

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,800
install plugin installed jetpack

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,560
activate and so in like less than two

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,420
seconds I have this being installed and

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,010
activated where if I was just you know

00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,960
point and clicking through the admin go

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,970
into plugins add new and search for and

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,340
install and activate that's ten fifteen

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,170
seconds I don't know this is and this is

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,340
just a very simple example of the kinds

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,330
of commands you can run against your

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,240
site by command line using WP CLI and

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,160
really speed things up for you user

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
switching is an awesome plugin that i

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,330
use on almost every site it's a

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,610
troubleshooting godsend it allows you to

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,070
experience the wordpress site as another

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,720
user with just a click switch to that

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,950
user and you're seeing it like they see

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,880
it awesome

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,650
it's free on the on the repo my wife and

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,630
i are in the process of like trying to

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,040
move buy a new house and we're going

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,590
through the attic and the basement

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,960
finding all this stuff that we have and

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,990
asking the question like what is this

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,520
even can we let it go we haven't used it

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,620
in years and that's the same way i feel

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,990
when i domain registrar and look at the

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,390
domains that like maybe i registered

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,490
after a few drinks at an after party at

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,620
a word camp a few

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,630
years ago and I still haven't done

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,550
anything of that dumb domain so this is

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,100
this is me saying like let's all try to

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,200
be stronger and just let those stupid

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,840
domains go when they come up for renewal

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,000
just make that be your goal if you

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,240
haven't used the domain in your first

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,370
year just let it go alright don't do not

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,370
renew that domain that you haven't used

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:30,450
yet it's weird to even describe this as

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:34,210
a problem but a lot of us I know have it

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,830
this is a fact actually developers who

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,429
write inline documentation should go

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:42,210
straight to heaven when they die that's

00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:45,340
what this gray text is at the top the

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:50,140
comment it just precedes a function and

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:52,870
it described and does and it's amazing

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,030
it's so helpful as another developer to

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,980
of which code that has helpful and

00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,380
descriptive and accurate inline

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,660
documentation it's a beautiful wonderful

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,480
thing and if you're a developer I

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,030
strongly encourage I beg you to write

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,500
inland documentation please every class

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,960
and function should have inline Doc's

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,000
just for the reading of other developers

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,160
many applications actually reference

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,530
this inline documentation phpstorm is a

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,990
good example the reasons it's so smart

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,480
about knowing how variables and classes

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,790
and methods and functions should operate

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,170
leads the inline docs and it says you

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,179
know you're actually trying to access a

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,280
protected method you're trying to return

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,510
something boolean that's an integer and

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,250
so on the inline Doc's inform that and

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,480
allow us to extend code more easily so

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,480
please write inline documentation

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,410
that'll save you and it'll make you a

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,300
better person if you're doing anything

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,110
with ecommerce abandoned carts are a

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:52,600
thing it will surprise you to learn how

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,270
what percentage of your users are

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,429
abandoning your cart and not completing

00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:01,179
purchase the good news is there are

00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:03,700
really powerful tools available to help

00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:06,460
you with this problem tools like jilt

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,160
which I recently install turned on in my

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,620
site and for one was thrilled with how

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,510
easy it was I procrastinate a little and

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,100
found out oh I guess this was a piece of

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,900
cake in less than two minutes I'm done

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,270
and now customer

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,920
to start the checkout process but don't

00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,620
finish it later on we had a couple of

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,570
follow-up emails to say hey did you do

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,280
forget something or maybe even get an

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,110
automatically generated discount code

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,050
like come back and finish your purchase

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,820
and so on so these are lost customers

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,410
that are coming back this is money that

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,230
I I'm getting that I would have lost

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,420
otherwise with a tool like Jill that

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,770
automates those email follow-ups there

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,150
are others but I just love Jill it

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,030
integrates with Google commerce and easy

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,370
digital downloads colorbox is another

00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:50,320
great plugin that I it's really simple

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,720
to implement for creating like those

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,940
little banners and faux chat things and

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,470
the pop ups on your site that prompt

00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,990
people to subscribe to your newsletter

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,580
or check out your latest sale this name

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,190
can be a little intrusive so using

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,140
moderation but they do work they really

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,660
do how every box is a great one that has

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,679
a free version that we've gotten a lot

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:14,110
of conversions from speaking of where

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,880
camps is I think a life hack that put me

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,230
on the fast track to learning a lot of

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,740
things and getting a lot of great

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,110
connections in this industry when you

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,120
speak in a word camp you get to rub

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,070
elbows with other speakers go to special

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,170
dinners and meet the people that you

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,679
admire and been learning from for four

00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,540
years

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,670
it also gives you an opportunity to give

00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,750
back to other people there's a lot of

00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,610
you who are learning things right now

00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,830
you now have enough knowledge to turn

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:42,550
around and help somebody else out and so

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:45,309
I say it's your turn coming up here soon

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,990
you can speak at local meetups we're can

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,320
still have the same exact problem but

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,570
meetups always are practically desperate

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,580
for speakers begging all the time

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,559
anybody want a step up big just just

00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:00,179
show us anything you're trying to do

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:04,420
even if it's terrible and let's just

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:05,860
anybody speak please so speak at a local

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,360
meetup and just share your knowledge

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,210
with other people that's always a

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,270
positive really does kind of put you on

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,990
the fast track helping other people

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,120
exposing you in the right way when I

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,309
went to my first work in bi I knew I

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,390
wanted to talk to a lot more people but

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,250
that's a little bit hard a little bit

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,770
intimidating when you feel like you're

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:26,530
not anybody and don't have anything much

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,330
to share but I did notice that like I've

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,080
got a few things I could share so I

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,090
could choose to be one of the people in

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,919
I'm standing to speak with a speaker

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,080
after they're done or I could be people

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,210
lining up to talk to me that sounded a

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,480
lot easier that definitely is easier

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,500
than randomly approaching strangers

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,320
volunteering at word camps is also

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,480
really helpful just a simple easy way to

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,080
integrate yourself in a community the

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,149
bar is low ya help people out it's all

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,740
volunteers here these events are put

00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:56,419
together entirely by volunteers just

00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,500
donating their time for fun

00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:01,460
keep that in mind when you leave a

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,960
review after this event please clearly

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,820
monitor is another plug-in that is

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,309
essential for troubleshooting this is

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,019
immensely powerful it will tell you

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,460
everything that you need more about

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:13,070
every page that's being loaded it's a

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:18,740
free plugin on wordpress.org I run it on

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:23,720
every site every site and my last chip

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:25,279
as we are departing for lunch you didn't

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,760
have to come out here to get this

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,880
knowledge I'm not sharing anything that

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,620
you can't find elsewhere from smarter

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,659
people you could go online you know like

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,440
we have things called online conferences

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:40,880
we have the technology we can do that

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,429
but there are really compelling reasons

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,980
why we get together IRL at events like

00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,169
this and that's because this is how we

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,299
can meet each other going through

00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,220
similar things you're sitting next to

00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,929
people who have solved problems that

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,610
you're trying to solve you're also

00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:57,889
sitting next to people who are trying to

00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,289
solve problems you already have solved

00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:02,090
and you are sitting next to other people

00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,010
who are looking to sell something you're

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,019
looking to buy and looking to partner

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,690
with somebody that's a perfect fit for

00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,980
you this is your opportunity to meet the

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,750
other people going through the same

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,740
things and who care about what you care

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:18,860
about so take advantage of this go sit

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,539
with some strangers don't don't be me

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,070
and just gravitate towards your friends

00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:27,860
I try hard to do this but try hard to

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,929
seek out strangers people that know and

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,510
sit with them at lunch this is the best

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:34,220
opportunity of the day and and meet more

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,740
people here because that's the one thing

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,740
that you can't get from all the valuable

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,620
online learning that we have let's do a

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,700
quick recap because Deborah has it

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,740
flagged down

here are the four tools that I really

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,910

plugins I can't believe that and none of

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,360
them are self-promotional at all I have

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,150

and do those things and I also think

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,990
it's really important to invest in your

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,520
reputation as I said get involved in

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,290
