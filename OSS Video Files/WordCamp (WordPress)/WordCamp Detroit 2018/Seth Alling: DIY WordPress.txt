Description: 
	The ease of WordPress has catered to quick learners and do-it-yourselfers. It’s what makes WordPress so great and universal. However, many questions come with the DYI approach: What should I look for when selecting a theme? How I find good plugins to extend my site’s functionality? When is it better to hire someone else to develop my website? How can I prequalify a developer? Knowing the answers to these question can save you from a few headaches.

your program is DIY WordPress and I have

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,880
a quick question who here is actually

00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:31,000
used WordPress before is anyone here who

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,699
hasn't used WordPress okay good

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,269
I was gonna all right get out I want to

00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,269
see you here Kyle

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:46,930
no cool my clicker doesn't work this

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:51,190
would be fun technical difficulties I

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,290
work in the web so long have you been

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,579
using WordPress show of hands who here

00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,270
has been using WordPress for at least

00:00:54,579 --> 00:01:05,199
one year at least one year all right at

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:11,380
least years five years since 2011 since

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,819
2009 since 2008 no one beat me

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,119
I was wherever someone else wanted give

00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,119
the talk

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:27,469
fine I'm fine so the years 2009 and at

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,479
the time I was a college student at BYU

00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,829
and while I was there I was working as a

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,590
graphic designer

00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:37,909
in the athletic department and we needed

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,200
to create a portfolio for engrave one of

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,569
the classes that I had I was an

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
advertising major and I had heard that

00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:46,520
WordPress was pretty easy someone go

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
okay we'll try it out and in less than

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,649
two weeks I had a website and to give

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,079
you a quick glimpse of what I looked

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,929
like in college yeah

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,920
some random nerd broken nose I actually

00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:04,299
had some hair and eventually I had to

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,739
move away from college I had four jobs

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:09,019
so I grew up in Michigan I'm from this

00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,319
area and it was on the short list of

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:15,920
potential locations where I could work

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,470
now somehow I managed to find a job as

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,730
web designer in Royal Oak and I really

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,970
don't know how that happened

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,799
because the years 2009 and if anyone

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,560
remembers what the economy was doing in

00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:30,200
the city at that time somehow I got a

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,410
job I don't know so even though I was

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,100
hired in as web designer I had basic

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,730
HTML and CSS knowledge and I could make

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,670
an HTML website I also knew how to tweak

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,959
a wordpress theme because of that

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,170
portfolio that I had to do I could

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,859
modify the plea so one day my boss comes

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,599
up to me and he says do you know how to

00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:57,260
create a wordpress theme from scratch

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:01,370
and realize at this time I do not know

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,799
PHP or anything about it and so I'm like

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,609
hmm if you're asked that question what

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,980
would you say I said yes and immediately

00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,940
I started googling how to build a

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,069
WordPress theme

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,980
now I got enough that I was able to

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,109
build up a site just kind of looking

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,310
through tutorials a lot of them and that

00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:22,669
is what started my career building

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:26,269
WordPress sites now I build custom

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,669
plugins full time I build custom themes

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,600
occasionally but the good thing is I

00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:31,970
started with

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,620
the do-it-yourself approach and that

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,950
should give you at least maybe a little

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,390
bit of hope because this guy here he's

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:45,020
got no clue what he's doing so let's get

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:48,050
started now I'm gonna assume that most

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,270
have a basic WordPress understanding

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,410
this is not a 101 course this is not a

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:58,070
pages verse posters told the one that

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:01,220
I'm replacing was this is not how to use

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,730
the editor or how to download a plugin

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,560
or a theme if you need that places to

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,360
learn WordPress there's a happiness bar

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,450
on the third floor below you can go down

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,950
talk to some nice people there just talk

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,740
to people here at WordCamp that's right

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,770
or you can go look at WordPress dot TV

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,720
or also there's local meetups that you

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,790
can attend we've got a couple of them in

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,140
the Detroit area there's one in Ann

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,730
Arbor as well or you can take some

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:33,290
classes so let's start with using themes

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,610
themes are pretty easy to get to you go

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,200
to appearance themes in the editor and

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:43,460
these are the default themes on a clean

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,580
WordPress installation nooks like so

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:50,510
they are great themes and how do we know

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,780
that because there is 1 million strong

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,340
of this theme on here so you know that

00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:01,100
you're gonna have a great website when

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:03,170
it looks like everyone else's website so

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,150
that means you probably need to select a

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,710
theme for yourself so what are some of

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,890
the things that you need to ask when

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,470
you're selecting a theme first thing is

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,990
find out what your budget is find out if

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,230
you're looking for a free theme or a

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,140
premium theme if you are willing to go

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,030
full DIY then you probably can get away

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,490
with a free theme if your going to need

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,860
to have some sort of support you're

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,750
gonna want to have a premium theme and

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:36,470
I'm going to turn off sound right now

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:38,780
that's not the sound button cool I can't

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,919
turn off sound with the TV that's

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,580
awesome

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,780
I redid they're not popping up so

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:52,479
another thing you want to look for when

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:55,759
selecting a theme is speed or features

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,300
25% of website traffic after the first 4

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,710
seconds people drop off sometimes even

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,710
quicker depending on how impatient the

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,449
person is so you need to think about how

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,340
long does it take to load your site

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,620
especially when someone is on a mobile

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,779
phone there's a lot of themes out there

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,629
that are kind of a one-size-fits-all

00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,500
theme they've got lots of options that

00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:20,300
come with them so I'm gonna fold

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,279
a lot of them will have any single

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,719
slider that you can imagine and I need

00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,990
to put a disclaimer on here with the

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:30,050
slider if there's a slider on there

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:32,330
don't use the slider I know Kyle talked

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,409
about it earlier and I could agree

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,419
completely sliders they might look cool

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:41,779
not really I don't even think they look

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:44,870
that cool but they slow down your site

00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,729
they're not accessible don't use them so

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,580
if you have something that has all these

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,020
fun sliders on the theme then that means

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,060
that you're loading a lot of extra

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,639
things that you probably don't really

00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:02,539
want on your website because sliders are

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:04,099
bad they're the devil no but he said if

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,240
you don't if you use a if you don't use

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,810
the slider then you go to heaven or

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,419
something like that

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,969
I think I'm paraphrasing and switching

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,680
things together but it works you also

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:14,149
need to ask yourself if you want

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,919
something that is using the WordPress

00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,219
regular editor or if it's something

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,899
that's using a special page builder if

00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,759
you can do what you want with just

00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,659
regular WordPress editor that's

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,229
completely fine

00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:29,659
I'm normally on that boat because I kind

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:32,180
of keep it in the text only mode but

00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,500
some people page builders are easier for

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,930
them it might make it easier to manage

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,399
or it might make it harder also the

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,379
thing to remember with page builders a

00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:41,719
lot of them will slow down your site

00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:47,990
because they might be adding extra bloat

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:50,599
or sliders now that's so what kind of

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,849
user experience are you looking for when

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,390
you're selecting a theme what is the

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,270
purpose

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,820
of the site are you trying to get users

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,950
to learn information are you trying to

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,200
get them to pay you are you trying to

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,820
get them to register are you wanting

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,980
them to read stuff while you have ads on

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,110
the side so you're making revenue what

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,610
style are you looking for do you want

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,590
something that's clean do you want

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,050
something that's modern maybe something

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:19,190
grungy I don't know Western it's

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,690
whimsical what do you need to look for

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,390
in a good theme once you've already

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,820
narrowed down all those things so things

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,880
that you have to pay attention to the

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,460
first is you want something that is

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,100
simple you need simplicity find a niche

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,810
theme if possible for what it is that

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,510
you're looking for what the purpose of

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,970
your website is going to be every option

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,100
or feature that you have on the site it

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,080
can slow it down because there's more

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,660
things that have to be loaded onto your

00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,940
site so ask yourself when you find these

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,470
themes do I need every single feature

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,900
that's on here is there way that these

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,910
features can be disabled you want to

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,840
limit your features because it makes

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,790
your site go faster also you need to

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,980
make sure that the site is responsive

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:10,490
who in this room has a mobile device who

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,850
here has looked at any website on the

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,580
mobile device in the last 24 hours

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:20,650
so everyone it's 2018 that's all I have

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,650
to say make sure your site is responsive

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,930
so responsive means that your site is

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,510
going to look good in a browser or it's

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,890
going to look good on a mobile device

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,650
people are still able to access the

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,390
content they're able to do what is that

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,630
you want them to do when they're

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,190
scrolling through on a phone on a tablet

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,950
it just means that your site is going to

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,910
adjust properly and people will be able

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,840
to use it now browser compatibility is

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,780
the nura thing you have to pay attention

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,870
to does any remember those messages that

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:58,760
were like 20 years old that said this

00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:00,920
website works best on Internet 45.5 so

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,540
this is exactly the same with responsive

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,860
sites you don't want to have some

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,569
disclaimer at this site only works on

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,910
Netscape Navigator

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:13,029
and one because that browsers dead but

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,350
two you don't want to limit it because

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,629
you don't know what people are using

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,249
when they come to visit your site if the

00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:21,009
theme looks bad in the browser that

00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:24,309
you're looking at then that means one of

00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:25,749
two things one the theme is not doesn't

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,449
have any browser compatibility or two

00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:30,009
it's just a bad theme so don't use it

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:30,660
either way though the theme is going to

00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,279
be bad

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,420
so one disclaimer I want to put on there

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,550
is does the site need to look the same

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,499
in every browser and the answer is no it

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,439
does not have to be a pixel perfect

00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:46,689
thing if you have something where it

00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:50,110
still has the general look and feel it's

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:52,449
still on brand then it's correct if you

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,550
think about mobile sites a lot of times

00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:56,019
you're not going to want to squish down

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,509
the whole site so it looks perfect you

00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,970
want an optimal experience for users so

00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:02,920
browser compatibility is not having

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,999
sites look exactly the same across all

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,100
browsers next you want to ask yourself

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,369
what kind of support is offered with

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,790
this theme if it's free your support is

00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:17,350
going to be limited if it is premium you

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,759
want to first find out if support is

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,040
even offered some themes that you

00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,019
purchase you buy the theme and then you

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,970
go with it you also want to find out how

00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:28,240
long support is offered if it is offered

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,459
I found that there's a lot of premium

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
themes that they have extra features

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,839
added to them and so they may actually

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,230
require more support so keep that in

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,689
mind

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,670
limit your features unless it's

00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,490
something that you really need and if

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,959
it's a feature that's in the theme you

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,420
might as well see if there's a plug-in

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,920
available that you can use instead of

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
having it tied directly to your theme

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,670
that way if you change your theme later

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,240
on you still are able to have that

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:58,480
functionality on your website so how do

00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,850
you choose a good theme the first thing

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,459
you want to do is check out the demo

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,170
site that exists click around see how

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:08,259
long it's going to take to load that

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,329
site you also want to resize your

00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:11,799
browser that way you can see if it's

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,959
responsive see what it looks like at

00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,429
different sizes

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,290
unfortunately there's no like every

00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,029
single person has an iPhone with this

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,100
size and everyone has the tablet but all

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,440
the sizes are different so it's usually

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,820
just grab that bottom corner and shrink

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,640
it down and that way you can just see

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,560
how things just on the page you also

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,350
want to open that site that demo site in

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,410
other browsers see if it looks good on

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,170
those as well if it's a free theme then

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,690
try it on develop site development site

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,620
that you might have if you've got one of

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:46,510
the three tools like desktop server or

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,120
local by flywheels setup then you can

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,070
create a site free theme on there or if

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,810
it's a premium theme and you purchased

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,360
it already you can install on there and

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,760
see how it works out also realize that

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,280
if you have a premium theme a lot of

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,370
times their demo it has all these nice

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,260
zero images and call to actions and then

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,060
when you installed on your site it's not

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,860
going to look like that some of them

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,480
will have a way to import in their

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,450
defaults and then you have to modify

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,250
those but a lot of times there is extra

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,590
setup required to make your site look

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,130
like the demo site if that's what you're

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:26,050
going for another thing to look for is

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,540
ratings and reviews find out what the

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,030
rating of that theme is and also read

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,590
those reviews that are on there find out

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,080
what problems people have any of the

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,720
pain points that they had with

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,780
installing or using these names and also

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,420
if there is a theme that has lots and

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,060
lots of five-star reviews and there's no

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,470
real reason why it's five-star it very

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,000
well could have been spammed with those

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,370
five-star reviews so take that into

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,200
consideration and the same goes on the

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,240
opposite if it has lots of one-star

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,630
reviews with no reasoning it might have

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,530
been trolled into having a lower rating

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,510
another thing to do is if there's

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,090
negative reviews on there

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,330
see if whoever built the theme whatever

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,270
company or person has responded to those

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,010
requests that way you can see if well

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,880
what kind of support you might get from

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:18,130
that other considerations that you want

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,040
is plugin support is there a specific

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,180
plugin that you need to use if so you

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,010
might want to find out if it's going to

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,510
work with that theme usually you should

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,610
be okay but there's things that you

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,680
might have to keep in mind a good

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,960
example is a lot of the page builders

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,790
sometimes plugins don't play as nicely

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,670
to be integrated into them

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,320
is your theme translation ready if you

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,890
are planning on supporting multiple

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:57,250
languages and is it SEO friendly how to

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:59,410
find out what these ask around yeah so

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,510
most most of the modern themes have come

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,370
out developers are pretty good about

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,680
making sure that they follow standards

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,380
some of the older ones you have to be

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,480
worried about but you just want to make

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,620
sure and a good way is just ask the

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,270
developer straight out if you're

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,760
planning on purchasing or if it's a free

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,660
one just see what other people have or

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,740
ask or ask someone to just quickly look

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,000
at it and they can tell you just by

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,240
looking at the code base a lot of times

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,730
or ask a developer I guess so what are

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,670
ways that you can customize the theme

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,950
the first is there's the customizer most

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,380
modern themes they support the

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:38,800
customizer and you have the option to

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:42,190
control a lot of the colors the styles

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,900
in there one thing to point out is if

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,240
it's a theme that's been created by

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,550
developer specifically for you it's been

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,620
tailored then you might have less

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,410
options than normal and that's because

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,780
it's been made for you so you may not

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,370
always have as many options in the

00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,140
customizer in that situation or

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,790
sometimes you might have a theme where

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,620
they don't support as much besides the

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,170
defaults that come with WordPress so

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,030
don't expect to always have complete

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,370
control using the customizer but that's

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:14,140
what the developer has given you access

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:17,530
to also you can add custom CSS to a

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,780
theme and it was in version 4.8 I

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:24,940
believe WordPress where they added it

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,790
into the conditional CSS and if you

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,230
actually know CSS you can type it in and

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:34,300
you can make the modifications to your

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:36,700
theme and it goes live awesome if you

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,580
have jetpack installed and you know what

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,320
a CSS preprocessor is jetpack gives you

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,010
access to those if you don't know what

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,510
that is then ignore what I just said

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,620
another way to customize theme is with a

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,220
child theme

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,470
now if you want to add your own styles

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,750
using a stylesheet or if you're adding

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,580
extra functionality to a theme you want

00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,710
to create a child theme and the reason

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,450
being these themes have been created by

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,700
someone else let's say that they find a

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,530
bug summer on there and they push an

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,440
update that update thing goes through

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:11,980
and all of your modified code is gone

00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,590
that theme that I'd created in 2009 for

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,330
my portfolio site my favorite color is

00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,860
blue and so I was like okay well we'll

00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,790
change some of these blacks to blues and

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,680
we'll make it look a little bit

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,870
different than the standard that's out

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,760
there was just a free theme and then

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,070
there was the Update button I'm like oh

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,750
I should probably update and I lost all

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,930
those changes then learn that one the

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,750
hard way so if you're making changes to

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,940
files rather than actually changing the

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,150
files create a child theme if you don't

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,710
know how let's talk to someone here who

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,180
knows how to do it and we can help you

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,860
also

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,870
chrome dev tools Firefox dev tools

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,690
whatever dev tools you want to use is

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,180
another great way to quickly see the

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,820
changes I know Kyle had mentioned in his

00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,680
talk earlier about using chrome dev

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,660
tools to quickly prototype something

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,220
because you're able to go in and change

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:09,430
them and see it happen in real time so

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,210
the way to access this and sometimes

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,740
they'll appear on the right side

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,240
sometimes appear on the bottom there's

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,730
way that you can change that to your

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,300
preference but if you do command shift C

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,400
on a Mac or ctrl shift C on a PC it

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,590
opens dev tools and will automatically

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,180
have the element inspector or you can

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:30,460
just right click and click inspect

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:34,080
element if you click on any of these

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:38,620
properties on the side then for instance

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,480
font size is 0.6 RM you can actually use

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,960
arrow keys to move up and down and it

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,840
will change it in real time for you now

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,480
if you use the WordPress custom CSS

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,460
editor all the changes that you type you

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,320
will be able to see them happen but it

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,970
takes a little bit of a second for it to

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,040
read through all the CSS and then apply

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,420
it to your site while this it'll happen

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,280
in real time and just automatically

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,539
change it then when you find the changes

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,539
that you like

00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:08,200
you just move them over to the custom

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:10,630
CSS and you're good to go the thing to

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,000
point out is if you are using I believe

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,529
it's Safari then you have to actually go

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,870
up into their preferences and enable

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,730
their dev tools and I'm not quite sure

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,100
where it is because I never use Safari

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,480
but that's something to point out is

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,100
sometimes you might have to find a way

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,100
to enable the dev tools from the road

00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:33,880
after themes there's plugins and plugins

00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,159
are also nice because they can add any

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,169
sort of functionality website just about

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:42,700
whatever you can think of and there's so

00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:45,940
many of them in fact there's 55,000 of

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,649
them so that's just the free ones on the

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,330
WordPress repository there's a lot of

00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,360
other sources to get more of the premium

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:59,789
ones and how do you know which is a good

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,789
plug-in to install on your site exactly

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,960
it's further on in my talk but yes so

00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:10,120
first thing you need to do is find out a

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,220
list of what it is that you need for

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,070
this plug-in so how do you choose the

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,830
plug-in make a list of exactly what your

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,840
must-haves are and find a plug-in that

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,120
can at least check off one of those

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,130
must-haves preferably something that's

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,529
not adding extra features unless it's

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,679
something that you want it's pointless

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:31,240
to put on a plugin that is close to

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,370
having what you want if it doesn't hit

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,570
your must-haves because trying to hack

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,649
plugins together it's possible but a lot

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,399
of them don't like to play nice with

00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:43,899
each other so just like with themes you

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,990
need to find out what your budget is for

00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:48,639
these plugins do you have no budget and

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,940
you want to go free you want to set them

00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:54,669
all up yourself or do you need support

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,380
look for a premium plugin keep in mind

00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,740
though that a lot of the premium plugins

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:03,340
they require you to pay yearly for

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,889
support updates and that is very good I

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,750
would recommend not canceling that after

00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:11,710
it expires because even though the

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,899
plugin will still work your support is

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,620
going to end at that moment and let's

00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:18,529
say that your

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,330
ocular plugin to do something and a

00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,429
voter ability is found since it's

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,100
popular enough your site could get

00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:27,019
targeted so you might as well that that

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,249
plugin is always up to date so it's

00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,110
something to remember is if you're

00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:32,029
purchasing premium plugins or premium

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,360
themes for that matter you want to make

00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:36,289
sure that you're keeping things updated

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,909
another thing to ask when choosing a

00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:42,470
plugin is any intricate in it that any

00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:44,330
integrations do you need to have I'm not

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,700
talking about just social media but you

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,700
got to think about processes is there

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,009
something that you need with custom

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,840
forms going on with payments or do you

00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:58,519
need to have advanced searching or

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,350
filters you need things that are talking

00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:03,740
to other plugins that might be created

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,299
you need to know this because as I said

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,559
before plugins don't always play nice

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,509
together so if they say that they're

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,309
going to work then a lot of times that

00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:14,749
helps out and you just want to find out

00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:16,820
will this work with this so how to

00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:21,590
choose a good plugin and the first one

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:23,840
is check out the ratings read what these

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,240
recent reviews are find out what people

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,249
had to say and find out what it is they

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,889
liked and didn't like about the plug-in

00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:32,869
if just like with themes if there's lots

00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:35,149
of five-star reviews or one-star reviews

00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,840
with no reason there might be a reason

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:37,639
for it

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,330
that is not related to the plug-in

00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:43,220
itself see if support has responded to

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,990
negative requests and another thing is

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,820
with plugins specifically a lot of times

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,919
they're developers or some of the top

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,529
plugins will actually have social media

00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,259
council on facebook or twitter and you

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:56,570
can see how they've responded to people

00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:58,100
with those so it's another resource that

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,789
you have on getting support and seeing

00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:04,519
how support interacts with people next

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:07,909
is find out when this plugin was last

00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:12,230
updated now it preferably should be

00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:14,749
within the last two years but honestly

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,879
it means be sooner than that really the

00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:19,399
tested up to value should be the latest

00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,720
version of WordPress it is tested up to

00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,490
latest version of WordPress that means

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,379
that your plugin author or company

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,820
they're always checking the plugin

00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:29,539
they're actively working on it and it's

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,549
not a bad plugin find out if the plug

00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:35,779
is popular see how many active installs

00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:37,609
exist for it now active installs it

00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:40,669
means this is actually running on

00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:42,999
another website and so if those 3

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,350
million websites are not broken then

00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:48,109
that's probably a good sign that the

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,940
plug-in is good to use now one thing to

00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:52,159
point out is you might have a plugin

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,129
that you found that hits a lot of your

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,169
must-haves for features and it doesn't

00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:59,299
have many active installs it might be

00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,849
something that's a new plugin or it's so

00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:05,210
niche that not as many people are going

00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:06,739
to use it so active installs it's good

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,779
if it's really high but if it's really

00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:11,019
low it's not the end of the world it

00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:13,669
depends on the situation

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:15,440
another thing to do is ask around find

00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:18,320
out if people know any good plugins that

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,899
exist maybe someone knows one that's

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,820
going to help your situation so you can

00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:24,889
ask people here at WordCamp Detroit if

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,159
they have any favorites ask people

00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:30,190
social media email someone these are the

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,539
ones that I use on just about every site

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:39,889
jetpack Yoast SEO gravity forms and my

00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:41,989
great WV pro and that last one is more

00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:43,549
developer oriented so you probably don't

00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:45,649
need that but it helps moving from a

00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,869
development site to a live site but the

00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:50,210
other ones jetpack is a suite of plugins

00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:52,580
that will go and gives you a bunch of

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,529
additional features and the nice thing

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,179
is you can turn on or off those features

00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,669
so it's not something that you have to

00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,019
install everything and have lots of

00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:02,179
bloat on your site you can determine

00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:05,029
what it is that you want on or off Yoast

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,830
SEO it's probably one of the better SEO

00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:09,379
plugins out there if you install that it

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,950
will give you a list of criteria to help

00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:14,450
improve your search engine off

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:17,690
the best way to improve your search

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:21,169
engine optimization is to just write

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:25,190
good content and be consistent if you

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:26,659
want to rank start up a blog find the

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,970
best content that you can write about

00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,679
such-and-such a topic and keep going

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,559
from there build an audience that way

00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,289
it's going to take time but there is no

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,820
really fast way to jump in your SEO and

00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:41,149
then gravity forms is just an easy

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,150
plug-in to have forms with lots of

00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:46,460
features if you want to add them

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,350
so what happens if you are in way over

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,580
your head

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,290
themes and plugins they control most

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,480
your site and if you can't get things

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:56,179
working like that it might be time that

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,370
you need to talk to a developer happens

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,660
to every time I'm honestly not sure how

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:06,290
many times I've had to ask Kyle help for

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:08,360
a random thing that I've come across in

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,350
fact there's just a couple months ago I

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,340
asked tomography for help with

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,520
integrating react into a wordpress

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,890
plugin and more than happy to help the

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,679
WordPress community is a great community

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,600
and so make connections at work camps

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,400
like this talk to people and if you have

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,860
questions ask them a lot of them will

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,200
help out sometimes though you might have

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,660
to find a developer you just need to pay

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,700
and have them take care of it so when do

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,820
you want to find developer the first is

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,429
if you have no time I mean no time could

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,809
be you got into a project and you

00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,880
realize that this deadline is the lot

00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:46,549
sooner than what you expected and you

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,040
just don't know how to do it or it's

00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:50,630
something that it might be faster if you

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,929
outsource to another company and have

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:55,820
them take care of it for you or you just

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:58,610
are planning learning something but you

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,320
don't have time to learn it another

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,880
thing is if it has crazy functionality

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,500
if you've got something that's so

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,570
intense that you don't know where to

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,929
begin with building for this process

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,580
talk to someone else this is really

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:14,090
common with integrations that happen

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,740
between api's of other sites so if

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,390
you're trying to integrate with some

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,179
third-party source and have it work into

00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,280
your site a lot of those have

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,630
documentation some don't and it's not

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,260
fun trying to make them talk to each

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,440
other or sometimes you might just have

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,630
things that are not working at all and

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,980
you've tried you've tried you've looked

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,710
around you've worked around you've tried

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,840
as may stackoverflow solutions as exists

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,990
that are probably wrong and in the end

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,730
you just give up or you pay someone else

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,540
to do it

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:48,320
so how do you prequalify a developer

00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,679
there's things you want to ask

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,750
developers before you start your project

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,870
and the first is find out what kind of

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,090
experience they have if they're more

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:02,480
it might cost you more if they're less

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,980
experienced it'll be cheaper and it

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,529
might be a good learning experience for

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,559
them but it also could take longer and

00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:11,779
depending on the situation and how the

00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:13,789
developers work ethic is it might not

00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:16,029
get done but also gonna happen with some

00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,379
of the experienced developers too though

00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,850
by now if they're experienced with

00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:21,980
WordPress are they involved in the

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,509
community have they ever done anything

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,690
that's similar to the requests that

00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:28,879
you're looking for also find out how

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,549
long the time is going to take get a

00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:33,470
timeline if you have a closed due date

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,809
as I said before your cost is probably

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,419
going to be a lot higher but if you have

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:40,460
no deadlines that project might get put

00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:43,249
on the back burner by you and/or them I

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,289
recommend getting a timeline and making

00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:47,749
sure that there's deliverables from both

00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:49,970
parties because that shows that you're

00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:51,950
invested as well as them and it helps

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,769
both parties try to build that site

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,649
together and it means that your timeline

00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:59,330
has a better chance of being met also

00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,879
find out what kind of support is going

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,009
to come with the site is it something

00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:06,409
where you're just going to have the

00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,999
files handed to you afterwards and you

00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:12,799
install them or are they going to be

00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:14,419
training you are they going to be giving

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,749
you any sort of like input during the

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,100
development process find out how closely

00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:21,529
related it's going to be when you're

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,610
working with this developer and then

00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:26,119
also find out if they're going to be

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:28,129
working on a local site or a dev site or

00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:30,230
if they're gonna be working and making

00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:31,610
these changes on your live site if they

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,710
say they're just gonna work on the live

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:37,100
site immediately run away you don't want

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,240
to work with that developer also find

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,429
out what their previous work is

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,289
especially any that might relate to your

00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:44,149
current project if you see something

00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:46,490
that you're kind of curious about why

00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,409
they approached it that way ask them if

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,789
they can convince you on this as the

00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,289
reason why that means that they probably

00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,049
know what they're talking about or

00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,519
sometimes they might just be like the

00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:00,049
client insisted and this is what we

00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:01,779
ended up with in the end also find out

00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,769
they're going to be working from scratch

00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:06,830
specifically for themes or if they're

00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:08,600
going to be using a template if they're

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,580
doing it from scratch it's going to cost

00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,100
more but it will be custom tailored

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,710
to your brand and will give you exactly

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,960
what you need if it's something from a

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,380
template your turnaround time might be a

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,330
lot quicker though so things to just

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,780
weigh and find out which works best for

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,530
you

00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:30,260
and then the last one is do they

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:34,430
outsource outsourcing it can lower the

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:37,730
costs but at the same time it might

00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,700
cause issues because that person is not

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,560
necessarily doing the work anymore so

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,920
asking questions do you outsource if

00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,260
they do outsource find out if they've

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,720
got like version control going on and if

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,190
they know if there's a way they are

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,900
keeping their code in check so that way

00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,620
someone doesn't overwrite someone else's

00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:00,200
changes I guess I had a couple more also

00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,480
find out if they code seo-friendly if

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,080
your site is responsive if there's

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,090
browser compatibility you need to make

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,820
sure that your site is mobile-friendly

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,610
and you need to make sure that your

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,540
going to be found so make sure that they

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,370
understand those things and are willing

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,220
to integrate that into the theme or

00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:22,100
plugin also find out if they offer

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:25,820
maintenance plans or if they charge

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,050
ongoing for service find out in advance

00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,150
what those things are so that way you

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,470
can budget properly because you don't

00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,790
want to have something where you finish

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,740
it and they're like okay and can you

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,690
continue support it's now gonna be this

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,420
much per month find out beforehand so

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,950
you don't get scared

00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:43,880
finally find out how much everything

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,290
costs because if you get a quote

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,360
immediately before they know what the

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,620
full project is then that means that

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,450
they're just grabbing a number off the

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,510
top of their head and it's probably not

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,800
someone who you want to work with but if

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,000
you've actually went through and told

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,520
them what the project is and they've

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,460
given you these detailed information

00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,360
about it then it might be a safer quote

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:07,730
find out what the cost is going to be if

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,210
things go bad and you need to terminate

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:12,650
a relationship also find out how much

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,120
things are going to be if you've got

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,010
changes that you want to make that are

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,710
not inside the scope of what the project

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,410
is and I'm going to tell you a secret

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,990
now on how much everything should cost

00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:26,600
for websites and the

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,330
answer is whatever you get the most

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,370
value out of if it's something where

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,620
it's a lower dollar amount but you feel

00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,240
like you've got the value you need it's

00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,460
good if it's something that it's more

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,160
expensive but you got what you need it's

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,530
good also find out if there's warranty

00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,330
find out if they're going to give you

00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,610
money back if something breaks or if

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:50,270
they've got support for bugs that might

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:53,750
occur so the best choice for a developer

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,490
is just like with value there isn't a

00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,870
right answer you got to find out the

00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,910
budget you got to find out the needs of

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,820
the project and you've got to find out

00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,540
how will you mess with the person some

00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,130
are too blunt

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,070
others might sweet-talk everything to a

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:10,070
fault so find out what style fits best

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,170
with yours and then last thing make sure

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,490
you have a contract the contract it will

00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,110
protect the developer but it'll also

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,500
protect you in case things don't get

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:21,190
done so find out which developer gives

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,840
you the most value for the project so

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:26,510
DIY WordPress whether you're just

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,690
selecting a theme or some plugins or if

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:32,510
you're a full-on developer you can have

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,340
your own WordPress site if you hire

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,780
developer to build your site it can

00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,760
still be DIY because that's what

00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,559
WordPress is all about it's about giving

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,050
you the power to make the changes on

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:47,750
your site so the things to remember

00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:50,179
though is if that guy that guy or this

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,670
guy can have and build a WordPress

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:55,429
website then so can you

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,870
I'm Saif Ali I'm a publisher engineer at

00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:01,360
media vine you can find me online at
