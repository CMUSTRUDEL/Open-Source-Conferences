Description: 
	The ease of WordPress has catered to quick learners and do-it-yourselfers. It’s what makes WordPress so great and universal. However, many questions come with the DYI approach: What should I look for when selecting a theme? How I find good plugins to extend my site’s functionality? When is it better to hire someone else to develop my website? How can I prequalify a developer? Knowing the answers to these question can save you from a few headaches.
