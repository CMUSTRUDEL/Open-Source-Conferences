yes creates marketing director and I'm

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,070
going to give you a little bit of

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,500
history I was talking about how they got

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,169
detect I was a music major that's useful

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,000
and using the theater and I've been in

00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,160
sales for I got into sales

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,320
basically because you just have a lie

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:43,640
and the sales department is an extra

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,500
face pills so I got I was when I worked

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,820
in telecommunications so I would isolate

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,650
phone systems and fiber optic networks

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,970
around the state and I got really bored

00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:05,449
and I decided to go to websites it's not

00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:08,300
as boring and I was originally a really

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,880
bad about WordPress for a long time we

00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,909
parted ways built carry studios was

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,100
looking for someone to sell websites and

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,549
it turns out that I'm the only person

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,049
that actually had that as a job so they

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,460
hired me and when I started my job

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:29,120
wasn't supposed to be cold calling

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:34,010
nonprofits to sell website packages

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,090
today that doesn't work so that will not

00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:40,520
be one of the things that's on these

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,310
slides so when I started they were a

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,990
project only they literally did

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,890
everything in products and when project

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,689
the project project and they did about

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,500
300,000 those aren't real numbers your

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:56,670
point seven they it's actually pretty

00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,900
close but they'd about 300,000

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:05,399
career from the steps that we took to

00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,550
the time I walked in we have doubled and

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:13,470
we are planning on doubling again this

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,800
year to our goals here are to reach a

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,239
million dollars in sales and the ways we

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,530
did it are going to be explained here

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:29,010
how many of you are actually agencies

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:31,080
raise your hands please I will chop

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,190
four-letter words if you're offended I'm

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,860
sorry

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,330
just how I talk I want to do not

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,620
agencies and businesses and thinking

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,660
this is going to teach you how to do

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,690
your business better and you can be a

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,180
your same if you're working as a sole

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,190
remember you're a freelancer this little

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,299
YouTube but if you're like I work for

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,769
Compuware please leave and bring us out

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:58,170
some things that you don't want to know

00:02:54,769 --> 00:03:00,630
so the first thing that we have to do

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,530
and this is sound simple because we had

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,600
an oath we work we even know are we a

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,970
development agency that is a designer

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,040
are we assigning agency that's

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,700
development are we marketing what what

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,720
the hell are we

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,920
and also what was the language that we

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,630
wanted to use this is it seems simple we

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,820
should go out we know who we are we know

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,260
the kind of people that work here it's

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,239
actually taking those two years we've

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,010
gone through several iterations of our

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,900
language and when I first started when I

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,760
first came on I said okay well we need

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,049
to create all this content we need to us

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,700
to do this is how we're going to talk

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,970
about it we're gonna use all the

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,650
buzzwords and it was it was a terrible

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,260
flocking term we hated it

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,780
that's just not us we're the tough love

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,000
agency we're going to tell you how it is

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,220
we're in the you know we're

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,720
or not there would be your friend where

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:58,020
they're making money and so we had to

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,520
learn what who we were and we had a

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,980
Creek content around though that

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,720
language and the other thing that we had

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,360
to find was our thresholds never I said

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,660
I walked into that job and I was mostly

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,460
selling website packages and I'm gonna

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,140
say comer and I know a lot of people

00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:20,880
it's going to seem like it's 10 that was

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,530
announced by the website turns out

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,050
nobody want to buy those

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,640
not because $10,000 is a lot of money

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,890
it's because it wasn't a break that

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,270
wasn't what we were companies the

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,700
organizations that we were working with

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,900
they weren't at that threshold but the

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,050
companies that we needed to work with

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,850
were they weren't interested in packages

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,100
way to learn who we learned what our

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,530
thresholds work so no we don't sell

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,560
$10,000 sets never going to come here

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,510
it's generally about 25 grand and then

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,669
you know it's funny you're gonna find

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,530
out any of them you can find out how

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,150
much the website is that our website you

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,100
can come to us you ask a question we're

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,780
gonna give you that answer the other

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,440
threshold we had to figure out what is

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,860
our top tier I give you a little story

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,500
when I came on develop trade I have

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,900
about 90 days to make this whole process

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,880
work the first 60 days I was doing that

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,830
cold calling thing you know it's also

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,660
great content and doing the things and

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,860
say hey guys you know this thing that I

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,050
do for you guys

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,240
you know it will pay us to do this this

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,350
inbound marketing thing that you know

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,030
are getting leads and things of that

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,790
nature it will actually pay us to do

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,990
this know fast fair amount and then and

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:33,180
Eric our owner he was like okay we'll

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,100
sign up for this specific software you

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,150
got 30 days it doesn't work we're gonna

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,050
cut ties

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,400
we're done you go back to the

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,440
interpreter day 21 signed a very large

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,169
contract with a very large statewide

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,479
company we have to learn that top

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,400
threshold they would not a good fit I

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,910
couldn't control them I couldn't manage

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,060
them

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,800
there were to date there was so you have

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,540
to know where your balance is now the

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,430
kingdom's today we've got more employees

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,050
we did a thing who probably a better fit

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,750
but that wasn't our threshold at the

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,169
time can we had to learn very quickly

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:11,010
how to say no and I'm going to say no

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,440
very easy by the end of this the second

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,289
thing we had to do was find a recurring

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,720
revenue source this doesn't have to be a

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,580
huge thing you don't have to go in and

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,690
be like we're going to charge $10,000 a

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,350
month we'll use marketing and blah blah

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,150
blah

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,680
no you can how many of you use an

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,020
outside hosting company please tell me

you don't post in your house right

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,380
everyone uses an outside posting company

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,430
how many of you are charging your

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:42,000
clients to post their website a monthly

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,270
recurring fee sometimes you have

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,120
maintenance building to that yeah if you

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,950
don't have me when I walked in they said

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,289
no I don't like 100's you hosting

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,180
they're like well we just we're like one

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,610
of them signup horrible get all the

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,020
stuff set up on you know liquid web or

00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,700
whatever you know on those servers that

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,949
we did server advisor we want working

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,110
but we don't charge Manila

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,720
well there's a lot of great partners

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,240
that are downstairs that can create a

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,039
structure for you to make money off of

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,509
the hosting and all of the maintenance

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,190
maintenance doesn't take that long

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,930
you built the website well it's not

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,789
going to take that much you can charge

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,300
people and now you have a monthly to

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:25,479
give up just a small revenue stream that

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,889
you can draw on because what I'm going

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:32,979
to try to work everyone through is you

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,570
can't scale your company if you don't

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:37,090
have a scalable amount of money coming

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,430
in every month if you're going from

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,199
project to project you may have a banner

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,240
first quarter you know oh my god I got

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,780
higher tune got a higher to developers

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,669
again to all this stuff except the next

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,210
quarter it takes a dip and that was

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:55,599
literally the heaven flow that that

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,389
artwork on our company had every single

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,449
year was they did this all year long

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:04,750
family and and they've great years they

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:07,150
had big time years but they didn't have

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,210
monthly recurring revenues allows to

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,599
make an upward trajectory less than 10%

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:17,349
of our monthly revenues and 2015 we're

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,770
coming for month our 10% of our revenues

00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:23,020
every month were monthly revenues by

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,849
2017 is about it was about half and

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,500
that's kind of the threshold that we

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,510
want to thank even I want people about

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,159
half of our of the money that's coming

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:36,159
in is coming from existing client bases

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,490
and the thing that it did or our owners

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,669
he is to sleep now it's to rest

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,850
he knows his bills are paid is you know

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,040
rent is paid the lights are on all

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,660
these are taken care of doesn't it worry

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,720
about payroll these things are done

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,090
they're not and they don't then I'm

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,470
going anywhere those people are locked

00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,910
into agreements they're locked into

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,800
contracts so that we can scale and to

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,140
kind of give you an example we when I

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,940
started with about one and a half whole

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,310
town employees maybe two whole time

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,790
employees and a couple of contractors we

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,410
have we just signed a new lease to move

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,690
out of town because they can't find

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,550
space to think about because we have six

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,950
seven full time employees ever going on

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,050
and we're hydrated by the way if

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,060
anyone's in marketing you come see me

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,300
afterward we're looking for another

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:33,760
marketer but I'm gonna nother medium so

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:36,600
I can see the vacation so the steps to

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,400
doing it or to create content so right

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,060
don't like writing I'm sorry this is not

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,100
good talk for you you need to write we

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,470
create and when we do an inbound

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,910
campaign we generally tell people you

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,910
shouldn't be creating at least two or

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,120
three pieces of content every single day

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm sorry

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,420
we do have one piece of content - two

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,600
pieces of chocolate every single day

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,760
internally we literally utter there's

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,190
somebody writing every single day

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,780
and the S is good for SEO the second

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,730
thing that is that we can use it more

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,590
because we're strategic cannot be

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,090
writing as we can reuse that content to

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,910
nurture our deeds to work them down the

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,530
sales funnel to email triple campaigns

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,580
and I'm sure some of you this room get

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,150
all the time we get to use that that

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,980
content to continue to nurture leads and

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,630
they may be bad leads but we don't have

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,640
to worry about it as an homage to taking

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:42,640
care of it and we get to be that change

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,900
that we see we want to tell people hey

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,610
you you know you should be doing this

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,800
you should be paying us to do this but

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,860
we have to be the first one to do it we

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,090
have to show people that that that this

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,660
is what you should be doing this is how

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,550
it works

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,580
and we have the case studies including

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,150
ourselves that say yeah this works

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,380
because traffic went up 40 percent and

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,050
our leads went from like about two

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:11,350
important on tech once a month to we get

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,780
about six leads a week now not all of

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,530
them are qualified and in the next steps

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,240
said we're going to figure out how we

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,850
get how do we filter those people out

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,950
those leads are coming from vertical

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,500
shaded content so we've all their

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,900
content you take the best of it you put

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:33,160
it behind a pay wall and that pay wall

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,250
is give me your who you are tell me who

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,140
you are

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,940
and we will sell you all the data you

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,810
want on can anyone tell me what the

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,970
first

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,690
never asks you when they want to talk

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:49,240
about building the website anybody how

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,540
much does it cost how many of you are

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,070
afraid to tell someone's website stuff

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,410
why do you know how much your

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,480
competitors to charge for a website so

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,570
they know how much you charge right so

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,940
okay and if they're below the threshold

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,770
you tell them hey this website cost this

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,480
month and then below the threshold you

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,400
want to deal with you can have email

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,600
marketing do the thing because if

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,980
they're really passionate about what

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,690
they want and they're like man I can

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,520
only four or five or five thousand two

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,170
thousand thousand dollars but it cost

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,580
for you a thousand you know twice that

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,640
if they really want to work with you

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,290
they really want to go find the money if

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,150
they're passionate about their business

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,580
and if this is serious or that they're

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,680
gonna find the money so if you continue

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,800
to nurture them through automations you

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,610
know workflows things of that nature you

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,700
personally as the business owner don't

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,440
have to do jack just let it go and if

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,770
they're happy if they won't you have

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,660
they're gonna come back which is

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,960
lausanne about remarketing to them and

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,480
there's two ways to remarket and at

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,250
least for me into one is the email

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,160
marketing that i'm talking about the

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,210
second thing is if any of you are not

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,420
using Google AdWords remarketing for

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,590
your business you should do that now

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:10,840
and I'm gonna let you in on a secret

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:15,000
it's super damn cheap really cheap we've

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:19,720
set a budget of about $2 a day never max

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,690
our AdWords costs can be called thousand

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,450
dollars monthly for search ads our

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,680
remarketing ads bus is virtually nothing

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,900
because the whole point is that it's a

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,870
brand it's remarketing it's a brand cup

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,490
reinforcer if you will it every time you

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,800
go to another website you see that

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,870
filtering that you and I didn't pull all

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,490
the time to complain we do and please

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,210
lay off I can't go to a website well

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:54,910
senior student greeting pads no that

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:58,240
means I'm in tough and you use all of

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,800
this this information and you can endure

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,270
to those leads is like I said they

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,750
really really really want what you've

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,340
got

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,400
they're gonna find a way to get the

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,200
money to do it and we've learnt to talk

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,460
about automation and I'm gonna dig into

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:16,530
that a little bit deeper down the road

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:19,510
oh if the tools that make you money

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:24,430
WordPress is fantastic it's for the most

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,420
part free but find some tools that are

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,760
going to make you money

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,050
find a good hosting partner that's that

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,210
first step finding that first residual

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,550
you know amount of money that you can

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,230
help them okay so it sounds bad as I

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,830
thought 100 bucks mom Plus that you

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,660
build all the websites of them in a year

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,190
that's 1200 dollars looks for very you

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,490
know the next year's four dollars a

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,410
month

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,840
this is recurring revenue that you can

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,020
use to

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,730
pay for a part-time developer to do your

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,830
part of the maintenance and you're still

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,510
thinking that means profit profit is

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,430
good and then fun good marketing tools

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,160
because I don't know I'm kind of skipped

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,100
over the point by the way SEO PPC

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,500
inbound marketing this is not that hard

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,550
I literally taught myself my job by

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,860
watching YouTube video it took a little

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,480
while spent a lot of time doing it this

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,550
isn't rocket science if you can do build

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,180
and develop website you can do SEO it's

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:26,250
just not that hard and the beautiful

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,130
part of WordPress is that it gives you

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,670
so many great tools already they kind of

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,920
make tin ghost being one of them and not

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,320
because they're sponsored but seriously

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,370
love them because their sponsor they're

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,589
it's four on page SEO it's super it's

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,900
free and you get to learn some of those

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:49,350
you smell the character that you should

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,330
okay order my keywords one it's they

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,710
give it to you if you come from the

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,660
custom side like I do they don't have

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,280
those tools you just got to know the

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,560
information and that's where I think a

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,630
lot of the people got this idea that

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,140
search engine optimization is rocket

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,510
science

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,190
now I'm gonna tell every client I'm glad

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,930
there's no businesses in here that it

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,930
really is rocket science and do really

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,610
are work that was

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:15,160
do this but it's not and any if you're a

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,410
single I just do this by myself it

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,380
builds websites for small businesses and

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,210
if you can if you can build that website

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,120
you can optimize it and help them in the

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,760
market and what are some of the tools

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,770
that we use number ones

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,440
the reason I'm going to say expect it's

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,270
a great tool as it makes money again

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,880
it's a business even here they have a

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:40,029
model that allows us to charge more than

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,220
what we pay for it so for a small

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,480
business who's just getting started you

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,570

five minutes ten licenses and it's $79 a

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:53,529
month this is this lookup this weapon is

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,550
a it's screen captures every visitor so

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,720
you need to see how people are

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,440
interacting with your website it does

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,760
eat mapping does click mapping these are

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,709
these are not only powerful tools for

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,050
your user experience and your marketing

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:07,120

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,670
to take into a sales meeting and go look

proposals give you all this information

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:22,449

money off of everybody else that profit

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,770
is necessary because the seven hundred

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,730
and ninety dollars a month or whatever

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,640
is you know part of a payroll for

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,020
another concept forever

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,910
now we can scale them take on more

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,970
clients we can make more money

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,140

00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:58,210
websites and making an ism as optimized

00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:01,899
for search engines you know possible

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,309
they're constantly checking website data

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,220
they're doing all the things they're

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:08,230
giving all these insights and the last

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,809
one is Sharpsburg now this is actually a

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,700
tool that kind of took this to the next

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,820
level and this is the thing that I had

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,169
30 days to prove that this works and

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,159
worse I'm here talking to you now so

00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,960
obviously it did and gives it agency I

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,350
don't know if you're familiar with tough

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,470
spot okay it's big buzzword they charge

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,139
a ton of money

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:35,019
Jeffrey's competitor most populous basis

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:37,570
is is that we are four agencies our

00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:40,360
pricing model is four agencies we want

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,399
to help agencies grow it's pretty much

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,899
the same functionality it's Marketo part

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:48,970
a tough spot but a tenth of the cost and

00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:54,370
they sell you your chart which you want

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:56,590
we don't care so you can and anyone who

00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,879
wants a demo bonus if you're interested

00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,500
in something like this you come see me

00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:02,860
afterward and I will get you a demo from

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,049
shark spring and you know I'll give the

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,279
referral and send it off to one more to

00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,309
our comp reps and they'll give you a

00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,320
demo of the software I hope you

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:14,440
understand the pricing model I won't

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,820
really go and really go into that but

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,120
it's an incredibly aggressive pricing

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,820
model to help agencies because once you

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,279
for us once we've locked our clients

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,049
into we give them so much data they know

00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,789
who visits you know when they visit

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,710
whatever page they visit they know all

00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:30,119
this information

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,899
Anna's got marketing automation tools

00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,070
email tools and one of more important

00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:36,659
things for business owners

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,570
it's where did my large marketing

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,220
dollars get spent marketing attribution

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,860
and this tool gave us marketing

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,450
attribution that says you know are you

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,450
familiar with John Wonka he was a it was

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,570
a good magnate in retail and then the

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,860
turn of the century he said half my

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,009
Evernote advertising dollars are wasted

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,259
problems I don't know which app what

00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:02,940
some of these tools that are going to

00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,740
help you as a business and then also

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,690
help you grow as a business because you

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,399
can resell this to other people is that

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,070
you get to tell them this is where your

00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:14,549
marketing dollars work and oh by the way

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,080
if they're welcome organic please guess

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,789
it was good we're look at what we did

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,840
breathe you should stay working with us

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:26,580
and pay us more money so kind of wrap

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,279
things up in conclusion if you don't

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,590
know who you are then how can your

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,360
customers ever know who you are

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,470
and how are you going to know how are

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,379
they gonna know that they're a good fit

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,679
for you remove them and if you're living

00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:43,440
project project how can you grow safely

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,059
that's it's worthy heart anyone ask

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,009
anybody who's been doing this for you

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:49,100
know six eight ten years growing

00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:52,499
organically is very very difficult

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,679
without some sort of safety mechanism in

00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:59,279
the terms of monthly recurring relatives

00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:02,399
and but I can't stress this enough or

00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:06,929
create content create content it's got

00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:07,600
the so much value and then answer the

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:10,060
question

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,280
you have and filter out those that are

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:17,710
qualified not everybody's a good fit or

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:20,890
build great studios we know of those 6:1

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,170
maybe a week is qualified enough to even

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,020
get to the proposal level we've built

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,500
around 500 our lease it's not a fit I'm

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,560
sorry

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,440
they take the pricing they often filter

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,960
themselves out but then there are some

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,220
that will come back six months later we

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,910
know every page they visit and every

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,040
time they visit that they became a

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,160
better they became the right fit and

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,110
because we we nurtured them we marketed

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,460
to them we did all those things and then

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,100
when they found money they were like oh

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,340
this is a good fit house and then find

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,750
the tools that don't cost that aren't

00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,180
costing you money think you make a

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,710
chef's reason free none of the

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:04,330
inspectors not free none of these tools

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:07,930
are free but they make you money it's an

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:12,850
investment not a an expenditure and take

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:14,410
a look at the tools there were no yeah

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,760
take a look at the tools that you have

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,180
and make sure that they're making you

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:23,770
money so and that is yeah that's how we

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,970
that's how we grew and are continuing to

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:33,720
grow and hopefully were the remainder of

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,720
all time any questions

00:22:49,250 --> 00:23:01,770
absolutely yep all right so the question

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,260
was we have a development side we have a

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:09,300
marketing side do we charge a one

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,070
massive fee and the answer is yes do we

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,520
sometimes split them out the answer is

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,780
yes

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,270
we're going to do the thing that's going

00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,400
to fit the client the best a lot of

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,310
clients are like no I've got I've got

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,380
this X budget to get my website done and

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,300
I've got this is my marketing budget on

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,240
the recurring basis and we want the two

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,970
separate and then there's some that go

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,480
yeah well the one is you know X amount

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,190
of dollars

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,140
you know $15,000 a month or whatever

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:39,290
roll it all in one and we've got an

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,290
annual contract to get that website oh

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:50,130
there's big difference Google Analytics

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:52,890
tells you that people visited where they

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,520
came from how long they were there and

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:59,290
where did they go inspect that says

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,290
let's watch a video of that person

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,750
yeah and when we sew with the

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,670
combination of sharp spring and inspect

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,140
lift we can take your email address your

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,530
IP address tie them together go to

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,420
inspect it and watch Declan walk go

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:19,809
through our website and go page to page

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,809
to page to page and just be totally

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:45,620
we need that happen a lot yeah we'll be

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,309
able to deliver Linux on the website

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,820
give Google Analytics on the website it

00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:54,169
should tell you where that spy camera

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,320
you should be able to go into Google

00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:59,419
Analytics and you say you see the spike

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,279
and you go through the channels and you

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,960
narrow it down say it's you know Tuesday

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,490
we got those spikes with an extra

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,799
hundred visitors than we normally have

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,139
and then you narrow it down to Tuesday

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,789
in Google Analytics and you say it will

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:15,049
break down where that traffic came from

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:19,580
and you know it all came from you know

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:21,309
Facebook in from the day you set up

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,960
Google Analytics it's tracking that data

00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:29,769
it doesn't hear it yep yes sir did you

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,769
find that you had

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,560
or like they'll support another hotel no

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,440
emails terrible if you want if someone's

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,500
email support it's 150 bucks an hour and

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,420
we can help you as much as we can um but

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,700
generally we just direct them over to

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,630
where the anomalistic company is yeah

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,010
yeah and by the way did you say 250

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,540
bucks an hour first to troubleshoot this

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,920
view then you know generally we'll go

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:14,610
get the free support from their email

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:19,770
hospital I guess it depends on which

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:21,750
side the development side they don't we

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,370
don't generally subcontract we'll do

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,440
like a subcontract to hire another thing

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,200
you got 90 days and you're not gonna be

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,120
able hiring also can you pass the drug

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:39,690
test results yes we're definitely not

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:44,370
gonna hire you but yeah it's a process

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,110
literally but no we don't generally

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,820
subcontract a whole lot in terms of

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,970
development most of our subcontractors

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,890
come out of their writers we do so

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,810
captain Eric some writing just because

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,060
they mount that we write when you've got

00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,680
you know dozens of clients in websites

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,390
or something they get ready for we the

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,440
three of us literally can't handle it

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:06,650
and then but if you're a partner you can

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,650
write

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:13,909
we're looking for another market right

00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:16,770
next question about writing so when you

00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:19,799
write on that's life so we've all this

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,720
writing is it is a runoff who you are

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:30,059
are witches as they determine who you

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:32,429
are and then content writers are because

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,590
you buy a few of them down the back of

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:38,779
the class harmony or are they different

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:42,980
writers do they break even once instead

00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:46,620
what you throw the core of who you are

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:52,200
and you suggest that we hire our guitar

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:55,580
by ourselves should you hire some home

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,559
versus internal I think the external

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,140
writers do a great job of explaining its

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,429
we don't know like your customer base

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,200
your customers like our art we've people

00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:10,380
write for us that they don't know

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,090
anything about extra services but you

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,470
know what a lot of some of the mystic

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,570
wonder the website so it's a really big

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,799
thing you know if you have just 19

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,419
people talking about it they talk about

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:24,779
the jargon then that means so you're

the owner to build a website I got them

00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,580

00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,330
how much does a website cost and I go to

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,940
what designers can go okay these are the

00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,910
prices we have another thing is full of

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,560
marketing or website by a guy and that's

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,390
in the middle of a bum that goes what's

00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,370
your process like because that's usually

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,160
the next question isn't it what is this

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,280
all what happens and then we have your

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,070
bottle

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,880
which is they filled out a contact form

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,560
actually said okay I can afford you your

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,340
process is clean and clear I don't know

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,830
what I'm going to be going through

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,960
alright I'm ready to talk to you and

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,820
here's my buddy by the way always ask

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
your budget you don't have that on here

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,490
here

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
your contact form added a drop down give

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,210
it some ranges ask them what their

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,890
budget is because people who tell you

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,180
that they don't have a budget return it

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,000
already it's going to be the longest

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:42,340
damn process of your life it's going to

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
be so long because they have to figure

00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,470
out where they're going to find the

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,020
money when they find out that how much

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,000
it costs to do this so ask them their

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,000
bucket and I want to say that it's

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,260
undetermined you kind of like to skip

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,680
around with you because I'm not really

00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:01,230
sure you're serious someone who's ready

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,230
to buy 120 names then you don't go into

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,810
money you've got so of course at the

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,430
bottom of all ask how much money else

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,290
and then the other content that you're

00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,550
writing is going to be nurturing those

00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,930
leads that those different areas of the

00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,660
phone they came in from the top of the

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:22,360
bottom those other questions that you

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,220
are asked along that process answer

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,060
those write blogs about them and then

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,060
remark that back

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,710
conflict so he mentioned my fantasy

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,570
services would you take in the horizon

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:49,220
services company in the same space which

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:51,260
only okay so no no no no those people we

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,390
get we didn't cut people who asked us to

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,669
do because they see in our portfolio

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,049
that you do this so they go oh now if

00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:00,530
they're we don't have an ongoing project

00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,970
that's one thing but if your of your is

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,919
your marketing yeah because the

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:07,100
marketing or twice as much as the

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,020
website is Ubaldo safe route you know

00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,000
we'll call it twenty grand by the time

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,100
they're three years into their marketing

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,520
it's been hundred thousand dollars are

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,520
going to way more

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:37,430
are you recommending other solutions for

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:41,710
email or us I personally don't care but

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:45,620
no I think we usually that's asking in

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,480
and they usually say go use Google Apps

00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,130
or something like that basically because

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,690
it's got that it's got the cleanest

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,160
integration with some of the software's

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,210
that these are tracking karenina

00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,110
basically and it's super easy to put

00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,110
together just cheap

00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,250
yeah Google lesser or even almost 365

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,960
are so easy to set up it's like yeah

00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:23,700

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:26,890
steal is that plan NGO spinebuster

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,450
reserve I mean yeah if you don't have my

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,120
powers to invest in a property milk

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,790
Senate the announcer mister you're

00:33:47,200 --> 00:34:03,130

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,320
