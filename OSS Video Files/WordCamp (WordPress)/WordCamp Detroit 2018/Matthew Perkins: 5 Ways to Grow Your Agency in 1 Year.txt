Description: 
	This talk is about 5 changes that we made as an agency from the time I arrived to today that have helped us grow our revenues and maintain a healthy income stream. They’re simple changes that help you work with the right clients for your agency. The ultimate goal is to stop chasing bad leads, getting bad clients, and keep consistent revenue coming so you’re not working project to project.

yes creates marketing director and I'm

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,070
going to give you a little bit of

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,500
history I was talking about how they got

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,169
detect I was a music major that's useful

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,000
and using the theater and I've been in

00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,160
sales for I got into sales

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,320
basically because you just have a lie

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:43,640
and the sales department is an extra

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,500
face pills so I got I was when I worked

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,820
in telecommunications so I would isolate

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,650
phone systems and fiber optic networks

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,970
around the state and I got really bored

00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:05,449
and I decided to go to websites it's not

00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:08,300
as boring and I was originally a really

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,880
bad about WordPress for a long time we

00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,909
parted ways built carry studios was

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,100
looking for someone to sell websites and

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,549
it turns out that I'm the only person

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,049
that actually had that as a job so they

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,460
hired me and when I started my job

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:29,120
wasn't supposed to be cold calling

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:34,010
nonprofits to sell website packages

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,090
today that doesn't work so that will not

00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:40,520
be one of the things that's on these

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,310
slides so when I started they were a

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,990
project only they literally did

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,890
everything in products and when project

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,689
the project project and they did about

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,500
300,000 those aren't real numbers your

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:56,670
point seven they it's actually pretty

00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,900
close but they'd about 300,000

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:05,399
career from the steps that we took to

00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,550
the time I walked in we have doubled and

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:13,470
we are planning on doubling again this

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,800
year to our goals here are to reach a

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,239
million dollars in sales and the ways we

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,530
did it are going to be explained here

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:29,010
how many of you are actually agencies

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:31,080
raise your hands please I will chop

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,190
four-letter words if you're offended I'm

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,860
sorry

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,330
just how I talk I want to do not

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,620
agencies and businesses and thinking

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,660
this is going to teach you how to do

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,690
your business better and you can be a

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,180
your same if you're working as a sole

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,190
remember you're a freelancer this little

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,299
YouTube but if you're like I work for

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,769
Compuware please leave and bring us out

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:58,170
some things that you don't want to know

00:02:54,769 --> 00:03:00,630
so the first thing that we have to do

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,530
and this is sound simple because we had

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,600
an oath we work we even know are we a

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,970
development agency that is a designer

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,040
are we assigning agency that's

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,700
development are we marketing what what

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,720
the hell are we

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,920
and also what was the language that we

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,630
wanted to use this is it seems simple we

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,820
should go out we know who we are we know

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,260
the kind of people that work here it's

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,239
actually taking those two years we've

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,010
gone through several iterations of our

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,900
language and when I first started when I

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,760
first came on I said okay well we need

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,049
to create all this content we need to us

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,700
to do this is how we're going to talk

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,970
about it we're gonna use all the

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,650
buzzwords and it was it was a terrible

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,260
flocking term we hated it

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,780
that's just not us we're the tough love

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,000
agency we're going to tell you how it is

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,220
we're in the you know we're

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,720
or not there would be your friend where

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:58,020
they're making money and so we had to

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,520
learn what who we were and we had a

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,980
Creek content around though that

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,720
language and the other thing that we had

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,360
to find was our thresholds never I said

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,660
I walked into that job and I was mostly

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,460
selling website packages and I'm gonna

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,140
say comer and I know a lot of people

00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:20,880
it's going to seem like it's 10 that was

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,530
announced by the website turns out

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,050
nobody want to buy those

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,640
not because $10,000 is a lot of money

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,890
it's because it wasn't a break that

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,270
wasn't what we were companies the

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,700
organizations that we were working with

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,900
they weren't at that threshold but the

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,050
companies that we needed to work with

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,850
were they weren't interested in packages

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,100
way to learn who we learned what our

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,530
thresholds work so no we don't sell

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,560
$10,000 sets never going to come here

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,510
it's generally about 25 grand and then

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,669
you know it's funny you're gonna find

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,530
out any of them you can find out how

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,150
much the website is that our website you

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,100
can come to us you ask a question we're

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,780
gonna give you that answer the other

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,440
threshold we had to figure out what is

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,860
our top tier I give you a little story

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,500
when I came on develop trade I have

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,900
about 90 days to make this whole process

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,880
work the first 60 days I was doing that

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,830
cold calling thing you know it's also

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,660
great content and doing the things and

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,860
say hey guys you know this thing that I

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,050
do for you guys

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,240
you know it will pay us to do this this

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,350
inbound marketing thing that you know

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,030
are getting leads and things of that

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,790
nature it will actually pay us to do

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,990
this know fast fair amount and then and

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:33,180
Eric our owner he was like okay we'll

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,100
sign up for this specific software you

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,150
got 30 days it doesn't work we're gonna

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,050
cut ties

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,400
we're done you go back to the

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,440
interpreter day 21 signed a very large

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,169
contract with a very large statewide

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,479
company we have to learn that top

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,400
threshold they would not a good fit I

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,910
couldn't control them I couldn't manage

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,060
them

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,800
there were to date there was so you have

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,540
to know where your balance is now the

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,430
kingdom's today we've got more employees

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,050
we did a thing who probably a better fit

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,750
but that wasn't our threshold at the

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,169
time can we had to learn very quickly

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:11,010
how to say no and I'm going to say no

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,440
very easy by the end of this the second

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,289
thing we had to do was find a recurring

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,720
revenue source this doesn't have to be a

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,580
huge thing you don't have to go in and

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,690
be like we're going to charge $10,000 a

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,350
month we'll use marketing and blah blah

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,150
blah

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,680
no you can how many of you use an

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,020
outside hosting company please tell me

you don't post in your house right

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,380
everyone uses an outside posting company

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,430
how many of you are charging your

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:42,000
clients to post their website a monthly

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,270
recurring fee sometimes you have

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,120
maintenance building to that yeah if you

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,950
don't have me when I walked in they said

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,289
no I don't like 100's you hosting

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,180
they're like well we just we're like one

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,610
of them signup horrible get all the

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,020
stuff set up on you know liquid web or

00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,700
whatever you know on those servers that

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,949
we did server advisor we want working

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,110
but we don't charge Manila

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,720
well there's a lot of great partners

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,240
that are downstairs that can create a

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,039
structure for you to make money off of

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,509
the hosting and all of the maintenance

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,190
maintenance doesn't take that long

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,930
you built the website well it's not

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,789
going to take that much you can charge

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,300
people and now you have a monthly to

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:25,479
give up just a small revenue stream that

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,889
you can draw on because what I'm going

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:32,979
to try to work everyone through is you

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,570
can't scale your company if you don't

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:37,090
have a scalable amount of money coming

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,430
in every month if you're going from

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,199
project to project you may have a banner

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,240
first quarter you know oh my god I got

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,780
higher tune got a higher to developers

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,669
again to all this stuff except the next

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,210
quarter it takes a dip and that was

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:55,599
literally the heaven flow that that

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,389
artwork on our company had every single

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,449
year was they did this all year long

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:04,750
family and and they've great years they

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:07,150
had big time years but they didn't have

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,210
monthly recurring revenues allows to

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,599
make an upward trajectory less than 10%

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:17,349
of our monthly revenues and 2015 we're

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,770
coming for month our 10% of our revenues

00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:23,020
every month were monthly revenues by

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,849
2017 is about it was about half and

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,500
that's kind of the threshold that we

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,510
want to thank even I want people about

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,159
half of our of the money that's coming

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:36,159
in is coming from existing client bases

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,490
and the thing that it did or our owners

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,669
he is to sleep now it's to rest

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,850
he knows his bills are paid is you know

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,040
rent is paid the lights are on all

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,660
these are taken care of doesn't it worry

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,720
about payroll these things are done

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,090
they're not and they don't then I'm

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,470
going anywhere those people are locked

00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,910
into agreements they're locked into

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,800
contracts so that we can scale and to

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,140
kind of give you an example we when I

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,940
started with about one and a half whole

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,310
town employees maybe two whole time

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,790
employees and a couple of contractors we

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,410
have we just signed a new lease to move

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,690
out of town because they can't find

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,550
space to think about because we have six

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,950
seven full time employees ever going on

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,050
and we're hydrated by the way if

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,060
anyone's in marketing you come see me

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,300
afterward we're looking for another

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:33,760
marketer but I'm gonna nother medium so

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:36,600
I can see the vacation so the steps to

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,400
doing it or to create content so right

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,060
don't like writing I'm sorry this is not

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,100
good talk for you you need to write we

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,470
create and when we do an inbound

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,910
campaign we generally tell people you

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,910
shouldn't be creating at least two or

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,120
three pieces of content every single day

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm sorry

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,420
we do have one piece of content - two

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,600
pieces of chocolate every single day

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,760
internally we literally utter there's

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,190
somebody writing every single day

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,780
and the S is good for SEO the second

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,730
thing that is that we can use it more

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,590
because we're strategic cannot be

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,090
writing as we can reuse that content to

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,910
nurture our deeds to work them down the

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,530
sales funnel to email triple campaigns

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,580
and I'm sure some of you this room get

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,150
all the time we get to use that that

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,980
content to continue to nurture leads and

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,630
they may be bad leads but we don't have

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,640
to worry about it as an homage to taking

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:42,640
care of it and we get to be that change

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,900
that we see we want to tell people hey

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,610
you you know you should be doing this

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,800
you should be paying us to do this but

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,860
we have to be the first one to do it we

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,090
have to show people that that that this

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,660
is what you should be doing this is how

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,550
it works

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,580
and we have the case studies including

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,150
ourselves that say yeah this works

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,380
because traffic went up 40 percent and

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,050
our leads went from like about two

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:11,350
important on tech once a month to we get

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,780
about six leads a week now not all of

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,530
them are qualified and in the next steps

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,240
said we're going to figure out how we

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,850
get how do we filter those people out

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,950
those leads are coming from vertical

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,500
shaded content so we've all their

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,900
content you take the best of it you put

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:33,160
it behind a pay wall and that pay wall

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,250
is give me your who you are tell me who

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,140
you are

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,940
and we will sell you all the data you

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,810
want on can anyone tell me what the

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,970
first

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,690
never asks you when they want to talk

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:49,240
about building the website anybody how

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,540
much does it cost how many of you are

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,070
afraid to tell someone's website stuff

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,410
why do you know how much your

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,480
competitors to charge for a website so

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,570
they know how much you charge right so

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,940
okay and if they're below the threshold

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,770
you tell them hey this website cost this

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,480
month and then below the threshold you

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,400
want to deal with you can have email

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,600
marketing do the thing because if

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,980
they're really passionate about what

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,690
they want and they're like man I can

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,520
only four or five or five thousand two

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,170
thousand thousand dollars but it cost

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,580
for you a thousand you know twice that

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,640
if they really want to work with you

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,290
they really want to go find the money if

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,150
they're passionate about their business

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,580
and if this is serious or that they're

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,680
gonna find the money so if you continue

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,800
to nurture them through automations you

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,610
know workflows things of that nature you

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,700
personally as the business owner don't

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,440
have to do jack just let it go and if

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,770
they're happy if they won't you have

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,660
they're gonna come back which is

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,960
lausanne about remarketing to them and

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,480
there's two ways to remarket and at

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,250
least for me into one is the email

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,160
marketing that i'm talking about the

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,210
second thing is if any of you are not

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,420
using Google AdWords remarketing for

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,590
your business you should do that now

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:10,840
and I'm gonna let you in on a secret

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:15,000
it's super damn cheap really cheap we've

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:19,720
set a budget of about $2 a day never max

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,690
our AdWords costs can be called thousand

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,450
dollars monthly for search ads our

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,680
remarketing ads bus is virtually nothing

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,900
because the whole point is that it's a

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,870
brand it's remarketing it's a brand cup

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,490
reinforcer if you will it every time you

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,800
go to another website you see that

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,870
filtering that you and I didn't pull all

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,490
the time to complain we do and please

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,210
lay off I can't go to a website well

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:54,910
senior student greeting pads no that

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:58,240
means I'm in tough and you use all of

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,800
this this information and you can endure

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,270
to those leads is like I said they

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,750
really really really want what you've

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,340
got

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,400
they're gonna find a way to get the

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,200
money to do it and we've learnt to talk

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,460
about automation and I'm gonna dig into

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:16,530
that a little bit deeper down the road

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:19,510
oh if the tools that make you money

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:24,430
WordPress is fantastic it's for the most

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,420
part free but find some tools that are

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,760
going to make you money

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,050
find a good hosting partner that's that

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,210
first step finding that first residual

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,550
you know amount of money that you can

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,230
help them okay so it sounds bad as I

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,830
thought 100 bucks mom Plus that you

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,660
build all the websites of them in a year

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,190
that's 1200 dollars looks for very you

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,490
know the next year's four dollars a

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,410
month

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,840
this is recurring revenue that you can

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,020
use to

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,730
pay for a part-time developer to do your

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,830
part of the maintenance and you're still

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,510
thinking that means profit profit is

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,430
good and then fun good marketing tools

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,160
because I don't know I'm kind of skipped

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,100
over the point by the way SEO PPC

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,500
inbound marketing this is not that hard

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,550
I literally taught myself my job by

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,860
watching YouTube video it took a little

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,480
while spent a lot of time doing it this

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,550
isn't rocket science if you can do build

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,180
and develop website you can do SEO it's

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:26,250
just not that hard and the beautiful

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,130
part of WordPress is that it gives you

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,670
so many great tools already they kind of

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,920
make tin ghost being one of them and not

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,320
because they're sponsored but seriously

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,370
love them because their sponsor they're

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,589
it's four on page SEO it's super it's

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,900
free and you get to learn some of those

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:49,350
you smell the character that you should

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,330
okay order my keywords one it's they

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,710
give it to you if you come from the

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,660
custom side like I do they don't have

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,280
those tools you just got to know the

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,560
information and that's where I think a

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,630
lot of the people got this idea that

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,140
search engine optimization is rocket

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,510
science

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,190
now I'm gonna tell every client I'm glad

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,930
there's no businesses in here that it

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,930
really is rocket science and do really

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,610
are work that was

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:15,160
do this but it's not and any if you're a

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,410
single I just do this by myself it

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,380
builds websites for small businesses and

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,210
if you can if you can build that website

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,120
you can optimize it and help them in the

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,760
market and what are some of the tools

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,770
that we use number ones

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,440
the reason I'm going to say expect it's

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,270
a great tool as it makes money again

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,880
it's a business even here they have a

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:40,029
model that allows us to charge more than

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,220
what we pay for it so for a small

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,480
business who's just getting started you

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,570

five minutes ten licenses and it's $79 a

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:53,529
month this is this lookup this weapon is

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,550
a it's screen captures every visitor so

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,720
you need to see how people are

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,440
interacting with your website it does

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,760
eat mapping does click mapping these are

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,709
these are not only powerful tools for

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,050
your user experience and your marketing

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:07,120

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,670
to take into a sales meeting and go look

proposals give you all this information

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:22,449

money off of everybody else that profit

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,770
is necessary because the seven hundred

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,730
and ninety dollars a month or whatever

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,640
is you know part of a payroll for

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,020
another concept forever

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,910
now we can scale them take on more

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,970
clients we can make more money

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,140

00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:58,210
websites and making an ism as optimized

00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:01,899
for search engines you know possible

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,309
they're constantly checking website data

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,220
they're doing all the things they're

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:08,230
giving all these insights and the last

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,809
one is Sharpsburg now this is actually a

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,700
tool that kind of took this to the next

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,820
level and this is the thing that I had

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,169
30 days to prove that this works and

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,159
worse I'm here talking to you now so

00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,960
obviously it did and gives it agency I

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,350
don't know if you're familiar with tough

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,470
spot okay it's big buzzword they charge

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,139
a ton of money

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:35,019
Jeffrey's competitor most populous basis

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:37,570
is is that we are four agencies our

00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:40,360
pricing model is four agencies we want

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,399
to help agencies grow it's pretty much

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,899
the same functionality it's Marketo part

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:48,970
a tough spot but a tenth of the cost and

00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:54,370
they sell you your chart which you want

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:56,590
we don't care so you can and anyone who

00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,879
wants a demo bonus if you're interested

00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,500
in something like this you come see me

00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:02,860
afterward and I will get you a demo from

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,049
shark spring and you know I'll give the

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,279
referral and send it off to one more to

00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,309
our comp reps and they'll give you a

00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,320
demo of the software I hope you

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:14,440
understand the pricing model I won't

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,820
really go and really go into that but

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,120
it's an incredibly aggressive pricing

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,820
model to help agencies because once you

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,279
for us once we've locked our clients

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,049
into we give them so much data they know

00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,789
who visits you know when they visit

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,710
whatever page they visit they know all

00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:30,119
this information

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,899
Anna's got marketing automation tools

00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,070
email tools and one of more important

00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:36,659
things for business owners

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,570
it's where did my large marketing

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,220
dollars get spent marketing attribution

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,860
and this tool gave us marketing

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,450
attribution that says you know are you

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,450
familiar with John Wonka he was a it was

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,570
a good magnate in retail and then the

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,860
turn of the century he said half my

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,009
Evernote advertising dollars are wasted

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,259
problems I don't know which app what

00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:02,940
some of these tools that are going to

00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,740
help you as a business and then also

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,690
help you grow as a business because you

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,399
can resell this to other people is that

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,070
you get to tell them this is where your

00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:14,549
marketing dollars work and oh by the way

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,080
if they're welcome organic please guess

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,789
it was good we're look at what we did

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,840
breathe you should stay working with us

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:26,580
and pay us more money so kind of wrap

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,279
things up in conclusion if you don't

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,590
know who you are then how can your

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,360
customers ever know who you are

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,470
and how are you going to know how are

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,379
they gonna know that they're a good fit

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,679
for you remove them and if you're living

00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:43,440
project project how can you grow safely

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,059
that's it's worthy heart anyone ask

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,009
anybody who's been doing this for you

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:49,100
know six eight ten years growing

00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:52,499
organically is very very difficult

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,679
without some sort of safety mechanism in

00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:59,279
the terms of monthly recurring relatives

00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:02,399
and but I can't stress this enough or

00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:06,929
create content create content it's got

00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:07,600
the so much value and then answer the

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:10,060
question

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,280
you have and filter out those that are

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:17,710
qualified not everybody's a good fit or

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:20,890
build great studios we know of those 6:1

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,170
maybe a week is qualified enough to even

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,020
get to the proposal level we've built

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,500
around 500 our lease it's not a fit I'm

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,560
sorry

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,440
they take the pricing they often filter

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,960
themselves out but then there are some

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,220
that will come back six months later we

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,910
know every page they visit and every

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,040
time they visit that they became a

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,160
better they became the right fit and

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,110
because we we nurtured them we marketed

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,460
to them we did all those things and then

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,100
when they found money they were like oh

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,340
this is a good fit house and then find

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,750
the tools that don't cost that aren't

00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,180
costing you money think you make a

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,710
chef's reason free none of the

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:04,330
inspectors not free none of these tools

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:07,930
are free but they make you money it's an

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:12,850
investment not a an expenditure and take

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:14,410
a look at the tools there were no yeah

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,760
take a look at the tools that you have

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,180
and make sure that they're making you

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:23,770
money so and that is yeah that's how we

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,970
that's how we grew and are continuing to

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:33,720
grow and hopefully were the remainder of

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,720
all time any questions

00:22:49,250 --> 00:23:01,770
absolutely yep all right so the question

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,260
was we have a development side we have a

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:09,300
marketing side do we charge a one

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,070
massive fee and the answer is yes do we

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,520
sometimes split them out the answer is

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,780
yes

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,270
we're going to do the thing that's going

00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,400
to fit the client the best a lot of

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,310
clients are like no I've got I've got

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,380
this X budget to get my website done and

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,300
I've got this is my marketing budget on

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,240
the recurring basis and we want the two

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,970
separate and then there's some that go

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,480
yeah well the one is you know X amount

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,190
of dollars

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,140
you know $15,000 a month or whatever

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:39,290
roll it all in one and we've got an

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,290
annual contract to get that website oh

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:50,130
there's big difference Google Analytics

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:52,890
tells you that people visited where they

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,520
came from how long they were there and

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:59,290
where did they go inspect that says

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,290
let's watch a video of that person

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,750
yeah and when we sew with the

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,670
combination of sharp spring and inspect

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,140
lift we can take your email address your

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,530
IP address tie them together go to

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,420
inspect it and watch Declan walk go

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:19,809
through our website and go page to page

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,809
to page to page and just be totally

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:45,620
we need that happen a lot yeah we'll be

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,309
able to deliver Linux on the website

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,820
give Google Analytics on the website it

00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:54,169
should tell you where that spy camera

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,320
you should be able to go into Google

00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:59,419
Analytics and you say you see the spike

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,279
and you go through the channels and you

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,960
narrow it down say it's you know Tuesday

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,490
we got those spikes with an extra

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,799
hundred visitors than we normally have

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,139
and then you narrow it down to Tuesday

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,789
in Google Analytics and you say it will

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:15,049
break down where that traffic came from

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:19,580
and you know it all came from you know

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:21,309
Facebook in from the day you set up

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,960
Google Analytics it's tracking that data

00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:29,769
it doesn't hear it yep yes sir did you

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,769
find that you had

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,560
or like they'll support another hotel no

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,440
emails terrible if you want if someone's

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,500
email support it's 150 bucks an hour and

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,420
we can help you as much as we can um but

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,700
generally we just direct them over to

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,630
where the anomalistic company is yeah

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,010
yeah and by the way did you say 250

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,540
bucks an hour first to troubleshoot this

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,920
view then you know generally we'll go

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:14,610
get the free support from their email

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:19,770
hospital I guess it depends on which

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:21,750
side the development side they don't we

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,370
don't generally subcontract we'll do

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,440
like a subcontract to hire another thing

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,200
you got 90 days and you're not gonna be

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,120
able hiring also can you pass the drug

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:39,690
test results yes we're definitely not

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:44,370
gonna hire you but yeah it's a process

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,110
literally but no we don't generally

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,820
subcontract a whole lot in terms of

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,970
development most of our subcontractors

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,890
come out of their writers we do so

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,810
captain Eric some writing just because

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,060
they mount that we write when you've got

00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,680
you know dozens of clients in websites

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,390
or something they get ready for we the

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,440
three of us literally can't handle it

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:06,650
and then but if you're a partner you can

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,650
write

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:13,909
we're looking for another market right

00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:16,770
next question about writing so when you

00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:19,799
write on that's life so we've all this

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,720
writing is it is a runoff who you are

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:30,059
are witches as they determine who you

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:32,429
are and then content writers are because

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,590
you buy a few of them down the back of

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:38,779
the class harmony or are they different

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:42,980
writers do they break even once instead

00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:46,620
what you throw the core of who you are

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:52,200
and you suggest that we hire our guitar

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:55,580
by ourselves should you hire some home

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,559
versus internal I think the external

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,140
writers do a great job of explaining its

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,429
we don't know like your customer base

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,200
your customers like our art we've people

00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:10,380
write for us that they don't know

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,090
anything about extra services but you

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,470
know what a lot of some of the mystic

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,570
wonder the website so it's a really big

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,799
thing you know if you have just 19

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,419
people talking about it they talk about

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:24,779
the jargon then that means so you're

the owner to build a website I got them

00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,580

00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,330
how much does a website cost and I go to

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,940
what designers can go okay these are the

00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,910
prices we have another thing is full of

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,560
marketing or website by a guy and that's

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,390
in the middle of a bum that goes what's

00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,370
your process like because that's usually

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,160
the next question isn't it what is this

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,280
all what happens and then we have your

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,070
bottle

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,880
which is they filled out a contact form

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,560
actually said okay I can afford you your

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,340
process is clean and clear I don't know

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,830
what I'm going to be going through

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,960
alright I'm ready to talk to you and

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,820
here's my buddy by the way always ask

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
your budget you don't have that on here

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,490
here

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
your contact form added a drop down give

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,210
it some ranges ask them what their

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,890
budget is because people who tell you

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,180
that they don't have a budget return it

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,000
already it's going to be the longest

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:42,340
damn process of your life it's going to

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
be so long because they have to figure

00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,470
out where they're going to find the

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,020
money when they find out that how much

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,000
it costs to do this so ask them their

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,000
bucket and I want to say that it's

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,260
undetermined you kind of like to skip

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,680
around with you because I'm not really

00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:01,230
sure you're serious someone who's ready

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,230
to buy 120 names then you don't go into

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,810
money you've got so of course at the

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,430
bottom of all ask how much money else

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,290
and then the other content that you're

00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,550
writing is going to be nurturing those

00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,930
leads that those different areas of the

00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,660
phone they came in from the top of the

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:22,360
bottom those other questions that you

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,220
are asked along that process answer

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,060
those write blogs about them and then

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,060
remark that back

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,710
conflict so he mentioned my fantasy

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,570
services would you take in the horizon

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:49,220
services company in the same space which

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:51,260
only okay so no no no no those people we

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,390
get we didn't cut people who asked us to

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,669
do because they see in our portfolio

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,049
that you do this so they go oh now if

00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:00,530
they're we don't have an ongoing project

00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,970
that's one thing but if your of your is

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,919
your marketing yeah because the

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:07,100
marketing or twice as much as the

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,020
website is Ubaldo safe route you know

00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,000
we'll call it twenty grand by the time

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,100
they're three years into their marketing

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,520
it's been hundred thousand dollars are

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,520
going to way more

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:37,430
are you recommending other solutions for

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:41,710
email or us I personally don't care but

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:45,620
no I think we usually that's asking in

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,480
and they usually say go use Google Apps

00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,130
or something like that basically because

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,690
it's got that it's got the cleanest

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,160
integration with some of the software's

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,210
that these are tracking karenina

00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,110
basically and it's super easy to put

00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,110
together just cheap

00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,250
yeah Google lesser or even almost 365

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,960
are so easy to set up it's like yeah

00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:23,700

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:26,890
steal is that plan NGO spinebuster

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,450
reserve I mean yeah if you don't have my

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,120
powers to invest in a property milk

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,790
Senate the announcer mister you're

00:33:47,200 --> 00:34:03,130

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,320
