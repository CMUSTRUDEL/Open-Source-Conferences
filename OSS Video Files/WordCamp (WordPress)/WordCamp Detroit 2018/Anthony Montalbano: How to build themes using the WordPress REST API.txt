Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	There so much power behind the WordPress REST API. This session will guide you through building a mini theme using the WordPress REST API. Learn how the REST API can be used not just in a theme, but for a mobile app, a plugin, a Gutenberg block, and beyond!

excited yeah yes yes good all right

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:21,800
so I'm excited to do this I really like

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,089
a feature where we restaurants my part

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,710
of the feature that I like something

00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:30,099
inside of this how many in this room

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,099
right of developers alrighty good at all

00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:39,440
so there's a hiss presentation at

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:42,830
alliances give a good foundation guy a

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:49,220
general and kind of roam into talking

00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:51,980
about building stuff no this is me I

00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,750
have a company has long distance from

00:00:51,980 --> 00:01:01,060
here am pretty sure eyes were closer to

00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,060
buh-buh-bah from here we go a lot of

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,880
about 7% of our projects over the

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:15,619
Pressman base and everything that we

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:18,280
build with our goal it's all about

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:21,409
writing the software building experience

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,310
doing this for a long time now I'll be

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:30,229
the first time personally played with

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:35,840
that piece be files 2007 a long time I

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:41,539
became very press first what we were

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,889
expecting alright so here's what we're

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,950
gonna do we're gonna do a little

00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:49,130
one-on-one not writing guys not your

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,859
money I draw I make sure we're all on

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,509
the same page here that way it makes a

00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,459
lot easier to kind of using oxidation

00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,049
and we'll do a little intro into the

00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:58,999
word president think rusty yeah but that

00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,009
looks like we'll create a little mini

00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:03,799
feed you're learning to talk a little

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,709
but endless WordPress and then extending

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,899
this to be on so it's a pretty

00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,610
aggressive schedule a lot that I want to

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,440
cover in this short for your time but

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,140
hopefully this goes well

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,790
okay so let's get down the fundamentals

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:25,300
of what we're here to talk about what is

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:27,160
the EPI and so again some of this might

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,540
be a refresher but again it's all about

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,580
some feature we have them data and we

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,380
want to just share it right that's kind

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,600
of that's fundamental with you guys my

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,260
dad so for this example we have close

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,220
but all they pull there's an excerpt we

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,980
want to share it with people

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,360
so what to be took me to do we build a

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,190
website to share the information with

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,130
people so we display the information to

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,660
people on a website but what if you want

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,640
to display that information and other

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,960
devices or you want the information to

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,070
be accessible to multiple devices the

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,350
way is it should be clear and others

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,030
will need yeah so that's what we're here

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,920
to talk about this how you facilitate

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,710
that so that I think of an API to

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,280
basically have a proxy to the data to be

00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,580
to be viewed in different areas so

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,470
that's kind of assistance so how does

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,690
that look it's obviously not pretty like

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,960
a website it's more programmatic and

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,270
it's this is a JSON representation I'm

00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,460
just talking about today but what this

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,290
allows is to do is now write software on

00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,750
top of other platforms and access the

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:35,880
data and show other places so that's you

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:38,200
know Ed's or let me guys and countries

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:44,350
there's lots of services out there that

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:46,180
have example okay so what is it restful

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,730
so we're talking about WordPress recipe

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,900
yeah

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,340
those most important to just have a good

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,470
understanding of what a restful means

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,320
and someone this is kind of broken down

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,600
about officials representational state

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,210
transfer now you're going to have a four

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,290
kind of making constant lettuces we're

00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,300
going to go through each one of these

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,390
just so we have a good foundation so

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,410
let's look at this what this looks like

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,570
in terms of an age of computer club so

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,920
and even guys it's basically a bunch of

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,950
a series of URLs a recipe guy and when

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,850
you get those who are ELLs it returns

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,830
data back

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,590
so we have a few things that we have to

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,620
break down into what this ECP request

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,930
looks like so we have the URL itself we

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,180
have the methods - typically when you

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,580
use your browser and you type URL in

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,670
you're actually using the get method

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,100
that's the realm of Gus and Evi it you

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,010
actually correctly guy we have more than

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,020
just to get method to get data we'll

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,560
talk more about that and then we have

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,520
header meta that you'll also be able to

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,690
that and then you also have the body and

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
so we're gonna walk through this a

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,340
little more so we all have understanding

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,370
something the second part to the

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,710
breastbone drive is resource based so

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,480
what this means is the the URLs

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,580
whether you're generated is typically

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,800
based off of options so if you think of

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,660
a custom post type as a resource that's

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,950
kind of the same kind of concept here as

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,920
I mentioned before a little above the

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,770
HTTP requests here's an example of how

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,770
you we basically get and manipulate data

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,270
already attacks to get the catorces you

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,710
can get a collection of posts you can

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,830
get a post last one which because a

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,710
single post you can post to create use

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,530
the post method to create a post and

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,390
those posted posts and then there many

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,340
other the button delete which helps you

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,750
update to delete those things so these

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,450
are the different methods that you're

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,980
using and as we get into this a little

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,350
more you'll see how this all plays into

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:54,460
the WordPress REST API because all of

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:57,910
these things are composite the next part

00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,970
is stainless so in a restful api every

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,270
time we make a call the authentication

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,480
happens within the cost of every call is

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,620
self-contained meaning that the way it

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,700
typically works with authentication is

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,590
authorization happens first

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,050
somewhere like a login and then you have

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,780
a token that you just basically pass

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,780
back and forth with the API so that you

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,920
can basically get the data or having

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,180
permissions to do those type of things

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,070
so this is also done with WordPress as

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,300
well where there's a token

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,270
and we're gonna cover it a little more

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,520
but this kind of mentals here and then

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,920
we also have a representation which

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,490
basically says the objects that are

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,620
returned is in a format that is a great

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,090
economist at the json format xml it's

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,400
also common

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:53,410
but today we're focusing on she sent any

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,890
questions i was like the foundation all

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,460
dressed up are you next up yes good so

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,330
far

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,360
okay let's jump into the WordPress REST

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,590
API and how this all come together so

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,960
since we're across four seven the

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,840
radical WordPress REST API it's been

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,550
available if you actually just pull up

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,140
in your browser and whatever that your

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:19,470
wordpress site is and technically not

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:22,570
w/e that json you'll be able to see

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,420
basically the court calls within your

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:29,620
request be compressed API so apparently

00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,570
it's there for you to be beautiful so as

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,970
an example if you can see here if you

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,370
add a little more to the URL I can get

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,320
the collection of posts so this is you

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,850
know I started really fundamental here I

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,710
can go to like obviously you take one

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,110
you can assume the same current all the

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,550
other cities that are in the site almost

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,460
which worked out a little bit into them

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,960
but so here's the posts so if you can

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,500
see at the top URL a little bit

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,140
different

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,420
I have version and then I also have

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,180
slash posts and when I make that call

00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,090
it's going to return an array of JSON

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,280
objects and you top it is all the data

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:14,260
related to each post so that way you can

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:15,970
use it soon dinner so there you go

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,690
there's all examples here where I could

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:22,570
not get posts individual posts or a bid

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,510
in a specific category so this is really

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:31,060
nice because not only can you get all of

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:33,750
those category your tags and all their

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,010
not be patient totally accepted a

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,620
relatively other day it doesn't pretty

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,950
good job with seeing all the

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:47,400
possibilities you can do these for costs

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:49,900
okay so that's kind of a little bit of a

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,510
warehouse rusty guy so let's talk about

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,630
building a minute an interview I realize

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,880
oh my god I have an example I built up I

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,240
took the 2017 theme this is what I want

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,970
to do is maybe II kind of like the front

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,790
page of 2017 deep restful so that way

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,820
our even about WordPress REST API so

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:12,820
that way the posts are loading as

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,710
opposed to being done within PHP so I

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,160
think the the biggest difference here is

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,140
to keep in mind is when you have you're

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,540
building something with a progressive

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,920
guy and you're building anything

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,710
specifically by the involved a theme is

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,500
the HP files right and you're using PHP

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,990
tags to display together which means

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,450
that the server on the back end is

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,270
Brendan to variables for you and then

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:43,390
sending all the HTML to the browser to

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:47,350
load the content right the difference

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,940
now is that information it doesn't exist

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,880
on the front end it's being requested

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,830
individually through the API and then we

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,630
have to take the data bring it into the

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,700
browser

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,980
generate instead of HTML that we need to

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,190
generate and then insert it into the DOM

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,080
and hangs behind of data so that's how a

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,300
lot of websites work today which is like

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,100
the browser is not as refreshing it's

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,220
kind of silly doing a pull and push of

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,680
data using the browser and then we

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,780
render HTML front so that's essentially

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,310
what we're going to create today to mini

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,310
theme that does exactly that

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,880
[Music]

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,830
so

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:59,430
yes yes I will make all these slides

00:10:49,710 --> 00:11:00,180
available basically so this looks very

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,420
familiar

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,910
this is year 2017 so mister you guys

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:12,170
I've seen this many times before and

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,170
what we can see here's an example

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,290
prepped ahead and I thought I was

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,290
already

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,900
so let's just walk through this a little

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:45,350
bit we can always do the technicals it I

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:49,310
don't know why in that word I swear I

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,140
should have every ability all right so

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,870
as an example of the way I just showed

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,340
you the last a great speech as well and

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,840
we have those folks that are loaded

00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,480
there this is what we typically see

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,030
of course it's render to an end user and

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,390
you just see we're gonna render a little

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,270
bit differently using that so to do this

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,000
let's talk about what you have to do

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,800
within a feat not going to go through

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,880
how to create a beam I have the

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,830
assumption that you have a little bit

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,690
understanding how things are created but

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,450
let's talk about how to add into your

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,350
beam the dependencies that need to do

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,480
and the integration so that you can okay

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,530
so the first thing that we need to do is

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,589
we have to add some JavaScript

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:34,220
dependencies so this is an abundance PHP

00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:37,130
file of your theme which most all peeps

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,610
how and so what we're doing here is

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,430
we're using the dopey few scripts action

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,320
here and we're in viewing the weg nach

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,780
so this is inherently in WordPress

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,870
but it's not inherently and cute so you

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:53,690
have to that that by doing that we mean

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,920
the leaf are going to have so this is my

00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:00,320
browser you can see I have wapi setting

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,990
so if I make that call my console and

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,880
Neely have enormous of droop and

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,520
aversion which helps me get a little

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,810
information I'm going to eat for my axe

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,670
over my development Appiah so that's the

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,520
personality but in the second thing I'm

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,650
just alluding here is essentially a

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,720
JavaScript file this javascript file is

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,390
going to be making the requests to eat

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,589
guy to basically retrieve information so

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:29,030
those are the two things that we're

00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:33,320
adding to our functions PHP to do the

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:36,950
duration all right so the next thing we

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,740
need to do is essentially just make a

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,640
x2 the API to retrieve information so

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,210
you can do this

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,490
this is using jQuery AJAX call so you

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,910
can see I know you guys liked about

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:54,180
fruit so that is basically taken from

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,970
that variable so by adding that script

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,610
to your being uniquely have it of l2 so

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,610
now I can use it in my JavaScript if you

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,510
don't do that WPIX script you cannot do

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,310
that and obviously the other thing we're

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,830
doing is we're adding a heavy so you can

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:14,220
see and they'll be forced and then set

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,600
requested her and it's a X W peanuts and

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,940
then I'm guessing the dirty you guys

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,900
think not the reason why I would do this

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:25,560
is this is your authentication in the

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,720
instance that you want these sites to be

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,160
able to do something such as modify a

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,370
post maybe you want to have the ability

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,550
to on the front end and have the user

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,740
modify some of the text post you can do

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,420
that by using the nonce the nonce is

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,170
come out basically help with the

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,750
authentication and what that also does

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,730
is it's it's not have users information

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,000
specifically but what does in the

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,070
backend and is used as determine who the

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,960
user is whether a lot of user a not like

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,480
that user and whether they out the

00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,600
permissions to do so and we'll get a

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,450
little into that so definitely I called

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,840
s from jQuery this is pretty

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,840
straightforward

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,070
the nice thing is is WordPress actually

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,730
provides a JavaScript library they have

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,190
a backbone

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,840
yes client library built-in so this

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,000
actually makes it even easier to

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,050
integrate or work with the WordPress

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,180
recipe yeah

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,370
so they provide a few many things so we

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,990
have models and collections of models

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,170
like a post to collection is a pleasure

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:31,110
no mods so that's the two things that we

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:35,070
have so now taking that example that we

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,480
have before jQuery we can simplify our

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,610
JavaScript and write something as simple

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,850
as this so you can see I outpost

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:45,330
collections people's the WPE guy

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,980
that plus is not and then Keppel T posts

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,650
and by doing that

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,290
this object that economical fetch the

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:55,310
collection and so the best thing you can

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:58,080
also see them you carries I am providing

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,910
category 7 so I want just returned to me

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,310
all the folks that are in kind of great

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,680
stepping so this makes a lot easier you

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,660
can do just the two lines of code and it

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,490
handles the Muppets feature for you as

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,290
well so you don't have to think about

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,540
that you type other Asian community

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,760
Heather mountainous is all mine library

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,690
and you can also see this design example

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,880
like do the bottles close to provide the

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:36,860
ID and that returns that JSON object

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:36,860
back to me to use oh yes I almost like

00:16:49,190 --> 00:17:07,380
if you do that but anyways I will get

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,870
help this and then I'll share with help

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:15,480
you I'll basically just a cold means you

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:17,850
guys I'm happily all right so does it

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,959
expand him on this one now if I haven't

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:24,660
be it clear where we do these type of

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,520
things is in that from a tjs file was

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,000
just that's what I have any Paula file

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,800
is it not filled half of all that so if

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,930
you remember when we use the to

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,730
JavaScript bottles one of them is from

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:40,500
page so what we have now is a little bit

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,060
of JavaScript and so you can see what

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,160
we're doing here is we have a suppose

00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,380
collection which we're getting and we're

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,810
fetching them and then we're basically

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,420
then which is kind of the open-ended let

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:55,010
me do next so that was kind of comedy

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,970
here I don't know you guys familiar with

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:01,880
javascript promises much of it so the

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,970
nice thing is is this is you can

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,160
basically adult uses JavaScript promises

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,929
which makes this a lot easier if you're

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,210
doing a lot of things that you want to

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:17,929
do easier tensely which is nice

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,610
okay so what we need to do now is we

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,100
have this slush the price we got this

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,750
javascript this JSON objects and we need

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,110
to display on the front end and how do

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,299
we do that so I'm using a small

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:41,270
JavaScript library called summer gave us

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:42,679
to do so but what we see here is so that

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,980
piece of code based on the previous

00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,740
screen

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,390
it has a very bottom now so it's the

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,070
same stuff and then I just have this

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,679
function up above which I call render

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,330
constants and what I'm doing now is into

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,730
them that was come to before

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,130
I'm calling my function passing those

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,400
models of post lugnut models which is

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:04,850
that array of posts happy in my function

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,690
elbow and then looping through each one

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:12,140
to generate HTML and still I said I'm

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,240
using JSP a simple function where

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,360
everyone has the components of tokens in

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,740
and it generates HTML the bus's words of

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,200
HTML so in this example we have a

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,299
template of each single and so this is

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,929
very similar to the HTML that you're

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:33,320
gonna see in a being file with its

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:35,419
actions tokenize so you can see in here

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,460
I didn't organize everything I just

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,620
organized a handful for the particular

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,200
channel as you can see I'm at like you

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,200
know dollar X brackets permalink I'm

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,809
gonna post titled votes excerpt D so I

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,490
have a few different ones in here so it

00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,020
sounds when this number just library

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,450
does is when it moves through it takes

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,400
this piece of HTML and injects the

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,290
tokens into the barrel of the values and

00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,630
each one of those and then takes that

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:04,140
HTML that's what's doing short

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,300
so we knew all those things you

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,720
immediately have those posts showing

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,010
right up you can see that there is you

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,710
have their class with everything so

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:17,700
guarantee it will just style through

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,980
review and run from there so that's how

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,600
you load those so the next thing that we

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,120
can do is actually add a little bit more

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,340
accent your actions to this and what we

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,900
do is you can add essentially an event

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,720
right here I'm using click so when you

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,240
look on the dock more host objects we

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,040
want to load more posts I'm so it's

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,910
relatively straightforward the cool

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,790
thing about the request API client

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:48,090
javascript javascript libraries are it

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:51,530
gives the ability to just call it down

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:54,450
more and it loads more posts so you can

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,820
paginate this as a BB 25 of

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,910
five-foot-ten you can do that when you

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,690
make your first call I'm going to do

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:06,120
within the more parameters and look up

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,790
my brief occupation but what's really

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,880
nice now I can keep this really clean I

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,040
know I have a disability which is is a

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,950
other piece of code I wrote so that we

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,360
can show like an animated gif that page

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,650
is loading modest retrieving the

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,960
information from the server and flung it

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,640
back which is waiting so I have it I

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,230
have a function that Ivan shows them

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,730
yeah so yeah we just call it out more

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,770
and so that way there's no climbing

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,350
behind it's running this and loads my

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,660
posts and running to back of the dog the

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,950
patient loads and I understand example

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,870
right now because you can see exactly

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:55,980
what this does let's try it one more

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:57,920
time okay I haven't won in so late but

00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,490
hey I said at last we put the

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,649
interactions of that

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,740
a secular guy if you notice it looking

00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:06,990
to give and then while doesn't give us

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,480
showing it retrieves the new posts and

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,419
then rerun them down so now I will just

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,789
continue to get more and it's reloading

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:17,429
more posts right on page and not

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:26,990
reloading so that is all doing that

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:26,990
essentially everything that we grow here

00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:31,740
any questions on that I know I went

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,690
through it relatively quickly but it's

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,059
actually pretty clean with either stuff

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,100
really it doesn't take a lot of code to

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,809
do something like this yes ever need a

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,360
hooks that you can use to say you want

00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:46,950
some custody it on your posts yes we're

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,940
going to get to that yeah that's where a

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:56,460
talk about extending correct okay so

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,820
that is my my mini example that I walked

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,380
through taking an Asian and rendering at

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,899
some of the other things it can also do

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,279
if you want to take it one step further

00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:07,020
is you can actually so if you're going

00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,029
about the single post and people are

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,840
making comments normally when you fill

00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:14,429
up a comment the lazy load was greater

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,460
they act like it didn't like submit the

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:18,659
form and every load the first comment

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,210
there is the ability for people to

00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,070
submit comments with your editing using

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,020
the same stuff we did you have the

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:28,409
ability to do that I'll show you a small

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,360
closed in bit how that works but you can

00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:32,340
also manipulate it push it and not just

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,750
retrieve everything that you need air is

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:39,299
just retrieve all right so you guys

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:51,020
heard of we're pod WordPress and listen

00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:54,240
to this I was sitting outside I was like

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,669
alright so let's talk about this a

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,080
little bit differently no I'm gonna give

00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,690
you the examples of WordPress that is

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,330
CMS

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,760
we beat a lot of WordPress because the

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,220
CMS capabilities that is exportable big

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,120
system using form is the fact that

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,980
without the extendable manual tool and

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,070
is easy to use right and that's over

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:18,090
familiar with is this string which this

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,330
is going to be the very archaic soon but

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,020
goober

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:25,000
but this is kind of where let me see now

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,850
and this is what we're familiar with and

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,590
this is a month I post but whatever we

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:33,460
want to create a completely custom

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:35,290
adding for clients or for myself what we

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,990
want to have an attitude like we use

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,520
WordPress not just for a personal

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,230
website or business website need

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,660
WordPress pretty Congress if you use

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,540
WordPress for forms right and so way

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,120
maybe I don't care about posts I'm an

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,970
e-commerce blog or say I'm an ecommerce

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,830
site and I don't want to know about my

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,270
finances of I know my projects I want

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,170
help out those think that want to manage

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,790
it was different

00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:00,730
lightning that I'm in right now for

00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:02,710
WordPress is basically built to manage

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,410
the optics of you know the post pages

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,330
but there are better utilize depending

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,100
on the type of sites that we have the

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,600
nice thing about the recitative guys and

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,420
now we can create those new maybe eyes

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,070
are those new head in your bases as an

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,680
example you've been creating a veneer

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,860
it's just like this I'm not over this

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,570
and it looks completely different but it

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,840
was structured and organized in a way

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,900
that meets the needs of that particular

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,900
something and you know mention Gutenberg

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:35,920
Gutenberg is a new admin interface for

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,570
managing your posted optics and that is

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,880
right now being built on the rest you

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,220
guys ever talking about today so this is

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,680
a new interface that is using this

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,090
trusty go and yet as you can see if you

00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,920
completely new experience that's being

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,990
created and that's what I think it's

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,060
coming this is powerful I think Cooper

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,260
is just the iceberg the tip of the

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,960
iceberg of where we're going in

00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,270
particular because I can totally see

00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,040
this admin your face there's going to be

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,390
like series of admin your consists of

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,660
heading on the type of site that you're

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,550
building

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,770
that is optimized for those reasons and

00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:11,060
that's what the power I believe can

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,550
happen with the same time alright so

00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,720
let's talk a little bit about

00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,920
manipulating down I know I kind of lived

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,590
it to it

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,470
so you can see I'm using the clerk man I

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:24,290
just put method up Eric and not yet and

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:27,710
this is how you modify it as you can see

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:30,770
when I try to make this request sis are

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:34,180
you know that it just post them at all

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:37,250
so again as long as we're putting this

00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,180
we don't authorize it and going back to

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,640
that object

00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,650
you got a net nonce we need to close

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,960
again we don't have to worry too much

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,790
about this if you're using the client

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,740
library but if you are building this on

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,390
another third-party system let's say

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,850
we're happy for us and I'm using an IT

00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,520
iPhone app I need to access this data

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,700
they need to kind of be aware of these

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,700
things

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,080
okay so then this is I'm not going to go

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,060
too much into this white one mention to

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,060
mention that if you're using the postman

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,460
I was at first I say you should use

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:14,750
postman if you're working with these

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,670
guys just straight flat it is by party

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,040
amazing tool that I'm ready to stuff

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,500
that you can do all the time that makes

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,780
developing with a neat guy so much but

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,410
so I should have alluded to that

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:30,140
beginning but I'm saying it now but when

00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:32,330
you go to try to test things with your

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,430
guide you want to modify stuff usually

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,490
put a man because like I mentioned

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:39,800
breasts like every single call it's

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,660
independent of itself we have to have an

00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,590
authentication involved to modify the

00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,930
post and to do that you have to

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:51,050
essentially add a cookie as well as add

00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:52,910
a header to the request and so that's

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,700
what I'm showing you guys here which is

00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:59,840
we haven't provided authentication so

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,060
what we do is I basically load I log

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,750
into the site in my browser I go to my

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,560
console and I grabbed it for me from my

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,660
brother

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,940
he's here such as the wordpress blog

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,940
anyone essentially copy and paste that

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,310
cookie into a postman and then once I

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:21,830
have that I can make my request if I'm

00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:23,570
blocked so there's more I want to go so

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,730
far this by this one you'd be aware of

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,960
that again I will show slides you can

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,990
look through these things there are

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,540
links in here so that you can see and

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,130
retrieve on the create post they show

00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,960
you them all the examples for Hardison

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,170
one of these I showed you a few but you

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,330
can do all this and then take that some

00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,220
few steps further you can build in the

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,250
WordPress apparently you have all these

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,320
objects the posts categories tags comics

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,360
and so forth so all of those are about

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,100
to you even within the client library

00:28:50,360 --> 00:29:01,340
well there's an example of the video

00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:03,200
most using the client library back home

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,890
they use essentially retrieve it and

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,570
then instead the title page is missing

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:12,500
so it's really clean being able to do

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:18,080
that and then it was all those questions

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:20,000
so that is a short e the headless

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,460
concepts really creates a little Twitter

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,620
pieces from so let's talk about taking

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,560
this one step further extending this

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,000
beyond your basic objects insane

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,730
essentially what you want to do tonight

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,110
and more stuff to it

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,930
the first thing you can do is if you're

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,780
adding of yours and custom post types

00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:40,910
you can essentially automatically tell

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,560
them plus a post like to add itself to

00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,150
that client library so if you're

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,750
creating something new such as pets in

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,460
this example if I want to adopt pets

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,870
fetch you have to kind of tell the

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,630
request like I need to add this is the

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,100
best you got

00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,140
so that is an example so if you want to

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,060
do something like that like that

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,710
apparently isn't going to be there just

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,110
because your custom post it there it

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:06,290
won't be there so what we have to do is

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,880
essentially give it a rest controller so

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:11,750
V I

00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,070
Fat Controller into when I register my

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,780
custom post type so that's what you'll

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:19,160
have to do and then this is going to

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,539
help you add into that so then this the

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,429
first thing that you can do so if you're

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:24,950
do a custom post types that's the first

00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:26,600
thing that you want the second thing

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,350
that you want to do is let's say we just

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,660
want credit

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,780
you're on API endpoint that is not a

00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,250
doesn't boast I've just lately like

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,230
something out whenever you want to be

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,600
it's maybe you're taking two different

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,130
posts objects and you're manipulating

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,900
retrieve information that's really

00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,549
different matter you can do that as well

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,000
so let's talk a little bit about

00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:48,559
developing in kind on point as a whole

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,450
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,220
talk about the method so you should try

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,380
to stick to the rules of the get post

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,900
put delete when you're using those

00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,870
methods based off of retrieving creating

00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,610
updating and deleting so those we want

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,280
to use the authentication and we did we

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:07,010
want to validate user data so make sure

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,480
the data is being sent over good before

00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,760
we do anything then we perform the

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,650
actions and every routes for any JSON

00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,929
response so that is the life cycle what

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:19,940
you need to do in each item so this was

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:24,309
probably nothing I I realized that that

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:26,809
was a publishing using pepper is my

00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:36,620
let's say that we want to add a custom

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:43,820
point that so here's an I put example in

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:46,070
C um there is a fashion rest you can

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,620
register your home front so the route is

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:51,169
the URL that you're in eventually so you

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:54,679
can do is you can go version and then

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:58,000
you give the route is a lot of data so

00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,000
you can do things like I

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,510
and so you didn't write that declared a

00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,680
method it declared a fallback which is

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,420
essentially the pumpkin that's going to

00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,310
retrieve it down so that what we're

00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,910
doing here so that you can see not love

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:14,300
this moment that something yep I'm just

00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,470
having to retrieve close to this example

00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,770
you can see that I'm pulling it together

00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,690
and generating WS response was should

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:31,680
not be available to you with WordPress

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:33,180
that health center in the response and

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,700
then you returned so it's relatively

00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:40,950
straightforward you you're ready for

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:44,040
your bro so let's pretend that this

00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:46,140
hollow I only want certain users to be

00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,110
able to write does you just did that

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:53,640
right now they're calling anybody to

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:57,120
start adding to your site so we have to

00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:02,340
do the we have to have some type of so

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:05,300
there is another all that and in the

00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:07,650
permission callback you do your

00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,050
capabilities check essentially so right

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,150
now I'm using the current user can close

00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:14,850
their capabilities that happen to choose

00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,190
for this example but you could whatever

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,680
capability to happen system you do your

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,120
chat area this is going to use that

00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,860
authentication thing I'm talking about

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,980
so we have that competing we have that

00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,020
nonsense being passed in the request the

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,480
WordPress testing has been checked to

00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,370
see what the user is and then check to

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,350
see if that user can have that

00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:36,510
permission or capability and if they do

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,220
it allows them to continue into the

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,470
action that you did if they don't miss

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,540
anything back to the minute function

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,540
then we talked about it just returns it

00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,380
and then the last thing that we can do

00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,250
is validate the other so there's two

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,710
things permissions validation again we

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,190
have this parameter pocket as ours and

00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,909
then you can save the destory

00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,249
happiness

00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:03,959
and then Valley all that data comes in

00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:06,629
and I'm just doing it very simple in

00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:08,129
here was like America never code in

00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:12,960
there and you can do this for every

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:16,379
single variable API to validate the test

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,359
prep maybe they're variable their health

00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,279
status you only a month allow them to

00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:23,460
send this guy's over is published or

00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:35,369
draft and no other job evaluate the

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:38,879
validate this foundation this is

00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:41,339
returning a response there I know it's

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:47,569
really small but it's actually you can

00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:47,569
see that we have route the art

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,759
validation all that and retrievable

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:57,750
together so that in a nutshell how do

00:34:53,759 --> 00:35:00,150
you create your own custom and it's very

00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:07,890
simplified but you can really hopefully

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:11,460
see that what the possibilities so that

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:41,180
is everything I got any questions and I

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:41,180
didn't cover a lot very soon are you

00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:54,710
you're not using WordPress I would say

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:59,470
don't be with us then you don't use me

00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,470
and I don't see any time soon

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,360
I think the rest of you guys still even

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,310
though it's been around for a couple

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:16,790
years now I still think it's like super

00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:20,420
early but you still have it showed all

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,790
the three DS P libraries WB all the

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:27,410
hooks to generate the route to do all

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:30,370
the medication do you still not greatly

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,370
to be at the very basis

00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:58,620
yes that would be what I'd like to do

00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:00,750
everything for today stated conversation

00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:06,720
I hope you're sorry because you can

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:09,150
technically do a long right but yes that

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:14,940
would be a DPI and then every little

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:19,320
team that talks about essentially that

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:27,030
is what wrestle if you guys as a plugin

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:30,660
and then we build a team works very

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:33,240
similar I mean obviously we plugin you

00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,980
see all the same stuff works for you one

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,700
thing to mention though is if you're

00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,700
going to do like

00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:15,500
oh it would still it's not as long as

00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:20,120
the means because the guy is it's just

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:24,640
the back you have the ability to do all

00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:27,620
the objects regardless regardless of its

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,710
thickness generating those points

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:33,310
it's still the I can still go bill II I

00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:38,000
don't have that talks that you value

00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:41,000
that doesn't change it's just the it's

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,380
moral code if you might have if you're

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,470
trying to organize with both as a

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,840
developer of the API then you can build

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,710
it as a plugin and then they'll have

00:38:47,840 --> 00:39:29,300
demon talk to them you could do that but

00:38:50,710 --> 00:39:38,930
if you're building guys my time you're

00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:43,460
changing the theme it's not like if I

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:46,960
would mean if I got me actually just me

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,960
the theme has to know they exist

00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,900
faster

00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:08,580
you there yes there can be if so yes

00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:17,700
because uh so I'm not from excitable

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:20,970
things are always changing but yeah

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:24,990
there are some things that when the

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:35,670
crawlers things up there's a couple

00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:45,810
different ways there's something that

00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:50,490
you put in effects that went across what

00:40:45,810 --> 00:41:06,510
I do is I typically air outside of if

00:40:50,490 --> 00:41:08,460
I'm trying to go for SEO more SEO

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,440
friendly I think if you're building more

00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:30,570
like administration tools or you're

00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:33,630
building more functionality and that

00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,100
what we do is it would be because you

00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,820
already making easy to read less per

00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,820
little single those

00:41:48,599 --> 00:42:57,630
but in the instance that might show more

00:41:50,859 --> 00:42:57,630
like this yeah I was just wondering and

00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:16,300
if you are building like an iPhone you

00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:20,730
have to request but I were to build

00:43:16,300 --> 00:44:46,320
another website that was not

00:43:20,730 --> 00:44:56,970
I believe well that is nothing like your

00:44:46,320 --> 00:45:06,770
waiters server this is essentially we

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:06,770
can write but like everything

00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:24,540
like simple things that's a very small

00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:42,660
piece of information but this value in

00:45:24,540 --> 00:46:23,600
that and so like how makes it so much

00:45:42,660 --> 00:46:23,600
easier to like do this yeah yeah yeah

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:45,110
protection yeah so basically this is the

00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:45,110
EU that we have whether our site about

00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:54,420
what we are doing is does is and then

00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,620
the second part is trying to understand

00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,580
which is required us to take some steps

00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:03,050
because a lot of the sites that we're

00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,050
using are using third grade

00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:14,440
holidays Bobby it's a nice right so

00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,440
there's this if you go

00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,500
[Music]

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,519
[Music]

00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,269
[Music]

00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,179
[Music]

00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,280
[Music]

00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:43,980
now which is you give someone often

00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:47,579
right let's decide not even login I

00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:52,250
think I know anyone decide we're going

00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,250
to do something to that are we

00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:08,060
